chapter i   miss marjoribanks lost her mother when she was only fifteen and when to add to the misfortune she was absent at school and could not have it in her power to soothe her dear mamma's last moments as she herself said
words are sometimes very poor exponents of such an event but it happens now and then on the other hand that a plain intimation expresses too much and suggests emotion and suffering which in reality have but little if any existence
mrs marjoribanks poor lady had been an invalid for many years she had grown a little peevish in her loneliness not feeling herself of much account in this world
there are some rare natures that are content to acquiesce in the general neglect and forget themselves when they find themselves forgotten but it is unfortunately much more usual to take the plan adopted by mrs marjoribanks who devoted all her powers during the last ten years of her life to the solacement and care of that poor self which other people neglected
the consequence was that when she disappeared from her sofaexcept for the mere physical fact that she was no longer thereno one except her maid whose occupation was gone could have found out much difference
her husband it is true who had somewhere hidden deep in some secret corner of his physical organisation the remains of a heart experienced a certain sentiment of sadness when he reentered the house from which she had gone away for ever
but dr marjoribanks was too busy a man to waste his feelings on a mere sentiment
his daughter however was only fifteen and had floods of tears at her command as was natural at that age
all the way home she revolved the situation in her mind which was considerably enlightened by novels and popular philosophyfor the lady at the head of miss marjoribanks school was a devoted admirer of friends in council and was fond of bestowing that work as a prize with pencilmarks on the marginso that lucilla's mind had been cultivated and was brimful of the best of sentiments
she made up her mind on her journey to a great many virtuous resolutions for in such a case as hers it was evidently the duty of an only child to devote herself to her father's comfort and become the sunshine of his life as so many young persons of her age have been known to become in literature
miss marjoribanks had a lively mind and was capable of grasping all the circumstances of the situation at a glance
thus between the outbreaks of her tears for her mother it became apparent to her that she must sacrifice her own feelings and make a cheerful home for papa and that a great many changes would be necessary in the householdchanges which went so far as even to extend to the furniture
miss marjoribanks sketched to herself as she lay back in the corner of the railway carriage with her veil down how she would wind herself up to the duty of presiding at her papa's dinnerparties and charming everybody by her good humour and brightness and devotion to his comfort and how when it was all over she would withdraw and cry her eyes out in her own room and be found in the morning languid and wornout but always heroical ready to go downstairs and assist at dear papa's breakfast and keep up her smiles for him till he had gone out to his patients
altogether the picture was a very pretty one and considering that a great many young ladies in deep mourning put force upon their feelings in novels and maintain a smile for the benefit of the unobservant male creatures of whom they have the charge the idea was not at all extravagant considering that miss marjoribanks was but fifteen
she was not however exactly the kind of figure for this mise en scne
when her schoolfellows talked of her to their friendsfor lucilla was already an important personage at mount pleasantthe most common description they gave her was that she was a large girl and there was great truth in the adjective
she was not to be described as a tall girlwhich conveys an altogether different ideabut she was large in all particulars full and welldeveloped with somewhat large features not at all pretty as yet though it was known in mount pleasant that somebody had said that such a face might ripen into beauty and become grandiose for anything anybody could tell
miss marjoribanks was not vain but the word had taken possession of her imagination as was natural and solaced her much when she made the painful discovery that her gloves were half a number larger and her shoes a hairbreadth broader than those of any of her companions but the hands and feet were both perfectly well shaped and being at the same time well clothed and plump were much more presentable and pleasant to look upon than the lean rudimentary schoolgirl hands with which they were surrounded
to add to these excellences lucilla had a mass of hair which if it could but have been cleared a little in its tint would have been golden though at present it was nothing more than tawny and curly to exasperation
she wore it in large thick curls which did not however float or wave or do any of the graceful things which curls ought to do for it had this aggravating quality that it would not grow long but would grow ridiculously unmanageably thick to the admiration of her companions but to her own despair for there was no knowing what to do with those short but ponderous locks
these were the external characteristics of the girl who was going home to be a comfort to her widowed father and meant to sacrifice herself to his happiness
in the course of her rapid journey she had already settled upon everything that had to be done or rather to speak truly had rehearsed everything according to the habit already acquired by a quick mind a good deal occupied with itself
first she meant to fall into her father's armsforgetting with that singular facility for overlooking the peculiarities of others which belongs to such a character that dr marjoribanks was very little given to embracing and that a hasty kiss on her forehead was the warmest caress he had ever given his daughterand then to rush up to the chamber of death and weep over dear mamma
and to think i was not there to soothe her last moments
lucilla said to herself with a sob and with feelings sufficiently real in their way
after this the devoted daughter made up her mind to come downstairs again pale as death but selfcontrolled and devote herself to papa
perhaps if great emotion should make him tearless as such cases had been known miss marjoribanks would steal into his arms unawares and so surprise him into weeping
all this went briskly through her mind undeterred by the reflection that tears were as much out of the doctor's way as embraces and in this mood she sped swiftly along in the inspiration of her first sorrow as she imagined but in reality to suffer her first disappointment which was of a less soothing character than that mild and manageable grief
when miss marjoribanks reached home her mother had been dead for twentyfour hours and her father was not at the door to receive her as she had expected but by the bedside of a patient in extremity who could not consent to go out of the world without the doctor
this was a sad reversal of her intentions but lucilla was not the woman to be disconcerted
she carried out the second part of her programme without either interference or sympathy except from mrs marjoribanks's maid who had some hopes from the moment of her arrival
i can't abear to think as i'm to be parted from you all miss sobbed the faithful attendant
i've lost the best missus as ever was and i shouldn't mind going after her
whenever any one gets a good friend in this world they're the first to be took away said the weeping handmaiden who naturally saw her own loss in the most vivid light
ah ellis cried miss marjoribanks reposing her sorrow in the arms of this anxious attendant we must try to be a comfort to poor papa
with this end lucilla made herself very troublesome to the soberminded doctor during those few dim days before the faint and daily lessening shadow of poor mrs marjoribanks was removed altogether from the house
when that sad ceremony had taken place and the doctor returned serious enough heaven knows to the great house where the faded helpless woman who had notwithstanding been his love and his bride in other days lay no longer on the familiar sofa the crisis arrived which miss marjoribanks had rehearsed so often but after quite a different fashion
the widower was tearless indeed but not from excess of emotion
on the contrary a painful heaviness possessed him when he became aware how little real sorrow was in his mind and how small an actual loss was this loss of his wife which bulked before the world as an event of just as much magnitude as the loss for example which poor mr lake the drawingmaster was at the same moment suffering
it was even sad in another point of view to think of a human creature passing out of the world and leaving so little trace that she had ever been there
as for the pretty creature whom dr marjoribanks had married she had vanished into thin air years and years ago
these thoughts were heavy enoughperhaps even more overwhelming than that grief which develops love to its highest point of intensity
but such were not precisely the kind of reflections which could be solaced by paternal attendrissement over a weeping and devoted daughter
it was may and the weather was warm for the season but lucilla had caused the fire to be lighted in the large gloomy library where dr marjoribanks always sat in the evenings with the idea that it would be a comfort to him and for the same reason she had ordered tea to be served there instead of the dinner for which her father as she imagined could have little appetite
when the doctor went in to his favourite seclusion tired and heated and sadfor even on the day of his wife's funeral the favourite doctor of carlingford had patients to think ofthe very heaviness of his thoughts gave warmth to his indignation
he had longed for the quiet and the coolness and the solitude of his library apart from everybody and when he found it radiant with firelight tea set on the table and lucilla crying by the fire in her new crape the effect upon a temper by no means perfect may be imagined
the unfortunate man threw both the windows wide open and rang the bell violently and gave instant orders for the removal of the unnecessary fire and the teaservice
let me know when dinner is ready he said in a voice like thunder and if miss marjoribanks wants a fire let it be lighted in the drawingroom
lucilla was so much taken by surprise by this sudden overthrow of her programme that she submitted as a girl of much less spirit might have done and suffered herself and her fire and her teathings to be dismissed upstairs where she wept still more at sight of dear mamma's sofa and where ellis came to mingle her tears with those of her young mistress and to beg dear miss lucilla for the sake of her precious 'elth and her dear papa to be persuaded to take some tea
on the whole master stood lessened in the eyes of all the household by his ability to eat his dinner and his resentment at having his habitudes disturbed
them men would eat and drink if we was all in our graves said the indignant cook who indeed had a real grievance and the outraged sentiment of the kitchen was avenged by a bad and hasty dinner which the doctor though generally very particular swallowed without remark
about an hour afterwards he went upstairs to the drawingroom where miss marjoribanks was waiting for him much less at ease than she had expected to be
though he gave a little sigh at the sight of his wife's sofa he did not hesitate to sit down upon it and even to draw it a little out of its position which as lucilla described afterwards was like a knife going into her heart
though indeed she had herself decided already in the intervals of her tears that the drawingroom furniture had got very faded and shabby and that it would be very expedient to have it renewed for the new reign of youth and energy which was about to commence
as for the doctor though miss marjoribanks thought him insensible his heart was heavy enough
his wife had gone out of the world without leaving the least mark of her existence except in that large girl whose spirits and forces were unbounded but whose discretion at the present moment did not seem much greater than her mother's
instead of thinking of her as a comfort the doctor felt himself called upon to face a new and unexpected embarrassment
it would have been a satisfaction to him just then to have been left to himself and permitted to work on quietly at his profession and to write his papers for the lancet and to see his friends now and then when he chose for dr marjoribanks was not a man who had any great need of sympathy by nature or who was at all addicted to demonstrations of feeling consequently he drew his wife's sofa a little farther from the fire and took his seat on it soberly quite unaware that by so doing he was putting a knife into his daughter's heart
i hope you have had something to eat lucilla he said don't get into that foolish habit of flying to tea as a man flies to a dram
it's a more innocent stimulant but it's the same kind of intention
i am not so much against a fire it has always a kind of cheerful look
oh papa cried his daughter with a flood of indignant tears you can't suppose i want anything to look cheerful this dreadful day
i am far from blaming you my dear said the doctor it is natural you should cry
i am sorry i did not write for my sister to come who would have taken care of you but i dislike strangers in the house at such a time
however i hope lucilla you will soon feel yourself able to return to school occupation is always the best remedy and you will have your friends and companions  papa
cried miss marjoribanks and then she summoned courage and rushed up to him and threw herself and her clouds of crape on the carpet at his side and it may here be mentioned that lucilla had seized the opportunity to have her mourning made long which had been the desire of her heart baffled by mamma and governess for at least a year
papa
she exclaimed with fervour raising to him her tearstained face and clasping her fair plump hands oh don't send me away
i was only a silly girl the other day but this has made me a woman
though i can never never hope to take dear mamma's place and beallthat she was to you still i feel i can be a comfort to you if you will let me
you shall not see me cry any more cried lucilla with energy rubbing away her tears
i will never give way to my feelings
i will ask for no companionsnornor anything
as for pleasure that is all over
oh papa you shall never see me regret anything or wish for anything
i will give up everything in the world to be a comfort to you
this address which was utterly unexpected drove dr marjoribanks to despair
he said get up lucilla but the devoted daughter knew better than to get up
she hid her face in her hands and rested her hands upon her mother's sofa where the doctor was sitting and the sobs of that emotion which she meant to control henceforward echoed through the room
it is only for this oncei cancannot help it she cried
when her father found that he could neither soothe her nor succeed in raising her he got up himself which was the only thing left to him and began to walk about the room with hasty steps
her mother too had possessed this dangerous faculty of tears and it was not wonderful if the soberminded doctor roused for the first time to consider his little girl as a creature possessed of individual character should recognise with a thrill of dismay the appearance of the same qualities which had wearied his life out and brought his youthful affections to an untimely end
lucilla was it is true as different from her mother as summer from winter but dr marjoribanks had no means of knowing that his daughter was only doing her duty by him in his widowhood according to a programme of filial devotion resolved upon in accordance with the best models some days before
accordingly when her sobs had ceased her father returned and raised her up not unkindly and placed her in her chair
in doing so the doctor put his finger by instinct upon lucilla's pulse which was sufficiently calm and regulated to reassure the most anxious parent
and then a furtive momentary smile gleamed for a single instant round the corners of his mouth
it is very good of you to propose sacrificing yourself for me he said and if you would sacrifice your excitement in the meantime and listen to me quietly it would really be somethingbut you are only fifteen lucilla and i have no wish to take you from school just now wait till i have done
your poor mother is gone and it is very natural you should cry but you were a good child to her on the whole which will be a comfort to you
we did everything that could be thought of to prolong her days and when that was impossible to lessen what she had to suffer and we have every reason to hope said the doctor as indeed he was accustomed to say in the exercise of his profession to mourning relatives that she's far better off now than if she had been with us
when that is said i don't know that there is anything more to add
i am not fond of sacrifices either one way or another and i've a great objection to any one making a sacrifice for me  but oh papa it would be no sacrifice said lucilla if you would only let me be a comfort to you
that is just where it is my dear said the steady doctor i have been used to be left a great deal to myself and i am not prepared to say that the responsibility of having you here without a mother to take care of you and all your lessons interrupted would not neutralise any comfort you might be
you see said dr marjoribanks trying to soften matters a little a man is what his habits make him and i have been used to be left a great deal to myself
it answers in some cases but i doubt if it would answer with me
and then there was a pause in which lucilla wept and stifled her tears in her handkerchief with a warmer flood of vexation and disappointment than even her natural grief had produced
of course papa if i can't be any comforti willgo back to school she sobbed with a touch of sullenness which did not escape the doctor's ear
yes my dear you will certainly go back to school said the peremptory father i never had any doubt on that subject
you can stay over sunday and rest yourself
monday or tuesday will be time enough to go back to mount pleasant and now you had better ring the bell and get somebody to bring you somethingor i'll see to that when i go downstairs
it's getting late and this has been a fatiguing day
i'll send you up some negus and i think you had better go to bed
and with these commonplace words dr marjoribanks withdrew in calm possession of the field
as for lucilla she obeyed him and betook herself to her own room and swallowed her negus with a sense not only of defeat but of disappointment and mortification which was very unpleasant
to go back again and be an ordinary schoolgirl after the pomp and woe in which she had come away was naturally a painful thought she who had ordered her mourning to be made long and contemplated new furniture in the drawingroom and expected to be mistress of her father's house not to speak of the still dearer privilege of being a comfort to him and now after all her active mind was to be condemned over again to verbs and chromatic scales though she felt within herself capacities so much more extended
miss marjoribanks did not by any means learn by this defeat to take the characters of the other person in her little drama into consideration when she rehearsed her pet scenes hereafterfor that is a knowledge slowly acquiredbut she was wise enough to know when resistance was futile and like most people of lively imagination she had a power of submitting to circumstances when it became impossible to change them
thus she consented to postpone her reign if not with a good grace yet still without foolish resistance and retired with the full honours of war
she had already rearranged all the details and settled upon all the means possible of preparing herself for what she called the charge of the establishment when her final emancipation took place before she returned to school
papa thought me too young she said when she reached mount pleasant though it was dreadful to come away and leave him alone with only the servants but dear miss martha you will let me learn all about political economy and things to help me manage everything for now that dear mamma is gone there is nobody but me to be a comfort to papa
and by this means miss marjoribanks managed to influence the excellent woman who believed in friends in council and to direct the future tenor of her own education while at least in that one moment of opportunity she had achieved long dresses which was a visible mark of womanhood and a step which could not be retraced
chapter ii   dr marjoribanks was so far from feeling the lack of his daughter's powers of consolation that he kept her at mount pleasant for three years longer during which time it is to be supposed he managed to be comfortable after a benighted fashiongood enough for a man of fifty who had come to an end of his illusions
to be sure there were in the world and even in carlingford kind women who would not have objected to take charge of the doctor and his establishment and be a comfort to him but on the whole it was undeniable that he managed tolerably well in external matters and gave very good men's dinners and kept everything in perfect order so far as it went
naturally the fairer part of existence was left out altogether in that grim though wellordered house but then he was only a man and a doctor and knew no better and while the feminine part of grange lane regarded him with natural pity not only for what he lacked but for a still more sad defect his total want of perception on the subject their husbands and fathers rather liked to dine with the doctor and brought home accounts of sauces which were enough to drive any woman to despair
some of the ladies of grange lanemrs chiley for example who was fond of good living herself and liked as she said a little varietylaid siege to the doctor and did their best to coax his receipts out of him but dr marjoribanks knew better than that
he gave all the credit to his cook like a man of sense and as that functionary was known in carlingford to be utterly regardless and unprincipled in respect to gravybeef and the materials for stock or consomm as some people called it society was disinclined to exert its ordinary arts to seduce so great an artiste from the kitchen of her indulgent master
and then there were other ladies who took a different tone
dr marjoribanks poor man has nothing but his table to take up his mind said mrs centum who had six children i never heard that the heart could be nourished upon sauces for my part and for a man who has his children's future to think of i must say i am surprised at you mr centum
as for young mrs woodburn her reply was still more decisive though milder in its tone
poor cook
i am so sorry for her said the gentle young matron
you know you always like something for breakfast charles and then there is the children's dinner and our lunch and the servants' dinner so that the poor thing is worn out before she comes to what you call the great event of the day and you know how angry you were when i asked for a kitchenmaid for her poor soul
the consequence of all this was that dr marjoribanks remained unrivalled in grange lane in this respect at least
when rumours arose in carlingford of a possible second marriage for the doctorand such rumours naturally arose three or four times in the course of the three yearsthe men of grange lane said heaven forbid
no wife in the world could replace nancy said colonel chiley after that fervent aspiration and none could put up with her while on the other side there were curious speculations afloat as to the effect upon the house and especially the table of the daughter's return
when a young woman comes to be eighteen it is difficult to keep her at school and though the doctor had staved off the danger for the moment by sending lucilla off along with one of her schoolfellows whose family was going abroad to make orthodox acquaintance with all the swiss mountains and all the italian capitals still that was plainly an expedient for the moment and a new mistress to the house which had got along so well without any mistress was inevitable
so that it cannot be denied miss marjoribanks's advent was regarded in carlingford with as much interest and curiosity as she could have wished
for it was already known that the doctor's daughter was not a mild young lady easy to be controlled but on the contrary had all the energy and determination to have her own way which naturally belonged to a girl who possessed a considerable chin and a mouth which could shut and tightly curling tawny tresses which were still more determined than she was to be arranged only according to their inclination
it was even vaguely reported that some passagesofarms had occurred between miss marjoribanks and the redoubtable nancy during the short and uncertain opportunities which were afforded by holidays and the community accordingly regarded as an affair of almost municipal importance lucilla's final return home
as for the young lady herself though she was at school she was conscious of having had a career not without importance even during these three years of pupilage
since the day when she began to read political economy with miss martha blount who though the second sister was the directing spirit of the establishment lucilla had exercised a certain influence upon the school itself which was very satisfactory
perhaps her course might be a little deficient in grace but grace after all is but a secondary quality and at all events miss marjoribanks went straight forward leaving an unquestionable wake behind her and running down with indifference the little skiffs in her way
she was possessed by nature of that kind of egotism or rather egoism which is predestined to impress itself by its perfect reality and good faith upon the surrounding world
there are people who talk of themselves and think of themselves as it were under protest and with depreciation not actually able to convince themselves that anybody cares but lucilla for her part had the calmest and most profound conviction that when she discussed her own doings and plans and clevernesses she was bringing forward the subject most interesting to her audience as well as to herself
such a conviction is never without its fruits
to be sure there were always one or two independent spirits who revolted but for the crowd it soon became impressed with a profound belief in the creed which miss marjoribanks supported so firmly
this conviction of the importance and value of her own proceedings made lucilla as she grew older a copious and amusing conversationalista rank which few people who are indifferent to or do not believe in themselves can attain to
one thing she had made up her mind to as soon as she should return home and that was to revolutionise society in carlingford
on the whole she was pleased with the success of the doctor's dinners though a little piqued to think that they owed nothing to herself but lucilla whose instinct of government was of the true despotic order and who had no objection to stoop if by that means she could conquer had no such designs against nancy as were attributed to her by the expectant audience in carlingford
on the contrary she was quite as much disposed as her father was to take nancy for primeminister for miss marjoribanks though too much occupied with herself to divine the characteristic points of other people had a sensible and thorough belief in those superficial general truths which most minds acquiesce in without taking the trouble to believe
she knew for example that there was a great difference between the brilliant society of london or of paris which appears in books where women have generally the best of it and can rule in their own right and even the very best society of a country town where husbands are very commonly unmanageable and have a great deal more of their own way in respect to the houses they will or will not go to than is good for that inferior branch of the human family
miss marjoribanks had the good sense to see and appreciate these details and she knew that a good dinner was a great attraction to a man and that in carlingford at least when these refractory mortals were secured the wives and daughters would necessarily follow
besides as is not uncommon with women who are clever women and aware of the fact miss marjoribanks preferred the society of men and rather liked to say so
with all these intentions in her mind it may be imagined that she received coolly enough the invitation of her friend to join in the grand tour and the ready consent given by her father when he heard of it
but even the grand tour was a tool which lucilla saw how to make use of
nowadays when people go everywhere an untravelled woman would find it so much the harder to keep up the rle of a leader of society to which she had devoted herself and she felt to the depth of her heart the endless advantage to her future conversation of the experiences to be acquired in switzerland and italy
but she rejected with scorn the insinuation of other accidents that might occur on the way
you will never come back again lucilla said one of her companions you will marry some enchanting italian with a beautiful black beard and a voice like an angel and he'll sing serenades to you and do all sorts of things oh how i wish i was you
that may be said miss marjoribanks but i shall never marry an italian my dear
i don't think i shall marry anybody for a long time
i want to amuse myself
i wonder by the way if it would improve my voice to take lessons in italy
did i ever tell you of the italian nobleman that was so very attentive to me that christmas i spent at sissy vernon's
he was very handsome
i suppose they really are all very handsomeexcept of course the italian masters but i did not pay any attention to him
my object dear and you know it is to return home as well educated as possible to be a comfort to dear papa
yes dear lucilla said the sympathetic girl and it is so good of you but do tell me about the italian noblemanwhat did he look likeand what did he say
oh as for what he said that is quite a different matter said lucilla but it is not what they say but the way they say it that is the fun
i did not give him the least encouragement
as for that i think a girl can always stop a man when she does not care for him
it depends on whether you intend him to commit himself or not miss marjoribanks continued and fixed her eyes meditatively but intently upon her friend's face
whether i intendoh goodness lucilla
how can you speak so
as if i ever intended anything said her companion confused yet flattered by the possibility to which the elder sage answered calmly with all the composure in the world
no i never supposed you did i was thinking of myself said lucilla as if indeed that was the only reasonable subject of thought
you know i have seen a good deal of the world one way and another with going to spend the holidays and i could tell you quantities of things
it is quite astonishing how much experience one gets
when i was at midhurst at easter there was my cousin tom who was quite ridiculous i declare he nearly brought things to an explanation fannywhich of course of all things in the world i most wanted to avoid
oh but why lucilla
cried fanny full of delight and wonder i do so want to know what they say when they makeexplanations as you call them
oh do tell me lucilla why
my dear said miss marjoribanks a cousin of my own
and only twentyone and reading for the bar
in the first place my aunt would never have forgiven me and i am very fond of my aunt
it's so nice to like all one's relations
i know some girls who can't bear theirs
and then a boy not much older than myself with nothing but what his mother pleases
fortunately he did not just say the words so i escaped that time but of course i could understand perfectly what he meant
but oh lucilla tell me the words cried the persistent questioner do there's a darling
i am quite sure you have heard themand i should so like to know exactly what they saydo they go down on their kneesor do they try to take your hand as they always do in novelsor what do they dooh lucilla tell me there's a dear
nonsense said lucilla i only want you to understand that i am not likely to fall into any danger of that sort
my only ambition fanny as i have told you often is to go home to carlingford and be a comfort to dear papa
yes said fanny kissing her devoted companion and it is so good of you dear but then you cannot go on all your life being a comfort to dear papa said the intelligent girl bethinking herself and looking again with some curiosity in lucilla's face
we must leave that to providence said miss marjoribanks with a sense of paying a compliment to providence in entrusting it with such a responsibility
i have always been guided for the best hitherto she continued with an innocent and unintentional profanity which sounded solemn to her equally innocent companion and i don't doubt i shall be so till the end
from which it will be perceived that miss marjoribanks was of the numerous class of religionists who keep up civilities with heaven and pay all the proper attentions and show their respect for the divine government in a manner befitting persons who know the value of their own approbation
the conversation dropped at this point for lucilla was too important a person to be left to the undivided possession of an inquisitive innocent like fanny middleton who was only sixteen and had never had even a flirtation in her own person
there were no carlingford girls at mount pleasant except poor little rose lake the drawingmaster's second daughter who had been received on dr marjoribanks's recommendation and who heard the little children their geography and reading and gave them little lessons in drawing by way of paying for her own education but then rose was entirely out of miss marjoribanks's way and could never count for anything in her designs for the future
the girls at mount pleasant were good girls on the whole and were rather improved by the influence of lucilla who was extremely goodnatured and so long as her superiority was duly acknowledged was ready to do anything for anybodyso that rose lake was not at all badly off in her inferior position
she could be made useful too which was a great point in her favour and miss marjoribanks who possessed by nature some of the finest qualities of a ruler instinctively understood and appreciated the instruments that came to her hand
as for rose she had been brought up at the school of design in carlingford of which under the supervision of the authorities who in those days inhabited marlborough house mr lake was the master
rose was the pride of the school in the peaceable days before her mother died she did not know much else poor child except novels but her copies from the round filled her father with admiration and her design for a honitonlace flounce a spirited composition of dragons' tails and the striking plant called teazle which flourishes in the neighbourhood of carlingford for mr lake had leanings towards preraphaelitism was thought by the best judges to show a wonderful amount of feeling for art and just missed being selected for the prize
a girl with such a talent was naturally much appreciated in mount pleasant
she made the most charming design for miss marjoribanks's handkerchieflucilla in gothic characters enclosed in a wreath of forgetmenots skilfully combined with thistleleaves which rose took great pains to explain were so much better adapted to ornamentation than foliage of a less distinct character and the young draftswoman was so charmed by lucilla's enthusiastic admiration that she volunteered to work the design in the cambric which was a much more serious matter
this was on the eve of miss marjoribanks's final departure from school
she was to spend a year abroad to the envy of all whom she left behind but for herself lucilla was not elated
she thought it very probable that she would ascend mont blanc as far as the grands mulets at least and of course in spring go up vesuvius having got through the carnival and miserere and all the balls in rome but none of these things moved her out of her usual composure
she took it all in the way of business as she had taken her french and her german and her singing and her political economy
as she stepped into the steamboat at dover which was to convey her to scenes so new lucilla felt more and more that she who held the reorganisation of society in carlingford in her hands was a woman with a mission
she was going abroad as the heirapparent went to america and the holy land to complete her education and fit herself by an examination of the peculiarities of other nations for an illustrious and glorious reign at home
chapter iii   it may be well to seize the opportunity of miss marjoribanks's travels through which it is unnecessary to follow her as they have nothing particular to do with the legitimate history of her great undertaking to explain a little the state of affairs in carlingford before this distinguished revolutionary began her labours
it is something like going back into the prehistoric periodthose ages of the flint which only ingenious quarrymen and learned geologists can elucidateto recall the social condition of the town before miss marjoribanks began her thursday evenings before st roque's chapel was built or thought of while mr bury the evangelical rector was still in full activity and before old mr tufton at salem chapel who sometimes drank tea at the rectory and thus had a kind of clandestine entrance into the dim outskirts of that chaos which was then called society had his first stroke
from this latter circumstance alone the entirely disorganised condition of affairs will be visible at a glance
it is true mr vincent who succeeded mr tufton was received by lady western in days when public opinion had made great advances but then lady western was the most goodnatured creature in the world and gave an invitation when it happened to come into her head without the least regard for the consequences and after all mr vincent was very nicelooking and clever and quite presentable
fortunately however the period to which we allude was prior to the entrance of lady western into grange lane
she was a very pretty woman and knew how to look like a lady of fashion which is always of importance but she was terribly inconsequent as miss marjoribanks said and her introductions were not in the least to be depended upon
she was indeed quite capable of inviting a family of retired drapers to meet the best people in grange lane for no better reason than to gratify her protgs which of course was a proceeding calculated to strike at the roots of all society
fortunately for carlingford its reorganisation was in abler hands
affairs were in an utterly chaotic state at the period when this record commences
there was nothing which could be properly called a centre in the entire town
to be sure grange lane was inhabited as at present by the best families in carlingford but then without organisation what good does it do to have a number of people together
for example mr bury was utterly unqualified to take any lead
mrs bury had been dead a long time and the daughters were married and the rector's maiden sister who lived with him was entirely of his own way of thinking and asked people to teaparties which were like methodists' classmeetings and where mr tufton was to be met with and sometimes other dissenters to whom the rector gave what he called the right hand of fellowship
but he never gave anything else to society except weak tea and thin breadandbutter which was fare the ladies said which the gentlemen did not relish
i never can induce charles to go out to tea said young mrs woodburn piteously he won't and there is an end of it
after dinner he thinks of nothing but an easychair and the papers and my dear miss bury what can i do
it is a great pity my dear that your husband's carelessness should deprive you of the benefit of christian conversation but to be sure it is your duty to stay with him and i hope it will be made up to you at home miss bury would say
as for the rector his favourites were devoted to him and as he always saw enough of familiar faces at his sister's teaparties he took no account of the defaulters
then there was dr marjoribanks who gave only dinners to which naturally as there was no lady in the house ladies could not be invited and who besides was rather a drawback than a benefit to society since he made the men quite intolerable and filled them with such expectations in the way of cookery that they never were properly content with a good family dinner after
then the ladies from whom something might justly have been expected in the way of making society pleasantsuch as mrs centum and mrs woodburn for example who had everything they could desire and the most liberal housekeeping allowanceswere either incapacitated by circumstances which was a polite term in use at carlingford and meant babies or by character
mrs woodburn liked nothing so well as to sit by the fire and read novels and take off her neighbours when any one called on her and of course the lady who was her audience on one occasion left with the comfortable conviction that next time she would be the victim a circumstance which indeed did not make the offender unpopularfor there were very few people in carlingford who could be amusing even at the expense of their neighboursbut made it quite impossible that she should ever do anything in the way of knitting people together and making a harmonious whole out of the scraps and fragments of society
as for mrs chiley she was old and had not energy enough for such an undertaking and besides she had no children and disliked bustle and trouble and was of opinion that the colonel never enjoyed his dinner if he had more than four people to help him to eat it and in short you might have gone over grange lane house by house finding a great deal of capital material but without encountering a single individual capable of making anything out of it
such was the lamentable condition at the moment this history commences of society in carlingford
and yet nobody could say that there were not very good elements to make society with
when you add to a man capable of giving excellent dinners like dr marjoribanks another man like young mr cavendish mrs woodburn's brother who was a wit and a man of fashion and belonged to one of the best clubs in town and brought down gossip with the bloom on it to grange lane and when you join to mrs centum who was always so good and so much out of temper that it was safe to calculate on something amusing from her the languid but trenchant humour of mrs woodburnnot to speak of their husbands who were perfectly available for the background and all the nephews and cousins and grandchildren who constantly paid visits to old mr western and colonel chiley and the browns when they were at home with their floating suite of admirers and the young ladies who sang and the young ladies who sketched and the men who went out with the hounds when business permitted them and the people who came about the town when there was an election and the barristers who made the circuit and the gay people who came to the races not to speak of the varying chances of curates who could talk or play the piano with which mr bury favoured his parishionersfor he changed his curates very often and the occasional visits of the lesser county people and the country clergymenit will be plainly apparent that all that was wanting to carlingford was a masterhand to blend these different elements
there had even been a few feeble preliminary attempts at this great work which had failed as such attempts always fail when they are premature and when the real agent of the change is already on the way but preparations and presentiments had taken vague possession of the mind of the town as has always been observed to be the case before a great revolution or when a man destined to put his mark on his generation as the newspapers say is about to appear
to be sure it was not a man this time but miss marjoribanks but the atmosphere thrilled and trembled to the advent of the new luminary all the same
yet at the same time the world of carlingford had not the least idea of the real quarter from which the sovereign intelligence which was to develop it from chaos into order and harmony was effectivement to come
some people had hoped in mrs woodburn before she fell into her present languor of appearance and expression and a great many people hoped in mr cavendish's wife if he married as he was said to intend to do for this gentleman who was in the habit of describing himself no doubt very truthfully as one of the cavendishes was a person of great consideration in grange lane and some hoped in a new rector for it was apparent that mr bury could not last very long
thus with the ordinary shortsightedness of the human species carlingford blinded itself and turned its eyes in every direction in the world rather than in that of the swiss mountains which were being climbed at that moment by a large and blooming young woman with tawny short curls and alert decided movements so little do we know what momentous issues may hang upon the most possible accident
had that energetic traveller slipped but an inch farther upon the mer de glacehad she taken that other step which she was with difficulty persuaded not to take on the wengern alpthere would have been an end of all the hopes of social importance for carlingford
but the good fairies took care of lucilla and her mission and saved her from the precipice and the crevasses and instinctively the air at home got note of what was coming and whispered the news mysteriously through the keyholes
miss marjoribanks is coming home the unsuspecting male public said to itself as it returned from dr marjoribanks's dinners with a certain distressing but mistaken presentiment that these delights were to come to an end and the ladies repeated the same piece of news conjoining with it benevolent intimations of their intention to call upon her and make the poor thing feel herself at home
perhaps she may be amusing mrs woodburn was good enough to add but these words meant only that perhaps lucilla who was coming to set them all right was worthy of being placed in the satirist's collection along with mrs centum and mrs chiley
thus while the town ripened more and more for her great mission and the ignorant human creatures who were to be her subjects showed their usual blindness and ignorance the time drew nearer and nearer for miss marjoribanks's return
chapter iv   my daughter is coming home nancy said dr marjoribanks
you will have to make preparations for her immediately
so far as i can make out from this letter she will arrive tomorrow by the halfpast five train
well sir said nancy with the tone of a woman who makes the best of a misfortune it ain't every young lady as would have the sense to fix an hour like that
ladies is terrible tiresome in that way they'll come in the middle o' the day when a body don't know in the world what to have for them or they'll come at night when a body's tired and ain't got the heart to go into a supper
there was always a deal of sense in miss lucilla when she hadn't got nothing in her head
just so said dr marjoribanks who was rather relieved to have got through the announcement so easily
you will see that her room is ready and everything comfortable and of course tomorrow she and i will dine alone
yes sir said nancy but this assent was not given in the decisive tone of a woman whose audience was over and then she was seized with a desire to arrange in a more satisfactory manner the cold beef on the sideboard
when she had secured this little interval for thought she returned again to the table where her master ate his breakfast with a presentiment
if you please sir said nancy not to give you no vexation nor trouble which every one knows as it has been the aim o' my life to spare you as has so much on your mind
but it's best to settle afore commencing and then we needn't have no heartburning
if you please am i to take my orders of miss lucilla or of you as i've always been used to
in the missus's time said nancy with modest confidence as was a good missus and never gave no trouble as long as she had her soup and her jelly comfortable it was always you as said what there was to be for dinner
i don't make no objection to doing up a nice little luncheon for miss lucilla and giving a little more thought now and again to the sweets but it ain't my part to tell you sir as a lady's taste and more special a young lady's ain't to be expected to be the same as yours and mine as has been cultivated like
i'm not one as likes contention continued the domestic oracle but i couldn't abear to see a good master put upon and if it should be as miss lucilla sets her mind upon messes as ain't got no taste in them and milkpuddings and stuff like the most of the ladies i'd just like to know out of your own mouth afore the commencement what i'm to do
dr marjoribanks was so moved by this appeal that he laid down his knife and contemplated the alarming future with some dismay
it is to be hoped miss lucilla will know better he said
she has a great deal of good sense and it is to be hoped that she will be wise enough to consult the tastes of the house
but the doctor was not to be let off so easily
as you say sir everything's to be hoped said nancy steadily but there's amany ladies as don't seem to me to have got no taste to their mouths and it ain't as if it was a thing that could be left to hopes
supposin' as it comes to that sir what am i to do
well said the doctor who was himself a little puzzled you know miss lucilla is nineteen nancy and my only child and the natural mistress of the house
sir said nancy austerely them is things as it ain't needful to name that ain't the question as i was asking
supposin' as things come to such a point what am i to do
bless me
it's halfpast nine said the doctor and i have an appointment
you can come just as usual when we are at breakfast that will be the best way he said as he went out at the door and chuckled a little to himself when he felt he had escaped
lucilla is her mother's daughter it is true he said to himself when he had got into the safe seclusion of his brougham with a degree of doubt in his tone which was startling to say the least of it from the lips of a medical man but she is my child all the same he added briskly with returning confidence and in this conviction there was something which reassured the doctor
he rubbed his hands as he bowled along to his appointment and thought within himself that if she turned out a girl of spirit as he expected it would be good fun to see lucilla's struggle with nancy for the veritable reins of government
if dr marjoribanks had entertained any positive apprehensions that his dinners would be spoiled in consequence his amusement would have come to an abrupt conclusion but he trusted entirely in nancy and a little in lucilla and suffered his long upperlip to relax at the thought without much fear
her father had not returned from the labours of his long day when lucilla arrived but he made his last visits on foot in order to be able to send the brougham for her which was a great thing for the doctor to do
there was indeed a mutual respect between the two who were not necessary to each other's comfort it is true as such near relations sometimes are but who at the same time except on the sole occasion of mrs marjoribanks's death had never misunderstood each other as sometimes happens
this time miss marjoribanks was rather pleased on the whole that the doctor did not come to meet her
at other times she had been a visitor now she had come into her kingdom and had no desire to be received like a guest
a sense of coming home warmer than she remembered to have felt before came into lucilla's active mind as she stepped into the brougham
not that the words bore any special tender meaning notwithstanding that it was the desire of her heart well known to all her friends to live henceforward as a comfort to dear papa but that now at last she was coming into her kingdom and entering the domain in which she intended her will to be law
after living for a year with friends whose arrangements much inferior to those which she could have made had she had the power she had to acquiesce in and whose domestic economy could only be criticised up to a certain point it was naturally a pleasure to miss marjoribanks to feel that now at length she was emancipated and at liberty to exercise her faculty
there were times during the past year when lucilla had with difficulty restrained herself from snatching the reins out of the hands of her hosts and showing them how to manage
but impatient as she was she had to restrain herself and make the best of it
now all that bondage was over
she felt like a young king entering in secret a capital which awaits him with acclamations
before she presented herself to the rejoicing public there were arrangements to be made and things to be done and miss marjoribanks gave a rapid glance at the shops in george street as she drove past and decided which of them she meant to honour with her patronage
when she entered the garden it was with the same rapid glance of reorganising genius that she cast her eyes around it and still more decided was the look with which she regarded her own room where she was guided by the new housemaid who did not know miss lucilla
nancy who knew no better being like most gifted persons a woman of one idea had established her young mistress in the little chamber which had been lucilla's when she was a child but miss marjoribanks who had no sentimental notions about white dimity shook her head at the frigid little apartment where however she was not at all sorry to be placed at present for if dr marjoribanks had been a man of the prevenant class disposed to make all the preparations possible for his daughter and arrange elegant surprises for her he would have thoroughly disgusted lucilla who was bent on making all the necessary improvements in her own person
when she went down to the drawingroom to await her father miss marjoribanks's look of disapprobation was mingled with so much satisfaction and content in herself that it was pleasant to behold
she shook her head and shrugged her shoulders as she paused in the centre of the large faded room where there was no light but that of the fire which burned brightly and kept up a lively play of glimmer and shadow in the tall glass over the fireplace and even twinkled dimly in the three long windows where the curtains hung stiff and solemn in their daylight form
it was not an uncomfortable sort of big dull faded respectable drawingroom and if there had been a family in it with recollections attached to every old ottoman and easychair no doubt it would have been charming but it was only a waste and howling wilderness to lucilla
when she had walked from one end to the other and verified all the plans she had already long ago conceived for the embellishment of this inner court and centre of her kingdom lucilla walked with her unhesitating step to the fire and took a match and lighted all the candles in the large oldfashioned candlesticks which had been flickering in grotesque shadows all over the roof
this proceeding threw a flood of light on the subject of her considerations and gave miss marjoribanks an idea in passing about the best mode of lighting which she afterwards acted upon with great success
she was standing in this flood of light regarding everything around her with the eye of an enlightened critic and reformer when dr marjoribanks came in
perhaps there arose in the soul of the doctor a momentary thought that the startling amount of clairage which he witnessed was scarcely necessary for it is certain that he gave a momentary glance at the candles as he went up to greet his daughter but he was far too wellbred a man to suggest such an idea at the moment
on the contrary he kissed her with a sentiment of real pleasure and owned to himself that if she was not a fool and could keep to her own department it might be rather agreeable on the whole to have a woman in the house
the sentiment was not enthusiastic and neither were the words of his salutation well lucilla so this is you
said the moderate and unexcited father
yes papa it is me said miss marjoribanks and very glad to get home and so the two sat down and discussed the journeywhether she had been cold and what state the railway was intill the doctor bethought himself that he had to prepare for dinner
nancy is always very punctual and i am sure you are hungry he said so i'll go upstairs with your permission lucilla and change my coat and with this the actual arrival terminated and the new reign began
but it was only next morning that the young sovereign gave any intimation of her future policy
she had naturally a great deal to tell that first night and though it was exclusively herself and her own adventures and achievements which miss marjoribanks related the occasion of her return made that sufficiently natural and the doctor was not altogether superior to the natural prejudice which makes a man interested even when they are not in themselves particularly interesting in the doings of his children
she succeeded in doing what is certainly one of the first duties of a womanshe amused her father
he followed her to the drawingroom for a marvel and took a cup of tea though it was against his principles and on the whole lucilla had the satisfaction of feeling that she had made a conquest of the doctor which of course was the grand and most essential preliminary
in the little interval which he spent over his claret miss marjoribanks had succeeded in effecting another fundamental duty of womanshe had as she herself expressed it harmonised the rooms by the simple method of rearranging half the chairs and covering the tables with trifles of her owna proceeding which converted the apartment from an abstract english drawingroom of the old school into miss marjoribanks's drawingroom an individual spot of ground revealing something of the character of its mistress
the doctor himself was so moved by this that he looked vaguely round when he came in as if a little doubtful where he wasbut that might only be the effect of the sparkling mass of candles on the mantelpiece which he was too wellbred to remark upon the first night
but it was only in the morning that lucilla unfolded her standard
she was down to breakfast ready to pour out the coffee before the doctor had left his room
he found her to his intense amazement seated at the foot of the table in the place which he usually occupied himself before the urn and the coffeepot
dr marjoribanks hesitated for one momentous instant stricken dumb by this unparalleled audacity but so great was the effect of his daughter's courage and steadiness that after that moment of fate he accepted the seat by the side where everything was arranged for him and to which lucilla invited him sweetly though not without a touch of mental perturbation
the moment he had seated himself the doctor's eyes were opened to the importance of the step he had taken
i am afraid i have taken your seat papa said miss marjoribanks with ingenuous sweetness
but then i should have had to move the urn and all the things and i thought you would not mind
the doctor said nothing but humph
and even that in an undertone but he became aware all the same that he had abdicated without knowing it and that the reins of state had been smilingly withdrawn from his unconscious hands
when nancy made her appearance the fact became still more apparent though still in the sweetest way
it is so dreadful to think papa should have been bothered with all these things so long said miss marjoribanks
after this i am sure you and i nancy can arrange it all without giving him the trouble
perhaps this morning papa as i am a stranger you will say if there is anything you would like and then i shall have time to talk it all over with nancy and find out what is bestand lucilla smiled so sweetly upon her two amazed subjects that the humour of the situation caught the fancy of the doctor who had a keen perception of the ridiculous
he laughed out much to nancy's consternation who was standing by in openeyed dismay
very well lucilla he said you shall try what you can do
i daresay nancy will be glad to have me back again before long but in the meantime i am quite content that you should try and he went off laughing to his brougham but came back again before lucilla could take nancy in hand who was an antagonist more formidable
i forgot to tell you said the doctor that tom marjoribanks is coming on circuit and that i have asked him to stay here as a matter of course
i suppose he'll arrive tomorrow
goodbye till the evening
this though dr marjoribanks did not in the least intend it struck lucilla like a parthian arrow and brought her down for the moment
tom marjoribanks
she ejaculated in a kind of horror
of all people in the world and at this moment
but when she saw the open eyes and rising colour of nancy the young dictator recovered herselffor a conqueror in the first moment of his victory has need to be wary
she called nancy to her in her most affectionate tones as she finished her breakfast
i sent papa away said miss marjoribanks because i wanted to have a good talk with you nancy
i want to tell you my object in life
it is to be a comfort to papa
ever since poor mamma died that is what i have been thinking of and now i have come home and i have made up my mind that he is not to be troubled about anything
i know what a good faithful valuable woman you are i assure you
you need not think me a foolish girl who is not able to appreciate you
the dinner was charming last night nancy said lucilla with much feeling and i never saw anything more beautifully cooked than papa's cutlets today
miss lucilla i may say as i am very glad i have pleased you said nancy who was not quite conquered as yet
she stood very stiffly upright by the table and maintained her integrity
master is particular i don't deny continued the prime minister who felt herself dethroned
i've always done my best to go in with his little fancies and i don't mean to say as it isn't right and natural as you should be the missis
but i ain't used to have ado with ladies and that's the truth
ladies is stingy in amany things as is the soul of a good dinner to them as knows
i may be valleyable or not it ain't for me to say but i'm not one as can always be kept to a set figger in my gravybeef and my bacon and them sorts of things
as for the butter i don't know as i could give nobody an idea
i ain't one as likes changes but i can't abide to be kept to a set figger and that's the chief thing miss lucilla as i've got to say
and quite reasonable too said miss marjoribanks you and i will work perfectly well together nancy
i am sure we have both the same meaning and i hope you don't think i am less concerned about dear papa than about the gravybeef
he must have been very desolate with no one to talk to though he has been so good and kind and selfsacrificing in leaving me to get every advantage but i mean to make it up to him now i've come home
yes miss said nancy somewhat mystified not but what master has had his little parties now and again to cheer him up a bit and i make bold to say miss as i have heard compliments which it was thomas that brought 'em downstairs as might go nigh to turn a body's head if it was vanity as i was thinking of but i ain't one as thinks of anything but the comfort of the family said nancy yielding in spite of herself to follow the leadings of the higher will in presence of which she found herself and i'm always one as does my best miss lucilla if i ain't worried nor kept to a set figger with my gravybeef
i have heard of papa's dinners said lucilla graciously and i don't mean to let down your reputation nancy
now we are two women to manage everything we ought to do still better
i have two or three things in my head that i will tell you after but in the meantime i want you to know that the object of my life is to be a comfort to poor papa and now let us think what we had better have for dinner said the new sovereign
nancy was so totally unprepared for this manner of dethronement that she gave in like her master
she followed miss marjoribanks humbly into those details in which lucilla speedily proved herself a woman of original mind and powers quite equal to her undertaking
the doctor's formidable housekeeper conducted her young mistress downstairs afterwards and showed her everything with the meekness of a saint
lucilla had won a second victory still more exhilarating and satisfactory than the first for to be sure it is no great credit to a woman of nineteen to make a man of any age throw down his arms but to conquer a woman is a different matter and lucilla was thoroughly sensible of the difference
now indeed she could feel with a sense of reality that her foundations were laid
miss marjoribanks had enough of occupation for that day and for many days
but her mind was a little distracted by her father's parting intelligence and she had besides a natural desire to view the country she had come to conquer
when she had made a careful supervision of the house and shifted her own quarters into the pleasantest of the two best bedrooms and concluded that the little bare dimity chamber she had occupied the previous night was quite good enough for tom marjoribanks lucilla put on her hat and went out to make a little reconnaissance
she walked down to the spot where st roque's now stands on her own side of grange lane and up on the other side into george street surveying all the capabilities of the place with a rapid but penetrating glance
dr marjoribanks's house could not have been better placed as a strategic position commanding as it did all grange lane of which it was so to speak the key and yet affording a base of communication with the profaner public which miss marjoribanks was wise enough to know a leader of society should never ignore completely for indeed one of the great advantages of that brilliant position is that it gives a woman a right to be arbitrary and to select her materials according to her judgment
it was more from a disinclination to repeat herself than any other motive that lucilla when she had concluded this preliminary survey went up into grove street meaning to return home that way
at that hour in the morning the sun was shining on the little gardens on the north side of the street which was the plebeian side and as it was the end of october and by no means warm lucilla was glad to cross over and continue her walk by the side of those little enclosures where the straggling chrysanthemums propped each other up and the cheerful michaelmas daisies made the best of it in the sunshine that remained to them
miss marjoribanks had nearly reached salem chapel which pushed itself forward amid the cosy little line of houses pondering in her mind the unexpected hindrance which was about to be placed in her triumphant path in the shape of tom marjoribanks when that singular piece of good fortune occurred to her which had so much effect upon her career in carlingford
such happy accidents rarely happen except to great generals or heroes of romance and it would have been perhaps a presumption on the part of lucilla to place herself conspicuously in either of these categories
the fact is however that at this eventful moment she was walking along under the shade of her pretty parasol not expecting anything but absorbed in many thoughts and a little cast down in her expectations of success by a consciousness that this unlucky cousin would insist upon making love to her and perhaps even as she herself expressed it saying the words which it had taken all her skill to prevent him from saying before
not that we would have any one believe that lovemaking in the abstract was disagreeable to miss marjoribanks but she was only nineteen well off and goodlooking and with plenty of time for all that and at the present moment she had other matters of more importance in hand
it was while occupied with these reflections and within three doors of salem chapel in front of a little garden where a great deal of mignonette had run to seed and where the michaelmas daisies had taken full possession that lucilla was roused suddenly out of her musings
the surprise was so great that she stopped short and stood still before the house in the extremity of her astonishment and delight
who could it be that possessed that voice which miss marjoribanks felt by instinct was the very one thing wantinga round full delicious contralto precisely adapted to supplement without supplanting her own highpitched and muchcultivated organ
she stopped short before the door and made a rapid observation even in the first moment of her surprise
the house was not exactly like the other humble houses in grove street
two little blank squares hung in the centre of each of the lower windows revealed to lucilla's educated eye the existence of so much feeling for art as can be satisfied with a transparent porcelain version of a famous madonna and she could even catch a glimpse through the curtains of the best roomwhich contrary to the wont of humble gentility in carlingford were well drawn back and allowed the light to enter fullyof the glimmer of gilt pictureframes
and in the little garden in front half buried among the mignonette were some remains of plastercasts originally placed there for ornament but long since cast down by rain and neglect
lucilla made her observations with the promptitude of an accomplished warrior and before the second bar of the melody indoors was finished had knocked very energetically
is miss lake at home
she asked with confidence of the little maidservant who opened the door to her
and it was thus that lucilla made her first bold step out of the limits of grange lane for the good of society and secured at once several important personal advantages and the great charm of those thursday evenings which made so entire a revolution in the taste and ideas of carlingford
chapter v   miss marjoribanks did not leave the contralto any time to recover from her surprise she went up to her direct where she stood with her song arrested on her lips as she had risen hastily from the piano
is it rose
said lucilla going forward with the most eager cordiality and holding out both her hands though to be sure she knew very well it was not rose who was about half the height of the singer and was known to everybody in mount pleasant to be utterly innocent of a voice
no said miss lake who was much astonished and startled and offended as was unfortunately rather her custom
she was a young woman without any of those instincts of politeness which make some people pleasant in spite of themselves and she added nothing to soften this abrupt negative but drew her hands away from the stranger and stood bolt upright looking at her with a burning blush caused by temper much more than by embarrassment on her face
then said lucilla dropping lightly into the most comfortable chair she could get sight of in the bare little parlour it is barbaraand that is a great deal better rose is a good little thing butshe is different you know
it is so odd you should not remember me i thought everybody knew me in carlingford
you know i have been a long time away and now i have come home for good
your voice is just the very thing to go with mine was it not a lucky thing that i should have passed just at the right moment
i don't know how it is but somehow these lucky chances always happen to me
i am lucilla marjoribanks you know
indeed
said barbara who had not the least intention of being civil i did not recognise you in the least
yes i remember you were always shortsighted a little said miss marjoribanks calmly
i should so like if we could try a duet
i have been having lessons in italy you know and i am sure i could give you a few hints
i always like when i can to be of use
tell me what songs you have that we could sing together
you know my dear it is not as if i was asking you for mere amusement to myself my grand object in life is to be a comfort to papa  do you mean dr marjoribanks
said the uncivil barbara
i am sure he does not care in the least for music
i think you must be making a mistake  oh no said lucilla i never make mistakes
i don't mean to sing to him you know but you are just the very person i wanted
as for the ridiculous idea some people have that nobody can be called on who does not live in grange lane i assure you i mean to make an end of that
of course i cannot commence just all in a moment
but it would always be an advantage to practise a little together
i like to know exactly how far one can calculate upon everybody then one can tell without fear of breaking down just what one may venture to do
i don't understand in the least said barbara whose pride was up in arms
perhaps you think i am a professional singer
my dear a professional singer spoils everything said miss marjoribanks it changes the character of an evening altogether
there are so few people who understand that
when you have professional singers you have to give yourself up to music and that is not my view in the least
my great aim as all my friends are aware is to be a comfort to dear papa
i wish you would not talk in riddles said lucilla's amazed and indignant companion in her round rich contralto
i suppose you really are miss marjoribanks
i have always heard that miss marjoribanks was a little  there
said lucilla triumphantly really it is almost like a recitativo to hear you speak
i am so glad
what have you got there
oh to be sure it's that duet out of the trovatore
do let us try it there is nobody here and everything is so convenientand you know it would never do to risk a breakdown
will you play the accompaniment or shall i
said miss marjoribanks taking off her gloves
as for the drawingmaster's daughter she stood aghast lost in such sudden bewilderment and perplexity that she could find no words to reply
she was not in the least amiable or yielding by nature but lucilla took it so much as a matter of course that barbara could not find a word to say and before she could be sure that it was real miss marjoribanks had seated herself at the piano
barbara was so obstinate that she would not sing the first part which ought to have been hers but she was not clever enough for her antagonist
lucilla sang her part by herself gallantly and when it came to barbara's turn the second time miss marjoribanks essayed the second in a false voice which drove the contralto off her guard and then the magnificent volume of sound flowed forth grand enough to have filled lucilla with envy if she had not been sustained by that sublime confidence in herself which is the first necessity to a woman with a mission
she paused a moment in the accompaniment to clap her hands after that strophe was accomplished and then resumed with energy
for to be sure she knew by instinct what sort of clay the people were made of by whom she had to work and gave them their reward with that liberality and discrimination which is the glory of enlightened despotism
miss marjoribanks was naturally elated when she had performed this important and successful tour
she got up from the piano and closed it in her open imperial way
i do not want to tire you you know she said that will do for today
i told you your voice was the very thing to go with mine
give my love to rose when she comes in but don't bring her with you when you come to me
she is a good little thingbut then she is different you know said the bland lucilla and she held out her hand to her captive graciously and gathered up her parasol which she had left on her chair
barbara lake let her visitor go after this with a sense that she had fallen asleep and had dreamt it all but after all there was something in the visit which was not disagreeable when she came to think it over
the drawingmaster was poor and he had a quantity of children as was natural and barbara had never forgiven her mother for dying just at the moment when she had a chance of seeing a little of what she called the world
at that time mr lake and his portfolio of drawings were asked out frequently to tea and when he had pupils in the family some kind people asked him to bring one of his daughters with himso that barbara who was ambitious had beheld herself for a month or two almost on the threshold of grange lane
and it was at this moment of all others just at the same time as mrs marjoribanks finished her pale career that poor mrs lake thought fit to die to the injury of her daughter's prospects and the destruction of her hopes
naturally barbara had never quite forgiven that injury
it was this sense of having been illused which made her so resolute about sending rose to mount pleasant though the poor little girl did not in the least want to go and was very happy helping her papa at the school of design
but barbara saw no reason why rose should be happy while she herself had to resign her inclinations and look after a set of odious children
to be sure it was a little hard upon a young woman of a proper ambition who knew she was handsome to fall back into housekeeping and consent to remain unseen and unheard for barbara was also aware that she had a remarkable voice
in these circumstances it may be imagined that after the first movement of a passionate temper was over when she had taken breath and had time to consider this sudden and extraordinary visit a glimmer of hope and interest penetrated into the bosom of the gloomy girl
she was two years older than miss marjoribanks and as different in style as she was in voice
she was not stout as yet though it is the nature of a contralto to be stout but she was tall with all due opportunity for that development which might come later
and then barbara possessed a kind of beauty the beauty of a passionate and somewhat sullen brunette dark and glowing with straight black eyebrows very dark and very straight which gave oddly enough a suggestion of oblique vision to her eyes but her eyes were not in the least oblique and looked at you straight from under that black line of shadow with no doubtful expression
she was shy in a kind of way as was natural to a young woman who had never seen any society and felt herself on the whole injured and unappreciated
but no two things could be more different than this shyness which made barbara look you straight in the face with a kind of scared defiance and the sweet shyness that pleaded for kind treatment in the soft eyes of little rose who was plain and had the oddest longing to make people comfortable and please them in her way which to be sure was not always successful
barbara sat down on the stool before the piano which miss marjoribanks had been so obliging as to close and thought it all over with growing excitement
no doubt it was a little puzzling to make out how the discovery of a fine contralto and the possibility of getting up unlimited duets could further lucilla in the great aim of her life which was to be a comfort to her dear papa
but barbara was like a young soldier of fortune ready to take a great deal for granted and swallow much that was mysterious in the programme of the adventurous general who might lead her on to glory
in half an hour her dreams had gone so far that she saw herself receiving in miss marjoribanks's drawingroom the homage not only of grange lane but even of the county families who would be attracted by rumours of her wonderful performance and barbara was to her own consciousness walking up the middle aisle of carlingford church in a veil of real brussels before little mr lake came in hungry and goodtempered from his round
to be sure she had not concluded who was to be the bridegroom but that was one of those matters of detail which could not be precisely concluded on till the time
such was the immediate result so far as this secondary personage was concerned of lucilla's masterly impromptu and it is needless to say that the accomplished warrior who had her wits always about her and had made while engaged in a simple reconnaissance so brilliant and successful a capture withdrew from the scene still more entirely satisfied with herself
nothing indeed could have come more opportunely for lucilla who possessed in perfection that faculty of throwing herself into the future and anticipating the difficulties of a position which is so valuable to all who aspire to be leaders of mankind
with a prudence which dr marjoribanks himself would have acknowledged to be remarkable in a person of her age and sex lucilla had already foreseen that to amuse her guests entirely in her own person would be at once impracticable and bad style
the first objection might have been got over for miss marjoribanks had a soul above the ordinary limits of possibility but the second unanswerable
this discovery however satisfied all the necessities of the position
lucilla who was liberal as genius ought always to be was perfectly willing that all the young ladies in carlingford should sing their little songs while she was entertaining her guests and then at the right moment when her ruling mind saw it was necessary would occur the duetthe one duet which would be the great feature of the evening
thus it will be seen that another quality of the highest order developed itself during miss marjoribanks's deliberations for to tell the truth she set a good deal of store by her voice and had been used to applause and had tasted the sweetness of individual success
this however she was willing to sacrifice for the enhanced and magnificent effect which she felt could be produced by the combination of the two voices and the sacrifice was one which a weaker woman would have been incapable of making
she went home past salem chapel by the little lane which makes a line of communication between the end of grove street and the beginning of grange lane with a sentiment of satisfaction worthy the greatness of her mission
dr marjoribanks never came home to lunch and indeed had a contempt for that feminine indulgence which to be sure might be accounted for by the fact that about that time in the day the doctor very often found himself to be passing close by one or other of the houses in the neighbourhood which had a reputation for good sherry or madeira such as exists no more
lucilla accordingly had her lunch alone served to her with respectful care by nancy who was still under the impression of the interview of the morning and it occurred to miss marjoribanks as she sat at table alone that this was an opportunity too valuable to be left unimproved for to be sure there are few things more pleasant than a little impromptu luncheonparty where everybody comes without being expected fresh from the outside world and ready to tell all that is going on though on the other hand it was a little doubtful how it might work in carlingford where the men had generally something to do and where the married ladies took their luncheon when the children had their dinner and presided at the nursery meal
and as for a party of young ladies even supposing they had the courage to come with no more solid admixture of the more important members of society lucilla to tell the truth had no particular taste for that
miss marjoribanks reflected as she ateand indeed thanks to her perfect health and her agreeable morning walk lucilla had a very pretty appetite and enjoyed her meal in a way that would have been most satisfactory to her many friendsthat it must be by way of making his visit which was aggravating under all circumstances more aggravating still that tom marjoribanks had decided to come now of all times in the world
if he had waited till things were organised he might have been of a little use lucilla said to herself for at least he could have brought some of the men that come on circuit and that would have made a little novelty but of course just now it would never do to make a rush at people and invite them all at once
after a moment's consideration however
miss marjoribanks with her usual candour reflected that it was not in tom marjoribanks's power to change the time of the carlingford assizes and that accordingly he was not to be blamed in this particular at least
of course it is not his fault she added to herself but it is astonishing how things happen with some men always at the wrong moment and it is so like tom
these reflections were interrupted by the arrival of visitors whom miss marjoribanks received with her usual grace
the first was old mrs chiley who kissed lucilla and wanted to know how she had enjoyed herself on the continent and if she had brought many pretty things home
my dear you have grown ever so much since the last time i saw you the old lady said in her grandmotherly way and stout with it which is such a comfort with a tall girl and then your poor dear mamma was so delicate
i have always been a little anxious about you on that account lucilla and i am so glad my dear to see you looking so strong
dear mrs chiley said miss marjoribanks who perhaps in her heart was not quite so gratified by this compliment as the old lady intended the great aim of my life is to be a comfort to dear papa
mrs chiley was very much moved by this filial piety and she told lucilla that story about the colonel's niece susan who was such a good daughter and had refused three excellent offers to devote herself to her father and mother with which the public in grange lane were tolerably acquainted
and one of them was a baronet my dear said mrs chiley
miss marjoribanks did not make any decided response for she felt that it would be dangerous to commit herself to such a height of selfabnegation as that but the old lady was quite pleased to hear of her travels and adventures instead and stayed so long that mrs centum and mrs woodburn who happened to arrive at the same moment found her still there
mrs chiley was a little afraid of mrs woodburn and she took her leave hastily with another kiss and lucilla found herself face to face with the only two women who could attempt a rival enterprise to her own in carlingford
as for mrs woodburn she had settled herself in an easychair by the fire and was fully prepared to take notes
to be sure lucilla was the very person to fall victim to her arts for that confidence in herself which in one point of view gave grandeur to the character of miss marjoribanks gave her also a certain navet and openness which the most simple rustic could not have surpassed
i am sure by her face she has been telling you about my niece susan said the mimic assuming mrs chiley's tone and almost her appearance for the moment and that one of them was a baronet my dear
i always know from her looks what she has been saying and 'the colonel was much as usual but suffering a little from the cold as he always does in this climate'
she must be a good soul for she always has her favourite little speeches written in her face
i am sure i don't know said miss marjoribanks who felt it was her duty to make an example there has always been one thing remarked of me all my life that i never have had a great sense of humour
i know it is singular but when one has a defect it is always so much better to confess it
i always get on very well with anything else but i never had any sense of humour you know and i am very fond of mrs chiley
she has always had a fancy for me from the time i was born and she has such nice manners
but then it is so odd i should have no sense of humour said lucilla addressing herself to mrs centum who was sitting on the sofa by her
don't you think it is very odd
i am sure it is very nice said mrs centum
i hate people that laugh at everything
i don't see much to laugh at myself i am sure in this distracting world any one who has a lot of children and servants like me to look after finds very little to laugh at
and she seized the opportunity to enter upon domestic circumstances
mrs woodburn did not answer a word
she made a most dashing murderous sketch of lucilla but that did the future ruler of carlingford very little harm and then by the evening it was known through all grange lane that miss marjoribanks had snubbed the caricaturist who kept all the good people in terror of their lives
snubbed her absolutely and took the words out of her very mouth was the report that flew through grange lane and it may be imagined how lucilla's prestige rose in consequence and how much people began to expect of miss marjoribanks who had performed such a feat almost on the first day of her return home
chapter vi   tom marjoribanks arrived that night according to the doctor's expectation
he arrived with that curious want of adaptation to the circumstances which characterised the young man at an hour which put nancy entirely out and upset the equanimity of the kitchen for twentyfour hours at least
he came if any one can conceive of such an instance of carelessness by the nine o'clock train just as they had finished putting to rights downstairs
after this miss marjoribanks's conclusion that the fact of the carlingford assizes occurring a day or two after her arrival when as yet she was not fully prepared to take advantage of them was so like tom may be partially understood
and of course he was furiously hungry and could have managed perfectly to be in time for dinner if he had not missed the train at didcot junction by some wonderful blunder of the railway people which never could have occurred but for his unlucky presence among the passengers
lucilla took thomas apart and sent him downstairs with the most conciliatory message
tell nancy not to put herself about but to send up something coldthe cold pie or anything she can find handy
tell her i am so vexed but it is just like mr tom and he never knows what he is eating said miss marjoribanks
as for nancy this sweetness did not subdue her in the least
she said i'll thank miss lucilla to mind her own business
the cold pie is for master's breakfast
i ain't such a goose as not to know what to send upstairs and that tummas can tell her if he likes
in the meantime the doctor was in the drawingroom much against his will with the two young people spinning about the room and looking at lucilla's books and knickknacks on the tables by way of covering his impatience
he wanted to carry off tom who was rather a favourite to his own den downstairs where the young man's supper was to be served but at the same time dr marjoribanks could not deny that lucilla had a right to the greetings and homage of her cousin
he could not help thinking on the whole as he looked at the two what a much more sensible arrangement it would have been if he had had the boy instead of his sister who had been a widow for ever so long and no doubt had spoiled her son as women always do and then lucilla might have passed under the sway of mrs marjoribanks who no doubt would have known how to manage her
thus the doctor mused with that sense of mild amazement at the blunders of providence which so many people experience and without any idea that mrs marjoribanks would have found a task a great deal beyond her powers in the management of lucilla
as for tom he was horribly hungry having found as was to be expected no possible means of lunching at didcot but at the same time he was exhilarated by lucilla's smile and delighted to think of having a week at least to spend in her society
i don't think i ever saw you looking so well he was saying and you know my opinion generally on that subject
to which lucilla responded in a way to wither all the germs of sentiment in the bud
what subject
she said my looks
i am sure they can't be interesting to you
you are as hungry as ever you can be and i can see it in your eyes
papa he is famishing and i don't think he can contain himself any longer
do take him downstairs and let him have something to eat
for myself lucilla continued in a lower tone it is my duty that keeps me up
you know it has always been the object of my life to be a comfort to papa
come along tom said the doctor
don't waste your time philandering when your supper is ready
and dr marjoribanks led the way downstairs leaving tom who followed him in a state of great curiosity to know what secret oppression it might be under which his cousin was supported by her duty
naturally his thoughts reverted to a possible rivalsome one whom the sensible doctor would have nothing to say to and his very ears grew red with excitement at this idea
but notwithstanding he ate a very satisfactory meal in the library where he had to answer all sorts of questions
tom had his tray at the end of the table and the doctor who had according to his hospitable oldfashioned habit taken a glass of claret to keep him company sat in his easychair between the fire and the table and sipped his wine and admired its colour and purity in the light and watched with satisfaction the excellent meal his nephew was making
he asked him all about his prospects and what he was doing which tom replied to with the frankest confidence
he was not very fond of work nor were his abilities anything out of the common but at the present moment tom saw no reason why he should not gain the woolsack in time and dr marjoribanks gave something like a sigh as he listened and wondered much what providence could be thinking of not to give him the boy
lucilla meantime was very much occupied upstairs
she had the new housemaid up nominally to give her instructions about mr tom's room but really to take the covers off the chairs and see how they looked when the room was lighted up but the progress of decay had gone too far to stand that trial
after all the chintz though none of the freshest was the best
when the gentlemen came upstairs which tom to the doctor's disgust insisted on doing lucilla was found in the act of pacing the roompacing not in the sentimental sense of making a little promenade up and down but in the homely practical signification with a view of measuring that she might form an idea how much carpet was required
lucilla was tall enough to go through this process without any great drawback in point of gracethe long step giving rather a tragedyqueen effect to her handsome but substantial person and long sweeping dress
she stopped short however when she saw them and withdrew to the sofa on which she had established her throne and there was a little air of conscious pathos on her face as she sat down which impressed her companions
as for tom he instinctively felt that it must have something to do with that mystery under which lucilla was supported by her duty and the irrelevant young man conceived immediately a violent desire to knock the fellow down whereas there was no fellow at all in the case unless it might be mr holden the upholsterer whose visits miss marjoribanks would have received with greater enthusiasm at this moment than those of the most eligible eldest son in england
and then she gave a little pathetic sigh
what were you doing lucilla
said her fatherrehearsing lady macbeth i suppose
at least you looked exactly like it when we came into the room
no papa said lucilla sweetly i was only measuring to see how much carpet we should want and that you know and tom's coming made me think of old times
you are so much downstairs in the library that you don't feel it but a lady has to spend her life in the drawingroomand then i always was so domestic
it does not matter what is outside i always find my pleasure at home
i cannot help if it has a little effect on my spirits now and then said miss marjoribanks looking down upon her handkerchief to be always surrounded with things that have such associations  what associations
said the amazed doctor
to be sure he had forgotten his wife but it was four years ago and he had got used to her absence from her favourite sofa and on the whole in that particular had acquiesced in the arrangements of providence
really lucilla i don't know what you mean
no papa said miss marjoribanks with resignation
i know you don't and that is what makes it so sad
but talking of new carpets you know i had such an adventure today that i must tell youquite one of my adventuresthe very luckiest thing
it happened when i was out walking i heard a voice out of a house in grove street just the very thing to go with my voice
that is not a thing that happens every day said lucilla for all the masters have always told me that my voice was something quite by itself
when i heard it though it was in grove street and all the people about i could have danced for joy
it was a man's voice i suppose suggested tom marjoribanks in gloomy tones and the doctor added in his cynical way  it's a wonderful advantage to be so pleased about trifles
what number was it
for my part i have not many patients in grove street said dr marjoribanks
i would find a voice to suit you in another quarter if i were you
dear papa it's such a pity that you don't understand said lucilla compassionately
it turned out to be barbara lake for of course i went in directly and found out
i never heard a voice that went so well with mine
if miss marjoribanks did not go into raptures over the contralto on its own merits it was not from any jealousy of which indeed she was incapable but simply because its adaptation to her own seemed to her by far its most interesting quality and indeed almost the sole claim it had to consideration from the world
barbara lake
said the doctor
there's something in that
if you can do her any good or get her teaching or anythingi have a regard for poor lake poor little fellow
he's kept up wonderfully since his wife died and nobody expected it of him dr marjoribanks continued with a momentary dreary recollection of the time when the poor woman took farewell of her children which indeed was the next day after that on which his own wife who had nobody in particular to take farewell of faded out of her useless life
yes said lucilla i mean her to come here and sing with me but then one needs to organise a little first
i am nineteenhow long is it since you were married papa
twoandtwenty years said the doctor abruptly
he did not observe the strangeness of the question because he had been thinking for the moment of his wife and perhaps his face was a trifle graver than usual though neither of his young companions thought of remarking it
to be sure he was not a young man even when he married but on the whole perhaps something more than this perfect comfort and respectability and those nice little dinners had seemed to shine on his horizon when he brought home his incapable bride
twoandtwenty years
exclaimed lucilla
i don't mind talking before tom for he is one of the family
the things are all the same as they were when mamma came home though i am sure nobody would believe it
i think it is going against providence for my part
nothing was ever intended to last so long except the things the jews poor souls
wore in the desert perhaps
papa if you have no objection i should like to choose the colours myself
there is a great deal in choosing colours that go well with one's complexion
people think of that for their dresses but not for their rooms which are of so much more importance
i should have liked blue but blue gets so soon tawdry
i think said miss marjoribanks rising and looking at herself seriously in the glass that i have enough complexion at present to venture upon a pale spring green
this little calculation which a timid young woman would have taken care to do by herself lucilla did publicly with her usual discrimination
the doctor who had looked a little grim at first could not but laugh when he saw the sober look of care and thought with which miss marjoribanks examined her capabilities in the glass
it was not so much the action itself that amused her father as the consummate ability of the young revolutionary
dr marjoribanks was scotch and had a respect for talent in every development as is natural to his nation
he did not even give his daughter that credit for sincerity which she deserved but set it all to the score of her genius which was complimentary certainly in one point of view but the fact was that lucilla was perfectly sincere and that she did what was natural to her under guidance of her genius so as always to be in good fortune just as tom marjoribanks under the guidance of his brought discredit even upon those eternal ordinances of english government which fixed the time of the carlingford assizes
lucilla was quite in earnest in thinking that the colour of the drawingroom was an important matter and that a woman of sense had very good reason for suiting it to her complexionan idea which accordingly she proceeded to develop and explain
for one can change one's dress said miss marjoribanks as often as one likesat least as often you know as one has dresses to change but the furniture remains the same
i am always a perfect guy whatever i wear when i sit against a red curtain
you men say that a woman always knows when she's goodlooking but i am happy to say i know when i look a guy
what i mean is a delicate pale green papa
for my part i think it wears just as well as any other colour and all the painters say it is the very thing for pictures
the carpet of course would be a darker shade and as for the chairs it is not at all necessary to keep to one colour
both red and violet go beautifully with green you know
i am sure mr holden and i could settle all about it without giving you any trouble
who told you lucilla said the doctor that i meant to refurnish the house
he was even a little angry at her boldness but at the same time he was so much amused and pleased in his heart to have so clever a daughter that all the tones that could produce terror were softened out of his voice
i never heard that was a sort of thing a man had to do for his daughter said dr marjoribanks and i would like to know what i should do with all that finery when you get marriedas i suppose you will by and byand leave me alone in the house
ah that is the important question said tom
as usual it was tom's luck but then when there did happen to be a moment when he ought to be silent the unfortunate fellow could not help but speak
perhaps i may marry some time said miss marjoribanks with composure it would be foolish you know to make any engagements but that will depend greatly upon how you behave and how carlingford behaves papa
i give myself ten years here if you should be very good
by twentynine i shall be going off a little and perhaps it may be tiring for anything i can tell
ten years is a long time and naturally in the meantime i want to look as well as possible
stop a minute i forgot to put down the number of paces for the length
tom please to do it over again for me of course your steps are a great deal longer than mine
tom is tired said the doctor and there are no new carpets coming out of my pockets
besides he's going to bed and i'm going downstairs to the library
we may as well bid you goodnight
these words however were addressed to deaf ears
tom as was natural had started immediately to obey lucilla as he was in duty bound and the old doctor looked on with a little amazement and a little amusement recognising with something of the surprise which that discovery always gives to fathers and mothers that his visitor cared twenty times more for what lucilla said than for anything that his superior wisdom could suggest
he would have gone off and left them as a couple of young fools if it had not occurred to him all at once that since this sort of thing had begun the last person in the world that he would choose to see dancing attendance on his daughter was tom marjoribanks
oddly enough though he had just been finding fault with providence for not giving him a son instead of a daughter he was not at all delighted nor grateful when providence put before him this simple method of providing himself with the son he wanted
he took a great deal too much interest in tom marjoribanks to let him do anything so foolish and as for lucilla the idea that after all her accomplishments and her expensive education and her year on the continent she should marry a man who had nothing disgusted the doctor
he kept his seat accordingly though he was horribly bored by the drawingroom and its claims and wanted very much to return to the library and get into his slippers and his dressinggown
it was rather a pretty picture on the whole which he was regarding
lucilla perhaps with a view to this discussion had put on green ribbons on the white dress which she always wore in the evening and her tawny curls and fresh complexion carried off triumphantly that difficult colour
perhaps a critical observer might have said that her figure was a little too developed and substantial for these vestal robes but then miss marjoribanks was young and could bear it
she was standing by not far from the fire on the other side from the doctor looking on anxiously while tom measured the room with his long steps
i never said you were to stride said lucilla take moderate steps and don't be so silly
i was doing it myself famously if you had not come in and interrupted me
it is frightful to belong to a family where the men are so stupid said miss marjoribanks with a sigh of real distress for to be sure the unlucky tom immediately bethought himself to take small steps like those of a lady which all but threw him on his wellformed though meaningless nose
lucilla shook her head with an exasperated look and contracted her lips with disdain as he passed her on his illomened career
of course he came right up against the little table on which she had with her own hand arranged a bouquet of geraniums and mignonette
it is what he always does she said to the doctor calmly as tom arrived at that climax of his fate and the look with which she accompanied these words as she rang the bell smartly and promptly mollified the doctor's heart
i can tell you the size of the room if that is all you want said dr marjoribanks
i suppose you mean to give parties and drive me out of my senses with dancing and singingno lucilla you must wait till you get marriedthat will never do for me
dear papa said lucilla sweetly it is so dreadful to hear you say parties
everybody knows that the only thing i care for in life is to be a comfort to you and as for dancing i saw at once that was out of the question
dancing is all very well said miss marjoribanks thoughtfully but it implies quantities of young peopleand young people can never make what i call society
it is evenings i mean to have papa
i am sure you want to go downstairs and i suppose tom would think it civil to sit with me though he is tired so i will show you a good example and thomas can pick up the table and the flowers at his leisure
goodnight papa said lucilla giving him her round fresh cheek to kiss
she went out of the room with a certain triumph feeling that she had fully signified her intentions which is always an important matter and shook hands in a condescending way with tom who had broken his shins in a headlong rush to open the door
she looked at him with an expression of mild despair and shook her head again as she accorded him that sign of amity
if you only would look a little where you are going said miss marjoribanksperhaps she meant the words to convey an allegorical as well as a positive meaning as so many people have been found out to doand then she pursued her peaceful way upstairs
as for the doctor he went off to his library rubbing his hands glad to be released and laughing softly at his nephew's abashed looks
she knows how to put him down at least the doctor said to himself well pleased and he was so much amused by his daughter's superiority to the vulgar festivity of parties that he almost gave in to the idea of refurnishing the drawingroom to suit lucilla's complexion
he rubbed his hands once more over the fire and indulged in a little laugh all by himself over that original idea
so it is evenings she means to have
said the doctor and to be sure nothing could be more faded than the curtains and there were bits of the carpet in which the pattern was scarcely discernible
so that on the whole up to this point there seemed to be a reasonable prospect that lucilla would have everything her own way
chapter vii   miss marjoribanks had so many things to think of next morning that she found her cousin who was rather difficult to get rid of much in her way naturally the young man was briefless and came on circuit for the name of the thing and was quite disposed to dawdle the first morning and attach himself to the active footsteps of lucilla and for her part she had things to occupy her so very much more important
for one thing one of dr marjoribanks's little dinnerparties was to take place that evening which would be the first under the new rgime and was naturally a matter of some anxiety to all parties
i shall go down and ask mrs chiley to come with the colonel said lucilla
i have always meant to do that
we can't have a full dinnerparty you know as long as the house is so shabby but i am sure mrs chiley will come to take care of me
to take care of youin your father's house
do you think they'll bite
said the doctor grimly but as for lucilla she was quite prepared for that
i must have a chaperone you know she said
i don't say it is not quite absurd but then at first i always make it a point to give in to the prejudices of society
that is how i have always been so successful said the experienced lucilla
i never went in the face of anybody's prejudices
afterwards you know when one is known  the doctor laughed but at the same time he sighed
there was nothing to be said against mrs chiley who had on the whole as women go a very superior training and knew what a good dinner was but it was the beginning of the revolution of which dr marjoribanks vaguely oppressed with the idea of new paper new curtains and all that was involved in the entrance of mr holden the upholsterer into the house did not see the end
he acquiesced of course since there was nothing else for it but it must be confessed that the spectre of mrs chiley sitting at his right hand clouded over for the doctor the pleasant anticipation of the evening
if it had been possible to put her at the head of the table beside lucilla whom she was to come to take care of he could have borne it betterand to be sure it would have been a great deal more reasonable but then that was absolutely out of the question and the doctor gave in with a sigh
thus it was that he began to realise the more serious result of that semiabdication into which he had been beguiled
the female element so long peacefully ignored and kept at a distance had come in again in triumph and taken possession and the doctor knew too well by the experience of a long life what a restless and troublesome element it was
he had begun to feel that it had ceased to be precisely amusing as he took his place in his brougham
it was good sport to see lucilla make an end of tom and put her bridle upon the stiff neck of nancy but when it came to changing the character of the doctor's dinners his intellect naturally got more obtuse and he did not see the joke
as for tom he had to be disposed of summarily
do go away miss marjoribanks said in her straightforward way
you can come back to luncheon if you likethat is to say if you can pick up anybody that is very amusing you may bring him here about halfpast one and if any of my friends have come to call by that time i will give you lunch but it must be somebody very amusing or i will have nothing to say to you said lucilla
and with this dismissal tom marjoribanks departed not more content than the doctor for to be sure the last thing in the world which the poor fellow thought of was to bring somebody who was amusing to injure his chances with lucilla
tom like most other people was utterly incapable of fathoming the grand conception which inspired miss marjoribanks
when she told him that it was the object of her life to be a comfort to papa he believed it to a certain extent but it never occurred to him that filial devotion though beautiful to contemplate would preserve lucilla's heart from the ordinary dangers of youth or that she was at all in earnest in postponing all matrimonial intentions until she was nineandtwenty and had begun to go off a little
so he went away disconsolate enough wavering between his instinct of obedience and his desire of being in lucilla's company and a desperate determination never to be the means of injuring himself by presenting to her anybody who was very amusing
all miss marjoribanks's monde as it happened was a little out of humour that day
she had gone on so far triumphantly that it had now come to be necessary that she should receive a little check in her victorious career
when tom was disposed of miss marjoribanks put on her hat and went down grange lane to carry her invitation to mrs chiley who naturally was very much pleased to come
but my dear you must tell me what to put on the old lady said
i don't think i have had anything new since you were home last
i have heard so much about dr marjoribanks's dinners that i feel a little excited as if i was going to be made a freemason or something
there is my brown you know that i wear at home when we have anybodyand my black velvet and then there is my french gray that i got for mary chiley's marriage
dear mrs chiley said lucilla it doesn't matter in the least what you wear there are only to be gentlemen you know and one never dresses for gentlemen
you must keep that beautiful black velvet for another time
well my dear said mrs chiley i am long past that sort of thingbut the men think you know that it is always for them we dress
yes said miss marjoribanks their vanity is something dreadfulbut it is one of my principles never to dress unless there are ladies
a white frock high in the neck said lucilla with sweet simplicityas for anything else it would be bad style
mrs chiley gave her young visitor a very cordial kiss when she went away
the sense she has
said the old lady but at the same time the colonel's wife was so oldfashioned that this contemptuous way of treating the gentlemen puzzled her unprogressive intelligence
she thought it was superhuman virtue on lucilla's part nearly incredible and yet established by proofs so incontestable that it would be a shame to doubt it and she felt ashamed of herselfshe who might have been a grandmother had such been the will of providencefor lingering five minutes undecided between her two best caps
i dare say lucilla does not spend so much time on such vanity and she only nineteen said the penitent old lady
as for miss marjoribanks she returned up grange lane with a mind at ease and that consciousness of superior endowments which gives amiability and expansion even to the countenance
she did not give any money to the beggar who at that period infested grange lane with her six children for that was contrary to those principles of political economy which she had studied with such success at mount pleasant but she stopped and asked her name and where she lived and promised to inquire into her case
if you are honest and want to work i will try to find you something to do said miss marjoribanks which to be sure was a threat appalling enough to keep her free from any further molestation on the part of that interesting family
but lucilla to do her justice felt it equally natural that beneficence should issue from her in this manner as in that other mode of feeding the hungry which she was willing to adopt at halfpast one and had solemnly engaged herself to fulfil at seven o'clock
she went up after that to mr holden's and had a most interesting conversation and found among his stores a delicious damask softly spiritually green of which to his great astonishment she tried the effect in one of the great mirrors which ornamented the shop
it is just the tint i want lucilla said when she had applied that unusual test and she left the fashionable upholsterer of carlingford in a state of some uncertainty whether it was curtains or dresses that miss marjoribanks meant to have made
perhaps this confusion arose from the fact that lucilla's mind was occupied in discussing the question whether she should not go round by grove street and try that duet again with barbara and invite her to grange lane in the evening to electrify the little company or whether in case this latter idea might not be practicable she should bring barbara with her to lunch by way of occupying tom marjoribanks
lucilla stood at mr holden's door for five seconds at least balancing the matter but finally she gave her curls a little shake and took a quick step forward and without any more deliberation returned towards grange lane for on the whole it was better not to burst in full triumph all at once upon her constituency and exhaust her forces at the beginning
if she condescended to sing something herself it would indeed be a greater honour than her father's dinnerparty in strict justice was entitled to and as for the second question though miss marjoribanks was too happy in the confidence of her own powers to fear any rivals and though her cousin's devotion bored her still she felt doubtful how far it was good policy to produce barbara at luncheon for the purpose of occupying tom
other people might see her besides tom and her own grand coup might be forestalled for anything she could tell and then tom had some title to consideration on his own merits though he was the unlucky member of the family
he might even if he were so far left to himself though miss marjoribanks smiled at the idea fall in love with barbara or what was more likely driven to despair by lucilla's indifference he might pretend to fall in love and lucilla reflected that if anything happened she could never forgive herself
this was the point she had arrived at when she shook her tawny curls and set out suddenly on her return home
it was now nearly one o'clock and it was quite possible that tom as well as herself might be on the way to grange lane but lucilla who as she said made a point of never going against the prejudices of society made up her mind to remain sweetly unconscious of the hour of luncheon unless some lady came to keep her company
but then miss marjoribanks was always lucky as she said
a quarter of an hour before tom applied for admission miss bury came to pay lucilla a visit
she had been visiting in her district all the morning and was very easily persuaded to repose herself a little and then naturally she was anxious about her young friend's spiritual condition and the effect upon her mind of a year's residence abroad
she was asking whether lucilla had not seen something souldegrading and dishonouring to religion in all the mummeries of popery and miss marjoribanks who was perfectly orthodox had replied to the question in the most satisfactory manner when tom made his appearance looking rather sheepish and reluctant and followed by the somebody amusing whom lucilla had commissioned him to bring
he had struggled against his fate poor fellow
but when it happens to be a man's instinct to do what he is told he can no more resist it than if it was a criminal impulse
tom entered with his amusing companion who had been chosen with care and was very uninviting to look at and by and by miss bury with the most puzzled looks found herself listening to gossip about the theatres and all kinds of profane subjects
i think they are going to hang that fellow that killed the tailor said the amusing man that will stir you up a little in carlingford i should suppose
it is as good as a play for a country town
of course there will be a party that will get up a memorial and prove that a man so kindhearted never existed out of paradise and there will be another party who will prove him to be insane and then at the end all the blackguards within a hundred miles will crowd into carlingford and the fellow will be hanged as he deserves to be but i assure you it's a famous amusement for a country town
sir said miss bury with a tremulous voice for her feelings had overcome her when you speak of amusement does it ever occur to you what will become of his miserable soul
i assure you wretches of that description have no souls said the young barrister or else of course i would not permit myself to speak so freely
it is a conclusion i have come to not rashly but after many opportunities of observing the young man went on with solemnity on the whole my opinion is that this is the great difference between one portion of mankind and the other that description of being you may take my word for it has no soul
i never take anybody's word for what is so plainly stated in the holy scriptures said miss bury i never heard any one utter such a terrible idea
i am sure i don't want to defend aa murderer cried the rector's sister with agitation but i have heard of persons in that unfortunate position coming to a heavenly frame of mind and giving every evidence of being truly converted
the law may take their lives but it is an awful thinga truly dreadful thing said miss bury trembling all over to try to take away their soul
oh nonsense lucilla
by jove
he does not mean that you know said tom interposing to relieve his friend
do you believe in jove mr thomas marjoribanks said miss bury looking him in an alarming manner full in the face
the unfortunate tom grew red and then he grew green under this question and that awful look
no miss bury i can't say i do he answered humbly and the amusing man was so much less brotherly than tom that he burst into unsympathetic laughter
as for lucilla it was the first real check she had sustained in the beginning of her career
there could not have been a more unfortunate contretemps and there is no telling how disastrous the effect might have been had not her courage and coolness not to say her orthodoxy been equal to the occasion
she gave her cousin a look which was still more terrible than miss bury's and then she took affairs into her own hands
it is dreadful sometimes to see what straits people are put to to keep up the conversation said lucilla tom in particular for i think he has a pleasure in talking nonsense
but you must not suppose i am of that opinion
i remember quite well there was a dreadful man once here in jail for something and mr bury made him the most beautiful character
every creature has a soul
i am sure we say so in the creed every day of our lives and especially in that long creed where so many people perish everlastingly
so far from laughing it is quite dreadful to think of it said lucilla
it is one of my principles never to laugh about anything that has to do with religion
i always think it my duty to speak with respect
it has such a bad effect upon some minds
miss bury if you will not take anything more i think we had better go upstairs
to think that tom whose luck as usual had betrayed him to such an unlookedfor extent should have been on the point of following to the drawingroom was more than miss marjoribanks could comprehend but fortunately his companion had more sense and took his leave taking his conductor with him
miss bury went upstairs in silence sighing heavily from time to time
the good woman was troubled in her spirit at the evident depravity of the young men with whom circumstances had constrained her to sit down at table and she was sadly afraid that such companionship must have a debasing effect upon the mind of that lamb of the flock now standing before her
miss bury bethought herself of dr marjoribanks's profane jokes and the indifference he had shown to many things in which it was his duty to have interested himself and she could not but look with tender pity in her young friend's face
poor dear said miss bury it is dreadful indeed if this is the sort of society you are subjected to
i could recommend to dr marjoribanks a most admirable woman a true christian who would take charge of things and be your companion lucilla
it is not at all nice for you at your age to be obliged to receive young men like these alone
i had you
said lucilla taking both miss bury's hands
i felt it was such a blessing
i would not have let tom stay for luncheon if you had not been there and now i am so glad because it has shown me the danger of letting him bring people
i am quite sure it was a special providence that made you think of coming here today
well my dear said miss bury who was naturally mollified by this statement of the question i am very glad to have been of use to you
if there is anything i desire in this life it is to be useful to my fellowcreatures and to do my work while it is called day
i should not think the time lost my dear lucilla if i could only hope that i had impressed upon your mind that an account must be given of every careless word  oh yes said lucilla that is so true and besides it is quite against my principles
i make it a point never to speak of anything about religion except with the greatest respect and i am quite sure it was a special providence that i had you
miss bury took her farewell very affectionately not to say effusively after this with her heart melting over the ingenuous young creature who was so thankful for her protection but at the same time she left miss marjoribanks a prey to the horrible sensation of having made a failure
to be sure there was time to recover herself in the evening which was so to speak her first formal appearance before the public of carlingford
tom was so illadvised as to come in when she was having her cup of tea before dinner to fortify her for her exertions and the reception he met with may be left to the imagination
but after all there was little satisfaction in demolishing tom and then lucilla had known from the beginning that the success of her undertaking depended entirely on herself
chapter viii   the evening passed off in a way which if miss marjoribanks had been an ordinary woman would have altogether obliterated from her mind all recollection of the failure at lunch
to speak first of the most important particular the dinner was perfect
as for the benighted men who had doubted lucilla they were covered with shame and at the same time with delight
if there had been a fault in dr marjoribanks's table under the ancient rgime it lay in a certain want of variety and occasional overabundance which wounded the feelings of young mr cavendish who was a person of refinement
tonight as that accomplished critic remarked there was a certain air of feminine grace diffused over everythingand an amount of doubt and expectation unknown to the composed feastings of old gave interest to the meal
as for the doctor he found mrs chiley at his right hand not so great a bore as he expected
she was a woman capable of appreciating the triumphs of art that were set before her and had indeed been trained to as high a pitch of culture in this respect as perhaps is possible to the female intelligence and then her pride and delight in being admitted to a participation in those sacred mysteries was beyond expression
my dear lucilla i feel exactly as if i was going to be made a freemason and as if your dear good papa had to blindfold me and make me swear all sorts of things before he took me downstairs she said as they sat together waiting for the commencement of the ceremony and when the two ladies returned to the drawingroom mrs chiley took lucilla in her arms and gave her a kiss as the only way of expressing adequately her enthusiasm
my love said the colonel's wife i never realised before what it was to have a genius
you should be very thankful to providence for giving you such a gift
i have given dinners all my lifethat is all my married life my dear which comes to almost the same thing for i was only a babybut i never could come up to anything like that said mrs chiley with tears in her eyes
as for miss marjoribanks she was so satisfied with her success that she felt at liberty to tranquillise her old friend
i am sure you always give very nice dinners she said and then you know the colonel has his favourite disheswhereas i must say for papa he is very reasonable for a man
i am so glad you are pleased
it is very kind of you to say it is genius but i don't pretend to anything but paying great attention and studying the combinations
there is nothing one cannot manage if one only takes the trouble
come here to this nice easychairit is so comfortable
it is so nice to have a little moment to ourselves before they come upstairs
that is what i always say said mrs chiley but there are not many girls so sensible as you lucilla
i hear them all saying it is so much better french fashion
of course i am an old woman and like things in the old style
i don't think it is because i am more sensible said miss marjoribanks with modesty
i don't pretend to be better than other people
it is because i have thought it all over you knowand then i went through a course of political economy when i was at mount pleasant lucilla said tranquilly with an air of having explained the whole matter which much impressed her hearer
but for all that something dreadful happened today
tom brought in one of his friends with him you know and miss bury was here and they talkedi want to tell you in case she should say something and then you will know what to believe
i never felt so dreadfully ashamed in my lifethey talked  my dear
not anything improper i hope cried the old lady in dismay
oh no said lucilla but they began laughing about some people having no souls you knowas if there could be anybody without a souland poor miss bury nearly fainted
you may think what a dreadful thing it was for me
my dear child if that was all said mrs chiley reassuredas for everybody having a soul i am sure i cannot say
you never were in india to be sure but miss bury should have known better than to faint at a young man's talk and frighten you my poor dear
she ought to be ashamed of herself at her age
do you think tom has turned out clever
the old lady continued not without a little finesse and watching lucilla with a curious eye
not in the very least said miss marjoribanks calmly he is just as awkward as he used to be
it is dreadful to have him here just now when i have so many things to doand then he would follow me about everywhere if i would let him
a cousin of that sort is always in the way
i am always afraid of a cousin for my part said mrs chiley and talking of that what do you think of mr cavendish lucilla
he is very nice in himself and he has a nice property and some people say he has a very good chance to be member for carlingford when there is an election
i think that is just what would suit you
i could not see him for the lamp said lucilla it was right between us you knowbut it is no use talking of that sort of thing just now
of course if i had liked i never need have come home at all miss marjoribanks added with composure and now i have come home i have got other things to think of
if papa is good i will not think of leaving him for ten years
oh yes i have heard girls say that before said mrs chiley but they always changed their minds
you would not like to be an old maid lucilla and in ten years  i should have begun to go off a little no doubt said miss marjoribanks
no i can't say i wish to be an old maid
can they be coming upstairs already do you think
oh it is tom i suppose said lucilla with a little indignation
but when they did make their appearance which was at a tolerably early periodfor a return to the drawingroom was quite a novelty for dr marjoribanks's friends and tempted them accordinglymiss marjoribanks was quite ready to receive them
and just before ten o'clock when mrs chiley began to think of going home lucilla without being asked and without indeed a word of preface suddenly went to the piano and before anybody knew had commenced to sing
she was a great deal too sensible to go into high art on this occasion or to electrify her father's friends with her newlyacquired italian or even with german as some young ladies do
she sang them a ballad out of one of those treasures of resuscitated ballads which the new generation had then begun to dig out of the bowels of the earth
there was not to tell the truth a great deal of music in it which proved lucilla's disinterestedness
i only sang it to amuse you she said when all the world crowded to the piano and for that night she was not to be persuaded to further exertions
thus miss marjoribanks proved to her little public that power of subordinating her personal tastes and even her vanity to her great object which more than anything else demonstrates a mind made to rule
i hope next time you will be more charitable and not tantalise us in this way mr cavendish said as he took his leave and lucilla retired from the scene of her triumph conscious of having achieved entire success in her first appearance in carlingford
she laid her head upon her pillow with that sweet sense of an approving conscience which accompanies the footsteps of the benefactors of their kind
but even miss marjoribanks's satisfaction was not without its drawbacks
she could not get out of her mind that unhappy abortive luncheon and all its horrors not to speak of the possibility of her religious principles being impugned which was dreadful in itself for people can stand a man being sceptical you know miss marjoribanks justly observed but everybody knows how unbecoming it is in a womanand me who have such a respect for religion
 there remained the still more alarming chance that miss bury who was so narrowminded might see something improper in the presence of the two young men at lucilla's maidenly table for to be sure the rector's sister was altogether incapable of grasping the idea that young men like old men and the other less interesting members of the human family were simple material for miss marjoribanks's genius out of which she had a great result to produce
this was the dread that overshadowed the mind of lucilla as she composed herself to rest after her fatigues
when she slept the sleep of the innocent it still pursued her into her dreams
she dreamed that she stood at the altar by the side of the member for carlingford and that mr bury with inflexible cruelty insisted upon marrying her to tom marjoribanks instead and then the scene changed and instead of receiving the salutations of mr cavendish as mp
for the borough it was the amusing man in the character of the defeated candidate who grinned and nodded at her and said from the hustings that he would never forget the luncheon that had been his first introduction to carlingford
such was the nightmare that pursued lucilla even into the sphere of dreams
when such a presentiment takes possession of a wellbalanced mind like that of miss marjoribanks it may be accepted as certain that something is likely to follow
lucilla did her best to disarm fate not only by the sweetest submission and dutifulness to the doctor and his wishes but by a severe disregard of tom which drove that unhappy young man nearly desperate
far from saying anything about luncheon she even ignored his presence at breakfast and remained calmly unconscious of his empty cup until he had to ask for some coffee in an injured and pathetic voice which amused dr marjoribanks beyond description
but even this did not prove sufficient to propitiate the fates
when they were goneand it may be well to say that lucilla used this pronoun to signify the gentlemen in greater or smaller number as it might happenand she had finished all her arrangements miss marjoribanks decided upon going to grove street to pay barbara lake a visit and practise some duets which was certainly as innocent an occupation for her leisure as could be desired
she was putting on her hat with this object when the bell in the garden rang solemnly and lucilla whose curiosity conquered her good manners for the moment hastening to the window saw mr bury himself enter the garden accompanied by a black figure in deep and shabby mourning
all the tremors of the night rushed back upon her mind at the sight
she felt that the moment had arrived for a trial of her courage very different from the exertions which had hitherto sufficed her
nothing but the most solemn intentions could have supported the rector in that severe pose of his figure and features every line in which revealed an intention of being faithful and the accompanying mute in black whose office the culprit could not divine had a veil over her face and wore a widow's dress
miss marjoribanks it is true was not a woman to be discouraged by appearances but she felt her heart beat as she collected all her powers to meet this mysterious assault
she took off her hat with an instinctive certainty that for this morning at least the duet was impracticable when she heard mr bury's steady step ascending the stairs but notwithstanding it was with a perfectly cheerful politeness that she bade him welcome when he came into the room
it is so good of you to come lucilla said you that have so much to do
i scarcely could believe it when i saw you come in i thought it must be for papa
i did hope to find dr marjoribanks said the rector but as he is not at home i thought it best to come to you
this is mrs mortimer said mr bury taking the chair lucilla had indicated with a certain want of observance of his companion which betrayed to the keen perceptions of miss marjoribanks that she was a dependant of some kind or other
the rector was a very good man but was evangelical and had a large female circle who admired and swore by him and consequently he felt it in a manner natural that he should take his seat first and the place that belonged to him as the principal person present and then to be sure his mission here was for mrs mortimer's as well as miss marjoribanks's good
after this introduction the figure in black put up its veil and revealed a deprecating woman with a faint sort of pleading smile on her face
probably she was making believe to smile at the position in which she found herself but anyhow she took her seat humbly on another chair at a little distance and waited as lucilla did for the next golden words that it might please the rector to say
my sister told me what happened yesterday said mr bury
she is very sorry for you miss marjoribanks
it is sad for you to be left alone so young and without a mother and exposed toto temptations which it is difficult to withstand at your age
indeed at all ages we have great occasion to pray not to be led into temptation for the heart of man is terribly deceitful
after hearing what she had to say i thought it best to come up at once this morning and talk to dr marjoribanks
i am sure his natural good sense will teach him that you ought not to be left alone in the house
i do not see how papa can help it said lucilla
i am sure it is very sad for him as well but since dear mamma died there has been nobody but me to be a comfort to him
i think he begins to look a little cheerful now miss marjoribanks continued with beautiful simplicity looking her adversary in the face
everybody knows that to be a comfort to him is the object of my life
that is a very good feeling said the rector but it does not do to depend too much upon our feelings
you are too young to be placed in a position of so much responsibility and open to so much temptation
i was deeply grieved for dr marjoribanks when his partner in life was taken from him but my dear miss lucilla now you have come home who stand so much in need of a mother's care we must try to find some one to fill her place
lucilla uttered a scream of genuine alarm and dismay and then she came to herself and saw the force of her position
she had it in her power to turn the tables on the rector and she did not hesitate as a weaker woman might have done out of consideration for anybody's feelings
do you mean you have found some one for him to marry
she asked with a look of artless surprise bending her earnest gaze on mr bury's face
as for the rector he looked at lucilla aghast like a man caught in a trap
of course not of course not he stammered after his first pause of consternation and then he had to stop again to take breath
lucilla kept up the air of amazement and consternation which had come naturally at the first and had her eyes fixed on him leaning forward with all the eager anxiety natural to the circumstances and the unfortunate clergyman reddened from the edge of his white cravat to the roots of his gray hair
he was almost as sensitive to the idea of having proposed something improper as his sister could have been though indeed at the worst there would have been nothing improper in it had dr marjoribanks made up his mind to another wife
it is very dreadful for me that am so young to go against you said lucilla but if it is that i cannot be expected to take any part in itit would not be natural
it is the great object of my life to be a comfort to papa but if that is what you mean i could not give in to it
i am sure miss bury would understand me said miss marjoribanks and she looked so nearly on the point of tears that the rector's anxious disclaimer found words for itself
nothing of the kind my dear miss lucillanothing of the kind cried mr bury such an idea never came into my mind
i cannot imagine how i could have said anythingi can't fancy what put such an ideamrs mortimer you are not going away
lucilla had already seen with the corner of her eye that the victim had started violently and that her heavy veil had fallen over her facebut she had not taken any notice for there are cases in which it is absolutely necessary to have a victim
by this time however the poor woman had risen in her nervous undecided way
i had better goi am sure i had better go she said hurriedly clasping together a pair of helpless hands as if they could find a little strength in union
miss marjoribanks will understand you better and you will perhaps understand miss marjoribanks  oh sit down sit down said mr bury who was not tolerant of feelings
perhaps i expressed myself badly
what i meant to say was that mrs mortimer who has been a little unfortunate in circumstancessit down prayhad by a singular providence just applied to me when my sister returned home yesterday
these things do not happen by chance lucilla
we are taken care of when we are not thinking of it
mrs mortimer is a christian lady for whom i have the greatest respect
a situation to take the superintendence of the domestic affairs and to have charge of you would be just what would suit her
it must be a great anxiety to the doctor to leave you alone and without any control at your age
you may think the liberty is pleasant at first but if you had a christian friend to watch over and take care of youwhat is the matter
said the rector in great alarm
it was only that the poor widow who was to have charge of lucilla according to his benevolent intention looked so like fainting that miss marjoribanks jumped up from her chair and rang the bell hastily
it was not lucilla's way to lose time about anything she took the poor woman by the shoulders and all but lifted her to the sofa where she was lying down with her bonnet off when the rector came to his senses
to describe the feelings with which mr bury contemplated this little entr'acte which was not in his programme would be beyond our powers
he went off humbly and opened the window when he was told to do so and tried to find the eaudecologne on the table while thomas rushed downstairs for water at a pace very unlike his usual steady rate of progress
as for lucilla she stood by the side of her patient quite selfpossessed while the rector looked so foolish
she will be all right directly miss marjoribanks was saying luckily she never went right off
when you don't go right off lying down is everything
if there had been any one to run and get some water she would have got over it but luckily i saw it in time
what possible answer mr bury could make to this or how he could go on with his address in sight of the strange turn things had taken it would have been hard to say
fortunately for the moment he did not attempt it but walked about in dismay and put himself in the draught with his rheumatism and felt dreadfully vexed and angry with mrs mortimer who for her part now she had done with fainting manifested an inclination to cry for which mr bury in his heart could have whipped her had that mode of discipline been permitted in the church of england
lucilla was merciful but she could not help taking a little advantage of her victory
she gave the sufferer a glass of water and the eaudecologne to keep her from a relapse and whispered to her to lie quiet and then she came back and took her seat and begged the rector not to stand in the draught
i don't think she is strong said miss marjoribanks confidentially when she had wiled the disconcerted clergyman back to her side her colour changes so she never would be able for what there is to do here even if papa would consent to think of it
for my part i am sure i should be glad of a little assistance said lucilla but i never like to give false hopes and i don't think papa would consentshe looks nice if she was not so weak poor thingand there are such quantities of things to be done here but if you wish it mr bury i will speak to papa said miss marjoribanks lifting her eyes which were so open and straightforward to the rector's face
to tell the truth he did not in the least know what to say and the chances are he would not have been half so vexed and angry nor felt in so unchristian a disposition with the poor woman on the sofa had he meant to do her harm instead of good
yes i should be glad if you would mention it to dr marjoribanks he said without very well knowing what he said and got up to shake hands with lucilla and then recollected that he could not leave his protge behind him and hesitated and did not know what to do
he was really grateful without being aware of it to miss marjoribanks when once again she came to his aid
please leave her a little said lucilla and i can make acquaintance with her you know in case papa should be disposed to think of itshe must lie still till it quite wears off
i would ask you to stay to lunch if i was not afraid of wasting your precious time  mr bury gave a little gasp of indignation but he did not say anything
on the whole even though smarting under the indignity of being asked to lunch as his sister had been when probably there might be a repetition of the scene of yesterday he was glad to get safely out of the house even at the risk of abandoning his enterprise
as for a woman in want of a situation who had so little common sense as to faint at such a critical moment the rector was disposed to wash his hands of her for mr bury like them all as lucilla said was horribly frightened by a faint when he saw one and afterwards pretended to disbelieve it and called it one of the things which a little selfcommand could always prevent
when he was gone miss marjoribanks felt the full importance of her victory and then though she had not hesitated to sacrifice this poor woman when it was necessary to have a victim that moment was over and she had no pleasure in being cruel on the contrary she went and sat by her patient and talked and was very kind to her and after a while heard all her story and was more comforting than the rector could have been for his life
i knew it would hurt your feelings miss marjoribanks said candidly but i could not do anything elseand you know it was mr bury's fault but i am sure if i can be of any use to you it was thus that lucilla added without knowing it another complication to her fortunes but then to be sure clearsighted as she was she could not see into the future nor know what was to follow
she told the doctor in the evening with the greatest faithfulness and described how mr bury looked and that she had said she did not think papa would be disposed to think of it and dr marjoribanks was so much entertained that he came upstairs to hear the end and took a cup of tea
it was the third night in succession that the doctor had taken this step though it was against his principles and thus it will be seen that good came out of evil in a beautifully distinct and appropriate way
chapter ix   it was not till miss marjoribanks had surmounted to a certain extent the vexation caused her by her unlucky confidence in tom that that unhappy young man took the step which lucilla had so long dreaded but which she trusted to her own genius to hinder him from carrying into execution
miss marjoribanks had extricated herself so triumphantly from the consequences of that unhappy commencement of her very charming luncheonparties that she had begun to forget the culpability of her cousin
she had defeated the rector in his benevolent intentions and she had taken up his protge just at the moment when mr bury was most disgusted with the unfortunate woman's weakness
poor mrs mortimer to be sure had fainted or had been near fainting at the most inopportune moment and it was only natural that the rector should be annoyed but as for lucilla who was always prompt in her actions and whose good nature and liberality were undoubted she found her opportunity in the failure of mr bury's scheme
after the rector had gone away miss marjoribanks herself conducted the widow home and by this time mrs mortimer's prospects were beginning to brighten under the active and efficient patronage of her new friend
this being the case lucilla's good humour was perfectly restored and she had forgiven tom his maladroitness
he cannot help it you know she said privately to old mrs chiley i suppose some people are born to do ridiculous things
and it was indeed as if he had intended to give a practical illustration of the truth of this conclusion that tom chose the particular moment he did for driving miss marjoribanks to the extremity of her patience
the upholsterers were in the house and indeed had just finished putting up the pictures on the new paper in the drawingroom which was green as lucilla had determined it should be of the most delicate tint and looked as she flattered herself exactly like silk hangings and mr holden himself waited with a certain complaisance for miss marjoribanks's opinion of the effect
he had no doubt on the subject himself but he was naturally impressed as most people were with that confidence in lucilla's judgment which so much facilitates the operations of those persons who are born to greatness
it was precisely at this moment that his evil genius persuaded tom marjoribanks to interrupt thomas who was carrying mr holden's message to his young mistress and to shut the library door upon the external world
lucilla had taken refuge in the library during the renovation of the drawingroom and she was aware that this was tom's last day at carlingford and had no intention of being unkind to him
to tell the truth she had at the bottom of her heart a certain regard and impulse of protection and patronage towards tom of which something might have come had the unlucky fellow known how to manage
but at the same time miss marjoribanks was aware that things must be approaching a crisis upstairs and was listening intently to the movements overhead and wondering why she was not sent for
this was the moment of all others at which tom thought fit to claim a hearing and the state of lucilla's feelings may be easily imagined when she saw him plant himself by her side with his face alternately red and white and all the signs of a desperate resolution in his countenance
for the first time in her life a certain despair took possession of miss marjoribanks's mind
the sounds had suddenly ceased upstairs as if the artists were making a pause to contemplate the effect of their completed workwhich indeed was precisely the caseand at the same time nobody came to call her important though the occasion was
she made a last effort to emancipate herself before it was too late
ring please tom she said i want to know if they have finished upstairs
i am so sorry you are going away but you know it is one of my principles never to neglect my duty
i am sure they must be waiting for meif you would only be kind enough to ring
lucilla said tom you know i would do anything in the world you liked to tell me but don't ask me to ring just now i am going to leave you and there is something i must say to you lucilla said the young man with agitation
miss marjoribanks was seated near the window and she had a moral certainty that if any of the browns happened to be in that ridiculous glasshouse where they did their photography they must have a perfectly good view of her with tom in the background who had placed himself so as to shut her into the recess of the window
this coupled with the evidence of her senses that the workmen up stairs had ceased their work and that a slow footstep traversing the floor now and then was all that was audible drove lucilla to despair
yes she said temporising a little which was the only thing she could do i am sure i am very sorry but then you know with the house in such a condition
next time you come i shall be able to enjoy your society said the designing young woman but at present i am so busy
it is one of my principles you know that things are never rightly done if the lady of the house does not pay proper attention
they are sure to make some dreadful mistake upstairs if i don't look after them
i shall see you again before you go
lucilla don't be so cruel
cried the unlucky tom and he caught her hand though they were at the window do stop a moment and listen to me
lucilla
what does it matter about furniture and things when a man's heart is bursting
cried the unfortunate lover and just at that moment miss marjoribanks could see that the curtain was drawn aside a littleever so littlein the glasshouse
she sat down again with a sigh and drew her hand away and prepared herself to meet her fate with heroism at least
what in the world can you have been doing
said lucilla innocently you used always to tell me you know when you got into any difficulty and i am sure if i can be of any use to you tombut as for furniture and things they matter a great deal i assure you to people's happiness and then you know it is the object of my life to be a comfort to dear papa
when she said this miss marjoribanks settled herself again in the recess of the window so that the miss browns could command a full view if they chose for lucilla's courage was of the highest order and nothing except perhaps a strategical necessity of profound importance would have moved her to retreat before an enemy
as for tom he was bewildered to start with by this solemn repetition of her great purpose
i know how good you are lucilla he said with humility but then my uncle you knowi don't think he is a man to appreciateoh lucilla
why should you go and sacrifice to him the happiness of your life
tom said miss marjoribanks with some solemnity i wish you would not talk to me of happiness
i have always been brought up to believe that duty was happiness and everybody has known for a long time what was the object of my life
as for poor papa it is the worse for him if he does not understand but that does not make any difference to my duty said the devoted daughter
she gave a little sigh as she spoke the sigh of a great soul whose motives must always remain to some extent unappreciated and the sight of her resignation and beautiful perseverance overwhelmed her unlucky suitor for indeed up to this moment lucilla still entertained the hope of preventing tom from as she herself described it saying the very words which to be sure are awkward words to hear and to say
lucilla when you are so good to my uncle you ought to have a little pity on me said tom driven to the deepest despondency
how do you think i can bear it to see you getting everything done here as if you meant to stay all your lifewhen you know i love you
said the unfortunate young man when you know i have always been so fond of you lucilla and always looked forward to the time and now it is very hard to see you care so little for me
tom said miss marjoribanks with indignant surprise how can you say i care little for you
you know i was always very fond of you on the contrary
i am sure i always stood your friend at home whatever happened and never said a word when you broke that pretty little pearl ring i was so fond of and tore the scarf that my aunt gave me
i wonder for my part how you can be so unkind as so say so
we have always been the very best friends in the world said lucilla with an air of injury
i always said at school i liked you the best of all my cousins and i am very fond of all my cousins
miss marjoribanks concluded after a little pause it is so unkind to tell me that i don't care for you
poor tom groaned within himself as he listened
he did not know what to answer to lucilla's aggrieved yet frank confession
naturally it would have been much less displeasing to tom to understand that she hated him and never desired to see him any more
but miss marjoribanks was far from entertaining any such unchristian sentiments
she even began to forget her anxiety about what was going on upstairs in that delightful sense of power and abundant resources with which she was mastering the present difficulty
she reflected in herself that though it was excessively annoying to be thus occupied at such a moment still it was nearly as important to make an end of tom as to see that the pictures were hung rightly for to be sure it was always easy to return to the latter subject
accordingly she drew her chair a little nearer to the window and regarded tom with a calm gaze of benevolent interest which was in perfect accordance with the sentiments she had just expressed a look in which a gentle reproach was mingled
i have always been like a sister to you said lucilla how can you be so unkind as to say i don't care
as for the unhappy tom he got up as was natural and took a little walk in front of the table as a young man in trouble is apt to do
you know very well that is not what i mean lucilla he said disconsolately
it is you who are unkind
i don't know why it is that ladies are so cruel i am not such a snob as to persecute anybody
but what is the good of pretending not to know what i mean
tom listen
cried miss marjoribanks rising in her turn i feel sure they must have finished
there is mr holden going through the garden
and everybody knows that hanging pictures is just the thing of all others that requires a person of taste
if they have spoiled the room it will be all your fault
oh for heaven's sake never mind the room
said tom
i never thought you would have trifled with a man lucilla
you know quite well what i mean you know it isn't aa new thing said the lover beginning to stammer and get confused
you know that is what i have been thinking of all along as soon as ever i had anything to live on
i love you lucilla you know i love you
how can you trifle with me so
it is you who are trifling said miss marjoribanks especially when you know i have really something of importance to do
you can come upstairs with me if you like
of course we all love each other
what is the good of being relations otherwise
said lucilla calmly it is such a natural thing you know
i suppose it is because you are going away that you are so affectionate today
it is very nice of you i am sure but tom i feel quite certain you have not packed your things miss marjoribanks added in an admonitory tone
come along with me upstairs
and by this time lucilla's curiosity was beginning again to get the upper hand
if she only could have escaped it would have been impossible for her cousin to have renewed the conversation and luckily he was to leave carlingford the same evening but then a man is always an inconsequent creature and not to be calculated on
this time instead of obeying as usual tomhaving as miss marjoribanks afterwards described but only in the strictest confidence worked himself up to itset himself directly in her way and seized upon both her hands
lucilla cried the unlucky fellow is it possible that you really have misunderstood me all this time
do you mean to say that you don't know
oh lucilla listen just five minutes
it isn't because i am your cousin
i wish to heaven i was not your cousin but some one you had never seen before
i mean i want you to consent tototomarry me lucilla
that is what i mean
i am called to the bar and i can work for you and make a reputation
lucilla listen to what i have to say
miss marjoribanks left her hands in his with a calmness which froze poor tom's heart in his breast
she did not even take the trouble to draw them away
have you gone out of your senses tom
she asked in her sensible way and she lifted her eyes to the face of the poor young fellow who was in love with an inquiring look as if she felt a little anxious about him
if you have any feeling as if fever was coming on said lucilla i think you should go upstairs and lie down a little till papa comes in
i heard there had been some cases down about the canal
i hope it is not the assizes that have been too much for you
when miss marjoribanks said this she herself took fast hold of tom's hands with a motherly grasp to feel if they were hot and looked into his eyes with a certain serious inspection which under the circumstances poor fellow
was enough to drive him out of the little rationality he had left
tom was so far carried away by his frenzy that he gave her a little shake in his impatience
you are trying to drive me mad lucilla
cried the young man
i have got no fever
it is only you who are driving me out of my senses
this time you must hear me
i will not let you go till you have given me an answer
i am called to the bar and i have begun my career said tom making a pause for breath
i knew you would have laughed at me when i was depending on my mother but now all that is over lucilla
i have loved you as long as i can remember and i always thoughtthat youcared for me a little
if you will have me there is nothing i could not do said tom who thoroughly believed what he was saying and if you will not have me i will not answer for the consequences
if i go off to india or if i go to the bad  tom said lucilla solemnly and this time she drew away her hands if you ever want to get married i think the very best thing you can do is to go to india
as for marrying just now at your age you know you might as well jump into the sea
you need not be vexed said miss marjoribanks in her motherly way
i would not speak so if i was not your best friend
as for marrying me you know it is ridiculous
i have not the least intention of marrying anybody
if i had thought of that i need never have come home at all
as for your going to the bad i am not afraid of that
if i were to let you carry on with such a ridiculous idea i should never forgive myself
it would be just as sensible to go into a lunatic asylum at once
it is very lucky for you that you said this to me lucilla went on and not to one of the girls that think it great fun to be married
and if i were you tom i would go and pack my things
you know you are always too late and don't jump on your portmanteau and make such a dreadful noise if it won't shut but ring the bell for thomas
you know we are to dine at halfpast five today to give you time for the train
these were the last words tom marjoribanks heard as lucilla left the room
she ran up to the drawingroom without losing a minute and burst in upon the vacant place where mr holden had stood so long waiting for her
to be sure miss marjoribanks's forebodings were so far fulfilled that the st cecilia which she meant to have over the piano was hung quite in the other corner of the room by reason of being just the same size as another picture at the opposite angle which the workmen sternly symmetrical thought it necessary to match
but after all that was a trifling defect
she stood in the middle of the room and surveyed the walls well pleased with a heart which kept beating very steadily in her bosom
on the whole perhaps she was not sorry to have had it out with tom
so far as he was personally concerned miss marjoribanks being a physician's daughter had great faith in the vis medicatrix and was not afraid for her cousin's health or his morals as a less experienced woman might have been
if she was angry with anybody it was with herself who had not taken sufficient precautions to avoid the explanation
but after all everything is for the best lucilla said to herself with that beautiful confidence which is common to people who have things their own way and she devoted her mind to the st cecilia and paid no more attention to tom
it was not till more than an hour after that a succession of dreadful thumps was not only heard but felt throughout the house
it was tom but he was not doing any harm to himself
he was not blowing out his brains or knocking his head against the wall
he was only jumping on his portmanteau notwithstanding that lucilla had warned him against such a proceedingand in his state of mind the jumps were naturally more frantic than usual
when lucilla heard it she rang the bell and told thomas to go and help mr tom with his packing from which it will be seen that miss marjoribanks bore no grudge against her cousin but was disposed to send him forth in friendship and peace
chapter x   it was nearly six weeks after this before all miss marjoribanks's arrangements were completed and she was able with satisfaction to herself to begin her campaign
it was just before christmas at the time above all others when society has need of a ruling spirit
for example mrs chiley expected the colonel's niece mary chiley who had been married about six months before and who was not fond of her husband's friends and at the same time had no home of her own to go to being an orphan
the colonel had invited the young couple by way of doing a kind thing but he grumbled a little at the necessity and had never liked the fellow he saidand then what were two old people to do to amuse them
then mrs centum had her two eldest boys home from school and was driven out of her senses by the noise and the racket as she confided to her visitors
it is all very well to make pretty pictures about christmas said the exasperated mother but i should like to know how one can enjoy anything with such a commotion going on
i get up every morning with a headache i assure you and then mr centum expects me to be cheerful when he comes in to dinner men are so unreasonable
i should like to know what they would do if they had what we have to go through to look after all the servantsand they are always out of their senses at christmasand to see that the children don't have too much pudding and to support all the noise
the holidays are the hardest work a poor woman can have she concluded with a sigh and when it is taken into consideration that this particular christmas was a wet christmas without any frost or possibility of amusement out of doors english matrons in general will not refuse their sympathy to mrs centum
mrs woodburn perhaps was equally to be pitied in a different way
she had to receive several members of her husband's family who were like miss marjoribanks without any sense of humour and who stared and did not in the least understand her when she took off any of her neighbours not to say that some of them were lowchurch and thought the practice sinful
under these circumstances it will be readily believed that the commencement of lucilla's operations was looked upon with great interest in carlingford
it was so opportune that society forgot its usual instincts of criticism and forgave miss marjoribanks for being more enlightened and enterprising than her neighbours and then most people were very anxious to see the drawingroom now it had been restored
this was a privilege however not accorded to the crowd
mrs chiley had seen it under a vow of secrecy and mr cavendish owned to having made a run upstairs one evening after one of dr marjoribanks's little dinners when the other convives were in the library where lucilla had erected her temporary throne
but this clandestine inspection met with the failure it deserved for there was no light in the room except the moonlight which made three white blotches on the carpet where the windows were burying everything else in the profoundest darkness and the spy knocked his foot against something which reduced him to sudden and wellmerited agony
as for mrs chiley she was discretion itself and would say nothing even to her niece
i mean to work her a footstool in waterlilies my dear like the one i did for you when you were married the old lady said and that was the only light she would throw on the subject
my opinion is that it must be in crimson mrs woodburn said when she heard this for i know your aunt's waterlilies
when i see them growing i always think of you
it would be quite like lucilla marjoribanks to have it in crimsonfor it is a cheerful colour you know and quite different from the old furniture and that would always be a comfort to her dear papa
from this it will be seen that the curiosity of carlingford was excited to a lively extent
many people even went so far as to give the browns a sitting in their glasshouse with the hope of having a peep at the colour of the hangings at least
but miss marjoribanks was too sensible a woman to leave her virgin drawingroom exposed to the sun when there was any and to the photographers who were perhaps more dangerous
i think it is blue for my part said miss brown who had got into the habit of rising early in hopes of finding the doctor's household off its guard
lucilla was always a great one for blue she thinks it is becoming to her complexion which indeed as the readers of this history are aware was a matter of fact
as for miss marjoribanks she did her best to keep up this agreeable mystery
for my part i am fond of neutral tints she herself said when she was questioned on the subject anybody who knows me can easily guess my taste
i should have been born a quaker you know i do so like the drabs and grays and all those soft colours
you can have as much red and green as you like abroad where the sun is strong but here it would be bad style said lucilla from which the most simpleminded of her auditors drew the natural conclusion
thus all the world contemplated with excitement the first thursday which was to open this enchanted chamber to their admiring eyes
don't expect any regular invitation miss marjoribanks said
i hope you will all come or as many of you as can
papa has always some men to dinner with him that day you know and it is so dreadfully slow for me with a heap of men
that is why i fixed on thursday
i want you to come every week so it would be absurd to send an invitation and remember it is not a party only an evening said lucilla
i shall wear a white frock high as i always do
now be sure you come
but we can't all go in high white frocks said mrs chiley's niece mary who if her trousseau had been subtracted from the joys of marriage would not poor soul
have found very much left
this intimation dismayed the bride a little for to be sure she had decided which dress she was to wear before lucilla spoke
but my dear you are married said miss marjoribanks that makes it quite different come in that pretty pink that is so becoming
i don't want to have any dowdies for my part and don't forget that i shall expect you all at nine o'clock
when she had said this miss marjoribanks proceeded on her way sowing invitations and gratification round her
she asked the youngest miss brown to bring her music in recognition of her ancient claims as the songstress of society in carlingford for lucilla had all that regard for constituted rights which is so necessary to a revolutionary of the highest class
she had no desire to shock anybody's prejudices or wound anybody's feelings
and she has a nice little voice lucilla said to herself with the most friendly and tolerant feelings
thus miss marjoribanks prepared to establish her kingdom with a benevolence which was almost utopian not upon the ruins of other thrones but with the goodwill and cooperation of the lesser powers who were to be sure too feeble to resist her advance but whose rights she was quite ready to recognise and even to promote in her own way
at the same time it is necessary here to indicate a certain vague and not disagreeable danger which appeared to some experienced persons to shadow lucilla's conquering way
mr cavendish who was a young man of refinement not to say that he had a very nice property had begun to pay attention to miss marjoribanks in what mrs chiley thought quite a marked manner
to be sure he could not pretend to the honour of taking her in to dinner which was not his place being a young man but he did what was next best and manoeuvred to get the place on her left hand which in a party composed chiefly of men was not difficult to manage
for to tell the truth most of the gentlemen present were at that special moment more interested in the dinner than in lucilla
and after dinner it was mr cavendish who was the first to leave the room and to hear the two talking about all the places they had been to and all the people they had met was as good as a play mrs chiley said
mr cavendish confided to lucilla his opinions upon things in general and accepted the reproofs which she administered for miss marjoribanks was quite unquestionable in her orthodoxy and thought it a duty as she said always to speak with respect of religion when his sentiments were too speculative and said how charming is divine philosophy
so as for the moment to dazzle lucilla herself who thought it a very pretty compliment
he came to her assistance when she made tea and generally fulfilled all the duties which are expected of a man who is paying attention to a young lady
old mrs chiley watched the nascent regard with her kind old grandmotherly eyes
she calculated over in her own mind the details of his possessions so far as the public was aware of them and found them on the whole satisfactory
he had a nice property and then he was a very nice indeed an unexceptionable young man and to add to this it had been agreed to between colonel chiley and mr centum and several other of the leading people in carlingford that he was the most likely man to represent the borough when old mr chiltern who was always threatening to retire fulfilled his promise
mr cavendish had a very handsome house a little out of town where a lady would be next thing to a county ladyindeed quite a county lady if her husband was the member for carlingford
all these thoughts passed through mrs chiley's mind and as was natural in the precious moments after dinner were suggested in occasional words of meaning to the understanding ear of miss marjoribanks
my dear lucilla it is just the position that would suit youwith your talents
the old lady said and lucilla did not say no
to be sure she had not at the present moment the least inclination to get married as she truly said it would indeed to tell the truth disturb her plans considerably but still if such was the intention of providence and if it was to the member for carlingford lucilla felt that it was still credible that everything might be for the best
but it is a great deal too soon to think of anything of that sort miss marjoribanks would reply
if i had thought of that i need never have come home at all and especially when papa has been so good about everything
yet for all that she was not ungracious to mr cavendish when he came in first as usual
to marry a man in his position would not after all be deranging her plans to any serious extent
indeed it would if his hopes were realised constitute lucilla a kind of queen in carlingford and she could not but feel that under these circumstances it might be a kind of duty to reconsider her resolution
and thus the time passed while the drawingroom was undergoing renovation
mr cavendish had been much tantalised she said by the absence of the piano which prevented them from having any music and lucilla had even been tempted into a few snatches of song which to tell the truth some of the gentlemen present especially the doctor himself and colonel chiley being oldfashioned preferred without the accompaniment
and thus it was under the most brilliant auspices and with the full confidence of all her future constituency that miss marjoribanks superintended the arrangement of the drawingroom on that momentous thursday which was to be the real beginning of her great work in carlingford
my dear you must leave yourself entirely in my hands lucilla said to barbara lake on the morning of that eventful day
don't get impatient
i dare say you don't know many people and it may be a little slow for you at first but everybody has to put up with that you know for a beginning
and by the bye what are you going to wear
i have not thought about it said barbara who had the painful pride of poverty aggravated much by a sense that the comforts of other people were an injury to her
poor soul
she had been thinking of little else for at least a week past and then she had not very much choice in her wardrobe but her disposition was one which rejected sympathy and she thought it would look best to pretend to be indifferent
at the same time she said this with a dull colour on her cheeks the colour of irritation and she could not help asking herself why lucilla who was not so handsome as she was had the power to array herself in gorgeous apparel while she barbara had nothing but a white frock
there are differences even in white frocks though the masculine mind may be unaware of them
barbara's muslin had been washed six times and had a very different air from the vestal robes of her patroness
to be sure lucilla was not taken in in the least by her companion's look of indifference and would even have been delighted to bestow a pretty dress upon barbara if that had been a possible thing to do
there will be no dress said miss marjoribanks with solemnity
i have insisted upon that
you know it is not a party it is only an evening
a white frock highthat is all i mean to wear and mind you don't lose patience
i shall keep my eye on you and after the first i feel sure you will enjoy yourself
goodbye for the present
when she had uttered these encouraging words
miss marjoribanks went away to pursue her preparations and barbara proceeded to get out her dress and examine it
it was as important to her as all the complicated paraphernalia of the evening's arrangements were to lucilla
it is true that there were greater interests involved in the case of the leader but then barbara was the soldier of fortune who had to open the oyster with her sword and she was feeling the point of it metaphorically while she pulled out the breadths of her white dress and tried to think that they would not look limp at night and what her sentiments lost in breadth as compared with lucilla's they gained in intensity forfor anything she could tellher life might change colour by means of this thursday evening and such indeed was her hope
barbara prepared for her first appearance in grange lane with a mind wound up to any degree of daring
it did not occur to her that she required to keep faith with miss marjoribanks in anything except the duet
as regarded other matters barbara was quite unscrupulous for at the bottom she could not but feel that any one who was kind to her was taking an unwarrantable liberty
what right had lucilla marjoribanks to be kind to her
as if she was not as good as lucilla any day
and though it might be worth her while to take advantage of it for the moment it was still an insult in its way to be avenged if an opportunity ever should arise
the evening came as evenings do come quite indifferently whether people are glad or sorry and it was with a calmness which the other ladies regarded as next to miraculous that miss marjoribanks took colonel chiley's arm to go to the diningroom
we say the other ladies for on this great occasion mrs centum and mrs woodburn were both among the dinnerguests
to see her eat her dinner as if she had nothing on her mind
mrs centum said in amazement as for me though nobody can blame me if anything goes wrong i could enjoy nothing for thinking of it
and i must say i was disappointed with the dinner she added with a certain air of satisfaction in mrs woodburn's ear
it was when they were going upstairs and lucilla was behind with mrs chiley
the fuss the men have always made about these dinners
and except for a few made dishes that were really nothing you know i can't say i saw anything particular in it
and as for lucilla i can't think she has any feeling said the banker's wife
oh my dear it is because you don't understand said mrs woodburn
she is kept up you know by a sense of duty
it is all because she has set her heart on being a comfort to her dear papa
such it is true were the comments that were made upon the publicspirited young woman who was doing so much for carlingford but then lucilla only shared the fate of all the great benefactors of the world
an hour later the glories of the furniture were veiled and hidden by the robes of a radiant flood of society embracing all that was most fair and all that was most distinguished in carlingford
no doubt there was a world of heterogeneous elements but then if there had not been difficulties where would have been the use of miss marjoribanks's genius
mr bury and his sister who had been unconsciously mollified by the admirable dinner provided for them downstairs found some stray lambs in the assembly who were in need of them and thus had the double satisfaction of combining pleasure with duty and though there were several people in the room whose lives were a burden to them in consequence of mrs woodburn's remarkable gift even they found it impossible not to be amused by an occasional representation of an absent individual or by the dashing sketch of lucilla which she gave at intervals in her corner amid the smothered laughter of the audience who were half ashamed of themselves
she is never illtempered you know the persons who felt themselves threatened in their turn said to each other with a certain piteous resignation and oddly enough it was in general the most insignificant people about who were afraid of mrs woodburn
it is needless to say that such a dread never entered the serene intelligence of miss marjoribanks who believed in herself with a reasonable and steady faith
as for old mrs chiley who had so many funny little ways and whom the mimic executed to perfection she also was quite calm on the subject
you know there is nothing to take off in me the old lady would say i always was a simple body and then i am old enough to be all your grandmothers my dear which was a saying calculated as miss marjoribanks justly observed to melt a heart of stone
then the miss browns had brought their photographs in which most people in grange lane were caricatured hideously but with such a charming equality that the most exigeant forgave the wrong to himself in laughing at his neighbours
miss brown had brought her music too and sang her feeble little strain to the applause of her immediate neighbours and to the delight of those who were at a distance and who could talk louder and flirt more openly under cover of the music and there were other young ladies who had also come prepared with a little roll of songs or pieces
lucilla with her finger as it were upon the pulse of the company let them all exhibit their powers with that enlightened impartiality which we have already remarked in her
when mr cavendish came to her in his ingratiating way and asked her how she could possibly let all the sparrows chirp like that when the nightingale was present miss marjoribanks proved herself proof to the flattery
she said do go away like a good man and make yourself agreeable
there are so few men you know who can flirt in carlingford
i have always reckoned upon you as such a valuable assistant
it is always an advantage to have a man who flirts said miss marjoribanks
this was a sentiment perhaps too large and enlightened in the truest sense of the word to meet as it ought to have done with the applause of her audience
most of the persons immediately surrounding her thought indeed that it was a mere bonmot to which lucilla had given utterance and laughed accordingly but it is needless to explain that these were persons quite unable to understand her genius
all this time she was keeping her eyes upon a figure in the corner of a sofa which looked as if it was glued there and kept staring defiance at the world in general from under black and level brows
lucilla it is true had introduced barbara lake in the most flattering way to mrs chiley and to some of the young ladies present but then she was a stranger and an intruder into those regions of the blest and she could not help feeling so
if her present companions had not whispered among themselves miss lake
what miss lake
good gracious
lake the drawingmaster's daughter
she herself would still have reminded herself of her humble paternity
barbara sat as if she could not move from that corner looking out upon everybody with scared eyes which expressed nothing but defiance and in her own mind making the reflections of bitter poverty upon the airy pretty figures round her in all the variations of that costume which miss marjoribanks had announced as the standard of dress for the evening
barbara's muslin six times washed was not more different from the spotless lightness of all the draperies round her than was her air of fright and at the same time of defiance from the gay babble and pleasant looks of the group which by a chance combination she seemed to form part of
she began to say to herself that she had much better go away and that there never could be anything in common between those frivolous creatures and herself a poor man's daughter and she began to get dreadfully exasperated with lucilla who had beguiled her into this scene to make game of her as poor barbara said though so far from making game of her nobody took much notice after the first unsuccessful attempt at conversation of the unfortunate young woman
it was when she was in this unhappy humour that her eye fell upon mr cavendish who was in the act of making the appeal to lucilla which we have already recorded
barbara had never as yet had a lover but she had read an unlimited number of novels which came to nearly the same thing and she saw at a glance that this was somebody who resembled the indispensable hero
she looked at him with a certain fierce interest and remembered at that instant how often in books it is the humble heroine behind backs whom all the young ladies snub who wins the hero at the last
and then miss marjoribanks though she sent him away smiled benignantly upon him
the colour flushed to barbara's cheeks and her eyes which had grown dull and fixed between fright and spite took sudden expression under her straight brows
an intention which was not so much an intention as an instinct suddenly sprang into life within her and without knowing she drew a long breath of eagerness and impotence
he was standing quite near by this time doing his duty according to miss marjoribanks's orders and flirting with all his might and barbara looked at him as a hungry schoolboy might be supposed to look at a tempting apple just out of his reach
how was she to get at this suitor of lucilla's
it would have given her so pure a delight to tear down the golden apple and tread on it and trample it to nothing and then it came into her head that it might be good to eat as well
it was at this moment that miss marjoribanks who was in six places at once suddenly touched barbara's shoulder
come with me a minute i want to show you something she said loud out
barbara on her side looked round with a crimson countenance feeling that her secret thoughts must be written in her guilty eyes
but then these were eyes which could be utterly destitute of expression when they pleased though their owner at present just at the beginning of her experience was not quite aware of the fact
she stumbled to her feet with the awkward motion natural to that form of shyness which her temper and her temperament united to produce in her
she did all but put her foot through miss brown's delicate skirt and she had neither the natural disposition nor the acquired grace which can carry off one of those trifling offences against society
nevertheless as she stood beside lucilla at the piano the company in general owned a little thrill of curiosity
who was she
a girl with splendid black hair with brows as level as if they had been made with a line with intense eyes which looked a little oblique under that straight bar of shadow
her dress was limp but she was not such a figure as could be passed over even at an evening party and then her face was a little flushed and her eyes lit up with excitement
she seemed to survey everybody with that defiant look which was chiefly awkwardness and temper but which looked like pride when she was standing up at her full height and in a conspicuous position where everybody could see her
most people concluded she was an italian whom lucilla had picked up somewhere in her travels
as for mr cavendish he stopped short altogether in the occupation which miss marjoribanks had allotted to him and drew close to the piano
he thought he had seen the face somewhere under a shabby bonnet in some bystreet of carlingford and he was even sufficiently learned in female apparel to observe the limpness of her dress
this preface of curiosity had all been foreseen by miss marjoribanks and she paused a moment under pretence of selecting her music to take the full advantage of it for lucilla like most persons of elevated aims was content to sacrifice herself to the success of her work and then all at once before the carlingford people knew what they were doing the two voices rose bursting upon the astonished community like a sudden revelation
for it must be remembered that nobody in carlingford except the members of dr marjoribanks's dinnerparty had ever heard lucilla sing much less her companion and the account which these gentlemen had carried home to their wives had been generally poohpoohed and put down
mr centum never listens to a note if he can help it said the banker's wife and how could he know whether she had a nice voice or not
which indeed was a powerful argument
but this evening there could be no mistake about it
the words were arrested on the very lips of the talkers mrs woodburn paused in the midst of doing lucilla and as we have before said mr cavendish broke a flirtation clean off at its most interesting moment
it is impossible to record what they sang for those events as everybody is aware happened a good many years ago and the chances are that the present generation has altogether forgotten the duet which made so extraordinary an impression on the inhabitants of grange lane
the applause with which the performance was received reached the length of a perfect ovation
barbara for her part who was not conscious of having ever been applauded before flushed into splendid crimson and shone out from under her straight eyebrows intoxicated into absolute beauty
as for miss marjoribanks she took it more calmly
lucilla had the advantage of knowing what she could do and accordingly she was not surprised when people found it remarkable
she consented on urgent persuasion to repeat the last verse of the duet but when that was over was smilingly obdurate
almost everybody can sing said miss marjoribanks with a magnificent depreciation of her own gift
perhaps miss brown will sing us something but as for me you know i am the mistress of the house
lucilla went away as she spoke to attend to her guests but she left barbara still crimson and splendid triumphing over her limp dress and all her disadvantages by the piano
fortunately for that evening barbara's pride and her shyness prevented her from yielding to the repeated demands addressed to her by the admiring audience
she said to mr cavendish with a disloyalty which that gentleman thought piquant that miss marjoribanks would not be pleased and the future member for carlingford thought he could not do better than obey the injunctions of the mistress of the feast by a little flirtation with the gifted unknown
to be sure barbara was not gifted in talk and she was still defiant and contradictory but then her eyes were blazing with excitement under her level eyebrows and she was as willing to be flirted with as if she had known a great deal better
and then mr cavendish had a weakness for a contralto
while this little byplay was going on lucilla was moving about the centre of a perfect tumult of applause
no more complete success could be imagined than that of this first thursday evening which was remarkable in the records of carlingford and yet perhaps miss marjoribanks like other conquerors was destined to build her victory upon sacrifice
she did not feel any alarm at the present moment but even if she had that would have made no difference to lucilla's proceedings
she was not the woman to shrink from a sacrifice when it was for the promotion of the great object of her life and that as everybody knew who knew miss marjoribanks was to be a comfort to her dear papa
chapter xi   you have never told us who your unknown was said mr cavendish
i suppose she is professional
carlingford could not possibly possess two such voices in private life
oh i don't know about two such voices said miss marjoribanks her voice suits mine you know
it is always a great thing to find two voices that suit
i never would choose to have professional singers for my part
you have to give yourself up to music when you do such a thing and that is not my idea of society
i am very fond of music said lucillaexcessively fond of it but then everybody is not of my opinionand one has to take so many things into consideration
for people who give one party in the year it does very wellbut then i hate parties the only pleasure in society is when one's friends come to see one without any ado
in white frocks high said mrs woodburn who could not help assuming lucilla's manner for the moment even while addressing herself but as the possibility of such a lsemajest did not even occur to miss marjoribanks she accepted the observation in good faith
yes i hate a grand toilette when it is only a meeting of friends she saidfor the girls you know of course you married ladies can always do what you like
you have your husbands to please said lucilla
and this was a little hard upon her satirist for to tell the truth that was a particular of domestic duty to which mrs woodburn did not much devote herself according to the opinion of grange lane
but about the contralto said mr cavendish who had come to call on miss marjoribanks under his sister's wing and desired above all things to keep the peace between the two ladies as indeed is a man's duty under such circumstances
you are always statesmanlike in your views but i cannot understand why you let poor little molly brown carry on her chirping when you had such an astonishing force in reserve
she must have been covered with confusion the poor little soul
nothing of the sort said mrs woodburn pursuing her favourite occupation as usual
she only said 'goodness me
how high lucilla goes
do you like that dreadfully high music'
and made little eyebrows
to be sure the mimic made miss brown's eyebrows and spoke in her voice so that even lucilla found it a little difficult to keep her gravity
but then miss marjoribanks was defended by her mission and she felt in her heart that representing public interest as she did it was her duty to avoid all complicity in any attack upon an individual and consequently to a certain extent it was her duty also to put mrs woodburn down
molly brown has a very nice little voice said lucilla with most disheartening gravity
i like to hear her sing for my partthe only thing is that she wants cultivation a little
it doesn't matter much you know whether or not you have a voice to begin with
it is cultivation that is the thing said miss marjoribanks deliberately
i hope you really thought it was a pleasant evening
of course everybody said so to me but then one can never put any faith in that
i have said it myself ever so many times when i am sure i did not mean it
for myself i don't give any importance to the first evening
anybody can do a thing once you know the second and the third and so onthat is the real test
but i hope you thought it pleasant so far as it went
it was a great deal more than pleasant said mr cavendish and as for your conception of social politics it is masterly the future mp
added in a tone which struck lucilla as very significant not that she cared particularly about mr cavendish's meaning but still when a young man who intends to go into parliament congratulates a young lady upon her statesmanlike views and her conception of politics it must be confessed that it looks a little particular and then if that was what he meant it was no doubt lucilla's duty to make up her mind
oh you know i went through a course of political economy at mount pleasant she said with a laugh
one of the miss blounts was dreadfully strongminded
i wonder for my part that she did not make me literary but fortunately i escaped that
heaven be praised
said mr cavendish
i think you ought to be prime minister
that contralto of yours is charming raw material but if i were you i would put her through an elementary course
she knows how to sing but she does not know how to move and as for talking she seems to expect to be insulted
if you make a prettybehaved young lady out of that you will beat adam smith
oh i don't know much about adam smith said miss marjoribanks
i think miss martha thought him rather oldfashioned
as for poor barbara she is only a little shy but that will soon wear off
i don't see what need she has to talkor to move either for that matter
i thought she did very well indeed for a girl who never goes into society
was it not clever of me to find her out the very first day i was in carlingford
it has always been so difficult to find a voice that went perfectly with mine
for my part i think it was a great deal more than clever said mr cavendish for mrs woodburn finding herself unappreciated was silent and making notes
it was a stroke of genius
so her name is barbara
i wonder if it would be indiscreet to ask where mademoiselle barbara comes from or if she belongs to anybody or lives anywhere
my own impression is that you mean to keep her shut up in a box all the week through and produce her only on the thursday evenings
i have a weakness for a fine contralto
if she had been existing in an ordinary habitation like other people in carlingford i should have heard her or heard of her
it is clear to me that you keep her shut up in a box
exactly said lucilla
i don't mean to tell you anything about her
you may be sure now i have found her out i mean to keep her for myself
her box is quite a pretty one like what gulliver had somewhere
it is just time for lunch and you are both going to stay i hope and there is poor mary chiley and her husband coming through the garden
what a pity it is he is such a goose
yes but you know she never would take her uncle's advice my dear said the incorrigible mimic putting on mrs chiley's face and being an orphan what could anybody do
and then she does not get on with his family
by the way mrs woodburn said falling into her natural tonei wonder if anybody ever does get on with her husband's family
the question was one which was a little grave to herself at the moment and this was the reason why she returned to her identityfor there was no telling how long the woodburns who had come for christmas meant to stay
i shall be quite interested to watch you lucilla when it comes to be your turn and see how you manage she went on with a keen look at miss marjoribanks and mr cavendish laughed
he too looked at her and lucilla felt herself in rather a delicate position not that she was agitated as might have been the case had the future mp
for carlingford engaged her affections as she herself would have said
fortunately these young affections were quite free as yet but nevertheless miss marjoribanks felt that the question was a serious one as coming from the sister of a gentleman who was undeniably paying her attention
she did not in the least wish to alarm a leading member of a family into which it was possible she might enter and then at the same time she intended to reserve fully all her individual rights
i always make it a point never to shock anybody's prejudices said miss marjoribanks
i should do just the same with them as with other people all you have to do is to show from the first that you mean to be good friends with everybody
but then i am so lucky i can always get on with people said lucilla rising to greet the two unfortunates who had come to colonel chiley's to spend a merry christmas and who did not know what to do with themselves
and then they all went downstairs and lunched together very pleasantly
as for mr cavendish he was quite devoted as poor mary chiley said with a touch of envy
to be sure her trousseau was still in its full glory but yet life under the conditions of marriage was not nearly such fun as it had been when she was a young lady and had some one paying attention to her and she rather grudged lucilla that climax of existence notwithstanding her own superior standing and dignity as a married lady
and mrs woodburn too awoke from her study of the stupid young husband to remark upon her brother's behaviour she had not seen the two together so often as mrs chiley had done and consequently this was the first time that the thought had occurred to her
she too had been born one of the cavendishes as it was common to say in carlingford with a certain imposing yet vague grandeurand she was a little shocked like any good sister at the first idea
she watched lucilla's movements and looks with a quite different kind of attention after this idea struck her and made a rapid private calculation as to who dr marjoribanks's connections were and what he would be likely to give his daughter so that it is evident that lucilla did not deceive herself but that mr cavendish's attentions must have been marked indeed
this was the little cloud which arose as we have said no bigger than a man's hand over miss marjoribanks's prosperous way
when the luncheon was over and they had all gone lucilla took a few minutes to think it over before she went out
it was not that she was unduly flattered by mr cavendish's attentions as might have happened to an inexperienced young woman for lucilla with her attractions and genius had not reached the mature age of nineteen without receiving the natural homage of mankind on several clearlydefined occasions
but then the present case had various features peculiar to itself which prevented lucilla from crushing it in the bud as she had meant to do with her cousin's illfated passion
she had to consider in the first place her mission in carlingford which was more important than anything else but though miss marjoribanks had vowed herself to the reorganisation of society in her native town she had not by any means vowed that it was absolutely as miss marjoribanks that she was to accomplish that renovation
and then there was something in the very idea of being mp
for carlingford which moved the mind of lucilla
it was a perfectly ideal position for a woman of her views and seemed to offer the very field that was necessary for her ambition
this was the reason of all others which made her less careful to prevent mr cavendish from saying the words than she had been with tom
to be sure it would be a trial to leave the drawingroom after it had just been furnished so entirely to her likingnot to say to her complexion but still it was a sacrifice which might be made
it was in this way that miss marjoribanks prepared herself for the possible modifications which circumstances might impose
she did not make any rash resolution to resist a change which on the whole might possibly be for the best but prepared herself to take everything into consideration and possibly to draw from it a superior good in short she looked upon the matter as a superior mind trained in sound principles of political economy might be expected to look upon the possible vicissitudes of fortune with an enlightened regard to the uses of all things and to the comparative values on either side
barbara lake as it happened was out walking at the very moment when miss marjoribanks sat down to consider this question
she had gone to the school of design to meet rose with an amiability very unusual in her
rose had made such progress after leaving mount pleasant under her father's care and by the help of that fine feeling for art which has been mentioned in the earlier part of this history that the charge of the female pupils in the school of design had been confided to her with a tiny little salary which served mr lake as an excuse for keeping his favourite little daughter with him
nothing could be supposed more unlike barbara than her younger sister who just came up to her shoulder and was twice as serviceable and active and nice according to the testimony of all the children
barbara had led her father a hard life poor man
the time that rose was at mount pleasant but now that his assistant had come back again the poor drawingmaster had recovered all his old spirits
she was just coming out of the school of design with her portfolio under her arm when barbara met her
there were not many pupils it is true but still there were enough to worry poor rose who was not an imposing personage and who was daily wounded by the discovery that after all there are but a limited number of persons in this world especially in the poorer classes of the community and under the age of sixteen who have a feeling for art
it was utterly inconceivable to the young teacher how her girls could be so clever as to find out each a different way of putting the sublime features of the belveder apollo out of drawing and she was still revolving this difficult problem when her sister joined her
barbara for her part was occupied with thoughts of a hero much more interesting than he of olympus
she was flushed and eager and looking very handsome under her shabby bonnet and her anxiety to have a confidante was so great that she made a dart at rose and grasped her by the arm under which she was carrying her portfolio to the great discomposure of the young artist
she asked with a little anxiety what is the matter
is there anything wrong at home
and made a rapid movement to get to the other side
oh rose said barbara panting with haste and agitation only fancy i have just seen him
i met him right in front of masters's and he took off his hat to me
i feel in such a wayi can scarcely speak
metwho
said rosefor she was imperfect in her grammar like most people in a moment of emergency and besides she shared to some extent miss marjoribanks's reluctance to shock the prejudices of society and was disturbed by the idea that somebody might pass and see barbara in her present state of excitement and perhaps attribute it to its true cause
oh you stupid little thing
said barbara giving her a shake by her disengaged arm
i tell you himthe gentleman i met at lucilla marjoribanks's
he looked as if he was quite delighted to see me again and i am sure he turned round to see where i was going
he couldn't speak to me you know the first time though indeed i shouldn't be the least surprised if he had followedat a distance you know only to see where i live said barbara turning round and searching into the distance with her eager eyes
but there was nobody to be seen in the street except some of rose's pupils lingering along in the sunshine and very probably exchanging similar confidences
barbara turned back again with a touch of disappointment
i am quite sure he will find out before long and don't forget i said so she added with a little nod of her head
i don't see what it matters if he found out directly said rose
papa would not let anybody come to our house that he did not approve of and then you know he will never have anything to say to people who are patronising
i don't want to hear any more about your fine gentleman
if you were worried as i am you would think much more of getting home than of anybody bowing to you in the street
one of the gentlemen from marlborough house once took off his hat to me said rose with a certain solemnity
of course i was pleased but then i knew it was my design he was thinking ofmy honiton flounce you know
i suppose this other one must have thought you had a pretty voice
this time however it was an angry shake that barbara gave to her sister
i wish you would not be such a goose she said who cares about your honiton flounce
he took off his hat becausebecause he admired me i supposeand then it was a great deal more than just taking off his hat
he gave me such a look
papa has no sense though i suppose you will blaze up when i say so
he ought to think of us a little
as for patronising i should soon change that i can tell you
but then papa thinks of nothing but paying his bills and keeping out of debt as he saysas if everybody was not in debt and how do you suppose we are ever to get settled in life
it would be far more sensible to spend a little more and go into society a little and do us justice
only think all that that old doctor is doing for lucilla and there are four of us when the little ones grow up said barbara in a tone of injury
i should like to know what papa is thinking of
if mamma had not died when she did  it was not poor mamma's fault said rose
i dare say she would have lived if she could for all our sakes
but then you have always taken a false view of our position barbara
we are a family of artists said the little mistress of the school of design
she had pretty eyes very dewy and clear and they woke up under the excitement of this proud claim
when papa is appreciated as he deserves and when willie has made a name said rose with modest confidence things will be different
but the true strength of our position is that we are a family of artists
we are everybody's equal and we are nobody's equal
we have a rank of our own
if you would only remember this you would not grudge anything to lucilla marjoribanks and then i am sure she has been very kind to you
oh bother
said the unfeeling barbara
you do nothing but encourage papa with your nonsense
and i should like to know what right lucilla marjoribanks has to be kind to me
if i am not as good as she it is a very strange thing
i should never take the trouble to think about him if it was not that lucilla believes he is paying her attentionthat is the great fun
it would be delicious to take him from her and make game of her and her kindness
goodness
there he is again
i felt sure that he would try to find out the house
and barbara crimsoned higher than ever and held rose fast by the arm and called her attention by the most visible and indeed tangible signs to the elegant apparition like any other underbred young woman
as for rose she was a little gentlewoman born and had a horror unspeakable of her sister's bad manners
when mr cavendish made a movement as if to address barbara it was the pretty gray eyes of rose lifted to his face with a look of straightforward surprise and inquiry which made him retire so hastily
he took off his hat again more respectfully than before and pursued his walk along grove street as if he had no ulterior intention in visiting that humble part of the town
as for barbara she held rose faster than ever and almost pinched her arm to make her listen
i knew he was trying to find out the house she said in an exultant whisper
and lucilla thinks he is paying her attention
for the fact was that when miss marjoribanks took to being kind to barbara she conferred upon the contralto at the same moment a palpable injury and grievance which was what the drawingmaster's daughter had been looking for for several years of her life
and naturally lucilla who was at this moment thinking it all over under the soft green shadows from her new hangings was deprived of the light which might have been thrown on her reflections had she seen what was going on in grove street
the conditions of humanity are such that even a woman of genius cannot altogether overstep them
and lucilla still continued to think that mr cavendish was paying her attention which indeed was also the general opinion in grange lane
chapter xii   the second of her thursday evenings found miss marjoribanks though secure perhaps more anxious than on the former occasion
the charm of the first novelty was gone and lucilla did not feel quite sure that her subjects had the good sense to recognise all the benefits which she was going to confer upon them
it is the second time that counts she said in confidence to mrs chiley
last thursday they wanted to see the drawingroom and they wanted to know what sort of thing it was to be
dear mrs chiley it is tonight that is the test said lucilla giving a nervous pressure to her old friend's hand at least a pressure that would have betokened the existence of nerves in any one else but miss marjoribanks whose magnificent organisation was beyond any suspicion of such weakness
but nevertheless mrs chiley who watched her with grandmotherly interest was comforted to perceive that lucilla as on the former occasion had strength of mind to eat her dinner
she wants a little support poor dear the old lady said in her heart for she was a kinder critic than the younger matrons who felt instinctively that miss marjoribanks was doing what they ought to have done
she took her favourite's arm in hers as they went upstairs and gave mr cavendish a kindly nod as he opened the door for them
he will come and give you his assistance as soon as ever he can get away from the gentlemen said mrs chiley in her consolatory tone but good gracious lucilla what is the matter
the cause of this exclamation was a universal hum and rustle as of many dresses and many voices and to tell the truth when miss marjoribanks and her companion reached the top of the stairs they found themselves lost in a laughing crowd which had taken refuge on the landing
there is no room lucilla
lucilla everybody in carlingford is here
do make a little room for us in the drawingroom cried this overplus of society
if there was an enviable woman in carlingford at that moment it certainly was miss marjoribanks standing on the top of her own stairs scarcely able to penetrate through the throng of her guests
her selfpossession did not forsake her at this supreme moment
she grasped mrs chiley once again with a little significant gesture which pleased the old lady for she could not but feel that she was lucilla's only confidante in her brilliant but perilous undertaking
they will not be able to get in when they come upstairs said miss marjoribanks and whether the faint inflection in her voice meant exultation or disappointment her old friend could not tell
but the scene changed when the rightful sovereign entered the gay but disorganised dominion where her subjects attended her
before any one knew how it was done miss marjoribanks had reestablished order and what was still more important made room
she said you girls have no business to get into corners
the corners are for the people that can talk
it is one of my principles always to flirt in the middle of the company said lucilla and again as happened so often ignorant people laughed and thought it a bon mot
but it is needless to inform the more intelligent persons who understand miss marjoribanks that it was by no means a bon mot but expressed lucilla's convictions with the utmost sincerity
thus it happened that the second thursday was more brilliant and infinitely more gratifying than the first had been
for one thing she felt sure that it was not to see the new furniture nor to criticise this new sort of entertainment but with the sincerest intention of enjoying themselves that all the people had come and there are moments when the egotism of the public conveys the highest compliment that can be paid to the great minds which take in hand to rule and to amuse it
the only drawback was that barbara lake did not show the same modesty and reticence as on the former occasion
far from being sensibly silent which she had been so prudent as to be on miss marjoribanks's first thursday she forgot herself so far as to occupy a great deal of mr cavendish's valuable time which he might have employed much more usefully
she not only sang by herself when he asked her having brought some music with her unseen by lucilla but she kept her seat upon the stool before the piano ever so long afterwards detaining him and as miss marjoribanks had very little doubt making an exhibition of herself for barbara having received one good gift from nature had been refused the other and could not talk
when lucilla arrested in the midst of her many occupations heard her protge's voice rising alone she stopped quite short with an anxiety which it was touching to behold
it was not the jealousy of a rival cantatrice which inspired miss marjoribanks's countenance but the far broader and grander anxiety of an accomplished statesman who sees a rash and untrained hand meddling with his most delicate machinery
lucilla ignored everything for the momenther own voice and mr cavendish's attentions and every merely secondary and personal emotion
all these details were swallowed up in the fear that barbara would not acquit herself as it was necessary for the credit of the house that she should acquit herself that she should not sing well enough or that she should sing too much
once more miss marjoribanks put her finger upon the pulse of the community as she and they listened together
fortunately things went so far well that barbara sang her very best and kept up her prestige but it was different in the second particular for unluckily the contralto knew a great many songs and showed no inclination to stop
nothing remained for it but a bold coup which lucilla executed with all her natural coolness and success
my dear barbara she said putting her hands on the singer's shoulders as she finished her strain that is enough for tonight
mr cavendish will take you downstairs and get you a cup of tea for you know there is no room tonight to serve it upstairs
thus miss marjoribanks proved herself capable of preferring her great work to her personal sentiments which is generally considered next to impossible for a woman
she did what perhaps nobody else in the room was capable of doing she sent away the gentleman who was paying attention to her in company with the girl who was paying attention to him and at that moment as was usual when she was excited barbara was splendid with her crimson cheeks and the eyes blazing out from under her level eyebrows
this miss marjoribanks did not in ignorance but with a perfect sense of what she was about
it was the only way of preventing her evening from losing its distinctive character
it was the lamp of sacrifice which lucilla had now to employ and she proved herself capable of the exertion
but it would be hopeless to attempt to describe the indignation of old mrs chiley or the unmitigated amazement of the company in general which was conscious at the same time that mr cavendish was paying attention to miss marjoribanks and that he had been flirting in an inexcusable manner with miss lake
my dear i would have nothing to do with that bold girl mrs chiley said in lucilla's ear
i will go down and look after them if you like
a girl like that always leads the gentlemen astray you know
i never liked the looks of her
let me go downstairs and look after them my dear
i am sure i want a cup of tea
you shall have a cup of tea dear mrs chiley said miss marjoribankssome of them will bring you one but i can't let you take any trouble about barbara
she had to be stopped you know or she would have turned us into a musical party and as for mr cavendish he is the best assistant i have
there are so few men in carlingford who can flirt said lucilla regretfully
her eyes fell as she spoke upon young osmond brown who was actually at that moment talking to mr bury's curate with a disregard of his social duties painful to contemplate
poor osmond started when he met miss marjoribanks's reproachful eye
but then i don't know how said the disconcerted youthand he flushed poor boy being only eighteen and not much more than a schoolboy
as for lucilla who had no intention of putting up with that sort of thing she sent off the curate summarily for mrs chiley's cup of tea
i did not mean you my dear osy she said in her motherly tone
when you are a little older we shall see what you can do but you are not at all disagreeable for a boy she added encouragingly and took osmond's arm as she made her progress down the room with an indulgence worthy of her maturer years and even mrs centum and mrs woodburn and the miss browns who were in a manner lucilla's natural rivals could not but be impressed with this evidence of her powers
they were like the tuscan chivalry in the ballad who could scarce forbear a cheer at the sight of their opponent's prowess
perhaps nothing that she could have done would have so clearly demonstrated the superiority of her genius to her female audience as that bold step of stopping the music which began to be too much by sending off the singer downstairs under charge of mr cavendish
to be sure the men did not even find out what it was that awoke the ladies' attention but then in delicate matters of social politics one never expects to be understood by them
barbara lake as was to be expected took a very long time over her cup of tea and even when she returned upstairs she made another pause on the landing which was still kept possession of by a lively stream of young people coming and going
barbara had very little experience and she was weak enough to believe that mr cavendish lingered there to have a little more of her society all to himself but to tell the truth his sentiments were of a very different description
for by this time it must be owned that barbara's admirer began to feel a little ashamed of himself
he could not but be conscious of lucilla's magnanimity and at the same time he was very well aware that his return with his present companion would be watched and noted and made the subject of comment a great deal more amusing than agreeable
when he did take barbara in at last it was with a discomfited air which tickled the spectators beyond measure
and as his evil luck would have it notwithstanding the long pause he had made on the landing to watch his opportunity of entering unobserved miss marjoribanks was the first to encounter the returning couple
they met full in the face a few paces from the doorexactly as mrs chiley said as if it had been mr and mrs cavendish on their wedding visit and the lady of the house had gone to meet them
as for the unfortunate gentleman he could not have looked more utterly disconcerted and guilty if he had been convicted of putting the spoons in his pocket or of having designs upon the silver teaservice
he found a seat for his companion with all the haste possible and instead of lingering by her side as she had anticipated made off on the instant and hid himself like a criminal in the dark depths of a group of men who were talking together near the door
these were men who were hopeless and good for nothing but to talk to each other and whom miss marjoribanks tolerated in her drawingroom partly because their wives with an excusable weakness insisted on bringing them and partly because they made a foil to the brighter part of the company and served as a butt when anybody wanted to be witty
as for lucilla she made no effort to recall the truant from the ranks of the incurables
it was the only vengeance she took upon his desertion
when he came to take leave of her she was standing with her hand in that of mrs chiley who was also going away
i confess i was a little nervous this evening miss marjoribanks was saying
you know it is always the second that is the test
but i think on the whole it has gone off very well
mr cavendish you promised to tell me the truth for you know i have great confidence in your judgment
tell me sincerely do you think it has been a pleasant evening
lucilla said with a beautiful earnestness looking him in the face
the guilty individual to whom this question was addressed felt disposed to sink into the earth if the earth in the shape of mr holden's beautiful new carpet would but have opened to receive him but after all that was perhaps not a thing to be desired under the circumstances
mr cavendish however was a man of resources and not disposed to give up the contest without striking a blow in his own defence
not so pleasant as last thursday he said
i am not fit to be a lady's adviser for i am too sincere but i incline to think it is the third that is the test said the future mp
 and lucilla made him as mrs chiley remarked the most beautiful curtsey but then nothing could be more delightful than the manner in which that dear girl behaved through the whole affair
if everybody would only help me as you do
said miss marjoribanks
goodnight i am so sorry you have not enjoyed yourself
but then it is such a consolation to meet with people that are sincere
and i think on the whole it has gone off very well for the second said lucilla though i say it that should not say it
the fact was it had gone off so well that the house could hardly be cleared of the amiable and satisfied guests
a series of the most enthusiastic compliments were paid to lucilla as she stood in state in the middle of the room and bade everybody goodbye
next thursday she said with the benevolent grace of an acknowledged sovereign
and when they were all gone miss marjoribanks's reflections as she stood alone in the centre of her domains were of a nature very different from the usual reflections which the giver of a feast is supposed to make when all is over
but then as everybody is aware it was not a selfish desire for personal pleasure nor any scheme of worldly ambition which moved the mind of lucilla
with such motives it is only natural that the conclusion all is vanity should occur to the weary entertainer in the midst of his withered flowers and extinguished lights
such ideas had nothing in common with the enlightened conceptions of miss marjoribanks
perhaps it would be false to say that she had suffered in the course of this second thursday or that a superior intelligence like lucilla's could permit itself to feel any jealousy of barbara lake but it would be vain to deny that she had been surprised
and any one who knows miss marjoribanks will acknowledge that a great deal was implied in that confession
but then she had triumphed over the weakness and triumphantly proved that her estimate of the importance of her work went far beyond the influence of mere personal feeling
in these circumstances lucilla could contemplate her withered flowers with perfect calmness without any thought that all was vanity
but then the fact was miss marjoribanks was accomplishing a great public duty and at the same time had the unspeakable consolation of knowing that she had proved herself a comfort to her dear papa
the doctor it is true after looking on for a little with a halfamused consciousness that his own assistance was totally unnecessary had gradually veered into a corner and from thence had finally managed to escape downstairs to his beloved library
but then the sense of security and tranquillity with which he established himself at the fire undisturbed by the gay storm that raged outside gave a certain charm to his retirement
he rubbed his hands and listened as a man listens to the wind howling out of doors when he is in shelter and comfort
so that after all lucilla's sensation of having accomplished her filial duties in the most effective manner was to a certain extent justified while at the same time it is quite certain that nobody missed dr marjoribanks from the pleasant assembly upstairs
chapter xiii   it was thus that the reign of miss marjoribanks became gradually established and confirmed in carlingford
it would be unnecessary to enter into detail or to redouble instances of that singular genius which made itself so fully felt to the furthest limits of society and which even indeed extended those limits miraculously beyond the magic circle of grange lane
lucilla's powers beguiled not only the powells and sir john richmond's family who were as everybody knows fully entitled to be called county people and came only on the thursdays when there was moonlight to light them home which was not so much to be wondered at since county society in those parts was unusually heavy at that period but even what was more extraordinary miss marjoribanks made a lodgment in the enemy's country on the other side and made a capture of all people in the world of john brown who lived in his father's big old house at the town end of george street and had always laughed in his cynical way at the pretensions of grange lane
but then lucilla had as all the ladies admitted an influence over the gentlemen of which as was natural they were slightly contemptuous even if perhaps envious to some extent of the gift
for everybody knows that it requires very little to satisfy the gentlemen if a woman will only give her mind to it
as for miss marjoribanks herself she confessed frankly that she did her best to please them
for you know after all in carlingford one is obliged to take them into consideration she said with a natural apology
so many of you poor dear people have to go where they like and see the people they want you to see miss marjoribanks added fluttering her maiden plumes with a certain disdainful pity in the very eyes of mrs centum and mrs woodburn who were well aware both of them at the bottom of their hearts that but for dr marjoribanks's dinners their selfish mates would find infinite objections to the thursday evening which was now an institution in carlingford
and lucilla knew it just as well as they did which gave a certain sense of condescension and superiority to her frankness
i never pretend i don't try to please them miss marjoribanks said and the matrons found themselves worsted as usual for to be sure it was not for them but for the good of the community in general that lucilla exerted herself so successfully
nothing indeed could have proved more completely the disinterested character of miss marjoribanks's proceedings than her behaviour in respect to mr cavendish
after the bold and decisive action taken by lucilla on the first occasion when the flirtation between him and barbara lake became apparent the misguided young man returned to a better frame of mind perhaps out of admiration for her magnanimity perhaps attracted by her indifference as is the known and ascertained weakness of the gentlemen
and perhaps also mr cavendish was ashamed of himself as in mrs chiley's opinion at least he had so much reason to be
anyhow whatever the cause he behaved himself with the profoundest decorum for several weeks in succession and treated the contralto with such overwhelming politeness as reduced poor barbara out of her momentary exultation into the depths of humiliation and despair
mr cavendish was lucilla's right hand for that short but virtuous period and fully justified miss marjoribanks's opinion which was founded at once upon reflection and experience that to have a man who can flirt is next thing to indispensable to a leader of society that is to say if he is under efficient discipline and capable of carrying out a grand conception
everything went on delightfully so long as this interval lasted and lucilla herself did not disdain to recompense her faithful assistant by bestowing upon him various little privileges such as naturally appertain to a subject whose place is on the steps of the throne
she took him into her confidence and made him to a certain extent a party to her large and philanthropic projects and even now and then accepted a suggestion from him with that true candour and modesty which so often accompany administrative genius
while this continued kind old mrs chiley kept caressing them both in her oldwomanly way
she even went so far as to call mr cavendish my dear as if he had been a grandson of her own and took her afternoon drive in her little brougham past his house with a genial sense of prospective property through lucilla which was wonderfully pleasant
to be sure there was not very much known in carlingford about his connections but then everybody was aware that he was one of the cavendishes and the people who are not content with that must be hard indeed to please
as for mrs woodburn she it was true continued to take off miss marjoribanks but then as mrs chiley justly remarked she was a woman who would take off the archbishop of canterbury or the virgin mary if she had the opportunity and there was no fear but lucilla if once married would soon bring her to her senses and then mr chiltern grew more and more feeble and was scarcely once in a fortnight in his place in parliament which was a sacrifice of the interests of the borough dreadful to contemplate
and thus it was in the interests of lucilla notwithstanding that ladies are not eligible for election under such circumstances that mrs chiley carried on a quiet little canvass for the future mp
all this lasted alas
only too short a time
after a while the level eyebrows and flashing eyes and magnificent voice of barbara lake began to reassert their ancient power
whatever may be the predisposition of the cavendishes in general this particular member of the race was unable to resist these influences
barbara had managed to persuade rose to persuade her father that it was necessary for her to have a new dress and mr lake was more persuadable than usual being naturally pleased to be complimented when he went to give his lessons on his daughter's beautiful voice
her talent has taken another development from ours he said with his little air of dignity but still she has the artist temperament
all my children have been brought up to love the beautiful and this argument had of course all the more effect upon him when repeated by his favourite daughter
and then barbara has such a noble head said rose when nobody is looking at her she always makes a fine composition
to be sure when she is observed she gets awkward and puts herself out of drawing but that is not to be wondered at
i don't want her to be fine or to imitate the grange lane people but then you know papa you always say that we have a rank of our own being a family of artists said rose holding up her little head with a pretty arrogance which delighted the father both in a paternal and a professional point of view
if one could only have made a study of her at that moment he said to himself regretfully and he consented to barbara's dress
as for the contralto whose sentiments were very different from those of her father and sister she watched over the making of the robe thus procured with a certain jealous care which nobody unacquainted with the habits of a family of artists could understand
barbara's talent was not sufficiently developed to permit of her making it herself but she knew already by sad experience that rose's views of what was picturesque in costume were peculiar and not always successful
and then it was only a new dress to rose whereas to barbara it was a supreme effort of passion and ambition and jealousy and wounded amour propre
mr cavendish had paid a great deal of attention to her and she had naturally entertained dreams of the wildest and most magnificent characterof riding in her carriage as she would herself have said and dressing as nobody else dressed in carlingford and becoming the great lady of the town and eclipsing utterly lucilla marjoribanks who had been so impertinent as to patronise her
such had been barbara's delicious dreams for a whole fortnight and then mr cavendish who had taken her up put her down again and went away from her side and delivered himself over heart and soul to the service of lucilla
barbara had no intellect to speak of but she had what she called a heartthat is to say a vital centre of inclinations and passions all of which were set in motion by that intense force of selfregard which belongs to some of the lower organisations
thus she arrayed herself not in simple muslin but in all the power of fascination which a strong will and fixed purpose can add to beauty
and in her excitement and with the sense she had that this was her opportunity and that advancement and grandeur depended upon the result of her night's work her level eyebrows and flushing cheeks and black intense eyes rose almost into positive beauty
there was nobody in the room to compare with her when she stood up to sing on that memorable evening
the miss browns for example were very pretty especially lydia who was afterwards married to young richmond sir john's eldest son and they were much nicer girls and far more engaging than barbara lake who was not even a lady mrs chiley said
but then her determination though it was a poor enough thing in itself gave a certain glow and passion to her coarser beauty
when she stood up to sing the whole room was struck with her appearance
she had her new dress on and though it was only white muslin like other people's it gave her the air of a priestess inspired by some approaching crisis and sweeping forward upon the victim who was ready to be sacrificed
and yet the victim that night was far from being ready for the sacrifice
on the contrary he had been thinking it all over and had concluded that prudence and every other reasonable sentiment were on the other side and that in many ways it would be a very good thing for him if he could persuade miss marjoribanks to preside over and share his fortunes
he had made up his mind to this with all the more certainty that he was a man habitually prone to run off after everything that attracted him in direct opposition to prudencean inclination which he shared with his sister who as everybody knew had ruined poor mr woodburn's fortunes by taking off before his very face the only rich uncle in the woodburn family
mr cavendish with this wise resolution in his mind stood up in the very path of the contralto as she followed miss marjoribanks to the piano and confident in his determination even allowed himself to meet her eyewhich was rash to say the least of it
barbara flashed upon him as she passed a blaze of intense oblique lightning from under her level browsor perhaps it was only that straight black line which made it look obliqueand then went on to her place
the result was such as might have been anticipated from the character of the man
barbara was in richer voice than ever before and all but obliterated even lucilla though she too was singing her best and thus poor mr cavendish again fell into the snare
that very night the flirtation which had already created so much talk was resumed with more energy than ever and barbara took miss marjoribanks's place at the piano and sang song after song in a kind of intoxication of triumph
this to be sure was visible only to a small portion of the guests who crowded lucilla's drawingroom
but the result was soon so visible that all carlingford became aware of it
the hero wavered so much that the excitement was kept up for many weeks but still from the first nobody could have any reasonable doubt as to how it was to end
and it was while this process of seduction was going on that the character of miss marjoribanks revealed itself in all its native grandeur
lucilla had various kind friends round her to advise her and especially old mrs chiley whose indignation went beyond all bounds
my dear i would never let her enter my door againnever
cried the old lady i told you long ago i never could bear her looksyou know i warned you lucilla
as for her singing what does it matter
you have a much prettier voice than she has everybody knows that a soprano is perfect by itself but a contralto is only a second mrs chiley said with mingled wrath and satisfaction and my dear i should never let her enter my house again if it was me
dear mrs chiley said lucilla who was now as usual equal to the occasion it is so nice of you to be vexed
you know i would do anything to please youbut after all there are thousands and thousands of gentlemen and it is not so easy to find a voice that goes with mine
all my masters always said it was a quite peculiar second i wanted and suppose barbara is foolish that is not to say i should forget my duties miss marjoribanks added with a certain solemnity and then you know she has no mother to keep her right
and neither have you my poor dear said mrs chiley kissing her protge
as for lucilla she accepted the kiss but repressed the enthusiasm of partisanship with which her cause was being maintained
i have you she said with artless gratitude and then i am different added lucilla
nothing but modesty of the most delicate description could have expressed the fact with such a fine reticence
no doubt miss marjoribanks was different and she proved her superiority if anybody could have doubted it by the most beautiful behaviour
she took no more notice of the unprincipled flirtation thus set agoing under her very eyes than if mr cavendish and barbara lake had been two figures in gingerbread
so far as anybody knew not even a flying female shaft from lucilla's bow one of those dainty projectiles which the best of women cast forth by times had ever been directed against the ungrateful young person who had made so unprincipled a use of her admittance into grange lane and the faithless gallant had not even the gratification of feeling that lucilla was cool to him
whether this singular selfdenial cost miss marjoribanks any acute sufferings nobody could tell but mrs chiley still marked with satisfaction that lucilla poor dear was able to eat her dinner of which she had so much need to support her strength and after she had eaten her dinner miss marjoribanks would go upstairs and show herself just as usual
she was in perfect voice and neither lost her colour nor grew thin nor showed any of those external signs of a disappointment in love with which most people are familiar
it might have been different you know if my affections had been engaged she said to her sole and sympathising counsellor and mrs chiley who had had a great deal of experience in girls became more and more of opinion that such sense was all but superhuman
meantime the tide of public opinion ran very high in carlingford against mr cavendish who had been so popular a little while before
if it had been one of the miss browns or a niece of the colonel's or indeed anybody in grange lane people might have passed over itbut one of mr lake the drawingmaster's daughters
the only person indifferent was mrs woodburn who ought to have known better but then she was thoughtless like her brother and liked it all the better on the whole that he should transfer those attentions which he had been paying to miss marjoribanks and which in that quarter must have come to something to a little harmless amusement with barbara who after all was very handsome and had by times a little air of obdurate stupidity which captivated the mimic
as for anything coming of that mrs woodburn rejected the idea with a simplicity which was perfectly consistent with her insight into other people's weaknesses
she could put on barbara's stolid defiant look and even make her eyebrows square and give something of an oblique gleam to her eyes with the most perfect skill and mastery of the character and at the same time be just as stolid as barbara in respect to what was going on at her very hand and to the consequences which must follow
she did not want her brother to marry miss marjoribanks and yet she could not have said a word against so unexceptionable a match and accordingly it was quite a satisfaction to her to see him turned aside in so perfectly legitimate a manner
she added to her repertory a sketch of barbara at the moment when yielding to mr cavendish's entreaties she seated herself at the piano for just one song and being perfectly successful in the representation mrs woodburn took no further care about the matter
to be sure the hero was sufficiently experienced in such matters to know how to get out of it when it should be the proper time
thus the affair progressed which was to have far more serious consequences than these thoughtless persons dreamed of
barbara ascended again to the heights of exultation and enchantment
perhaps she was even a little in love for after all she was young and grateful to the man who thus distinguished her from the world
yet on the whole it is to be feared that his house and his position in society and the prospect of unlimited millinery were more to her than mr cavendish
all these details were not perhaps contemplated by himself as he devoted himself to the handsome contralto
he had not begun to dream as barbara had done for a long time of the wedding breakfast and the orange blossoms or even of furnishing a new drawingroom handsomer than miss marjoribanks's and giving parties which should be real parties and not mere thursdays
none of these imaginations occupied mr cavendish as he followed barbara's glowing cheeks and flashing eyes to his undoing
but then if he did not mean it she meant it and after all there are occasions in which the woman's determination is the more important of the two
so that taking everything into consideration there can be no doubt that it was very fortunate that lucilla's affections were not engaged
she behaved as nobody else in carlingford was capable of behaving and very few people anywhere according to mrs chiley's admiring belief
it was not for a vulgar antagonist like barbara lake to touch lucilla
the way in which she asked her to lunch and went on practising duets with her was angelicalit brought the tears to mrs chiley's eyes and as for the domestic traitor whom miss marjoribanks thus contrived to warm in her magnanimous bosom she was sometimes so full of spite and disappointment that she could neither eat her lunch nor go on with her singing
for to be sure the dearest climax of her triumph was wanting so long as lucilla took no notice and so far from taking any notice miss marjoribanks was sweeter and more friendly than usual in her serene unconsciousness
i am so afraid you have caught cold lucilla would say if you don't feel clear in your lower notes we can pass over this passage you know for today
you must see papa before you go away and he will order you something but my dear barbara you must take care
and then barbara could have eaten her fingers instead of the gloves which she kept biting in her vexation
for to tell the truth if miss marjoribanks was not jealous the victory was but half a victory after all
chapter xiv   it was thus that miss marjoribanks went through all the preliminary stages and succeeded finally in making a triumph out of what would certainly have been a defeat and a humbling defeat for anybody else
she was much too sensible to deceive herself on the subject or not to be aware that to have a gentleman who was paying attention to her withdrawn from her side in this open manner in the sight of all the world was as trying an accident as can happen to a woman
fortunately as lucilla said her affections were not engaged but then apart from the affections there are other sentiments which demand consideration
everybody in carlingford knew that mr cavendish had been paying her a great deal of attention and the situation was one which required the most delicate skill to get through it successfully
besides miss marjoribanks's circumstances were all the more difficult since up to this moment she had been perfectly sincere and natural in all her proceedings
policy had been constantly inspired and backed by nature in the measures lucilla had taken for the organisation and welfare of her kingdom and even what people took for the cleverest calculation was in reality a succession of happy instincts by means of which with the sovereignty of true genius miss marjoribanks managed to please everybody by having her own way
a little victory is almost necessary to begin with and it is a poor nature that does not expand under the stimulus of victory but now the young reformer had come to the second stage
for to be sure that sort of thing cannot last for ever and this lucilla with the natural prevision of a ruling mind had foreseen from the beginning
the shape in which she had feared defeat if a nature so full of resources could ever be said to fear was that of a breakdown when all the world was looking to her for amusement or the sudden appearance of a rival entertainer in carlingford with superior powers though the last was but a dim and improbable danger the first was quite possible and might have arrived at any moment
miss marjoribanks was much too sensible not to have foreseen this danger in all its shapes and even in a kind of way to have provided against it
but providence which had always taken care of her as lucilla piously concluded had spared her the trial in that form
up to this moment it had always providentially happened that all the principal people in carlingford were quite well and disengaged on the evening
to be sure the ladies had headaches and the married gentlemen now and then were out of temper in grange lane as in other less favoured places but these social accidents had been mercifully averted on thursdays perhaps by means of some special celestial agency perhaps only through that goodluck which had been born with lucilla
not in this vulgar and likely manner was the trial of her strength to come
but when she was at the height of her success and full in the eye of the world and knew that everybody was remarking her and that from the sauces for which the doctor's table was once so famed but which even colonel chiley no longer thought of identifying as dr marjoribanks's to the fashion of the high white frock in which lucilla had taught the young ladies of carlingford to appear of an evening she was being imitated on every handat that moment when an ordinary person would have had her head turned and gone wild with too much success miss marjoribanks suddenly saw her dragon approaching her
just then when she could not put on a new ribbon or do her hair in a different style without all carlingford knowing of itat that epoch of intoxication and triumph the danger came sudden appalling and unlooked for
if lucilla was staggered by the encounter she never showed it but met the difficulty like a woman of mettle and scorned to flinch
it had come to be summer weather when the final day arrived upon which mr cavendish forgot himself altogether and went over to the insidious enemy whom miss marjoribanks had been nourishing in her bosom
fifty eyes were upon lucilla watching her conduct at that critical momentfifty ears were on the strain to divine her sentiments in her voice and to catch some intonation at least which should betray her consciousness of what was going on
but if miss marjoribanks's biographer has fitly discharged his duty the readers of this history will have no difficulty in divining that the curiosity of the spectators got no satisfaction from lucilla
many people even supposed she had not remarked anything her composure was so perfect
no growing red or growing pale no harsh notes in her voice nor evidence of distracted attention betrayed that her mind was elsewhere while she was attending to her guests and yet to be sure she saw just as other people did that barbara all flushed and crimson with her eyes blazing under their sullen brows stood in a glow of triumph at the open window with mr cavendish in devoted attendancea captive at her chariotwheels
matters had been progressing to this point for some time but yet the two culprits had never before showed themselves so lost to all sense of propriety
instead of fainting or getting pale or showing any other symptoms of violent despite lucilla went upon her airy way indirectly approaching this point of interest
she went up and chatted with them and ordered mr cavendish to find a chair for barbara
what can you be thinking of to let her stand so near the window
if she were to catch cold and lose her voice what should we all do
said lucilla and she established the two in the most commodious corner before she left them
take care she does not go back again into the draught were her parting words and even the culprits themselves could do nothing but stare at each other with consternation and shame
this was all the notice lucilla took of what was going on
if she was affronted or if she was wounded nobody found it out and when mrs chiley offered the tribute of her indignation and sympathy it has already been recorded how her young friend responded to her
fortunately my affections never were engaged lucilla said and no doubt that was a great advantage but then as we have said there are other things besides affections to be taken into account when the woman whom you have been kind to snaps up the man who has been paying attention to you not only before your eyes but before the eyes of all the world
the result of her masterly conduct on this occasion was that her defeat became as we have said a triumph for miss marjoribanks
to be sure it is to be hoped that in the sweets of their mutual regard the two criminals found compensation for the disapproval of the spectators but nothing could be more marked than the way in which carlingford turned its cold shoulder on its early favourite
i never imagined cavendish was such a fool mr centum said who was a man of few words if he likes that style of philandering it is nothing to me but he need not make an idiot of himself
as for mr woodburn he as was natural inflicted vicarious punishment upon his wife
it must be all your fault he growled when he was taking her home and had her at his mercy with that logic peculiar to a married man you ought to tell him he's making an ass of himself
why the deuce do you let him go on with that tomfoolery
he'll lose all his chances in life and then i hope you'll be satisfied
you women can never see an inch before your own noses
cried the uncivil husband which it must be confessed was rather hard upon poor mrs woodburn who had nothing to do with it and had indeed calculated upon perfecting her sketch of barbara in the quietness of the walk home for as everybody lived in grange lane carriages were not necessary for miss marjoribanks's guests
they flitted out and in in the moonlight with pretty scarfs thrown over their heads and laced handkerchiefs tied under their chins and made grange lane between the two straight lines of gardenwall like a scene in a masquerade
while mr cavendish was thus suffering by deputy the contempt of his former admirers lucilla by herself in the abandoned drawingroom was thinking over the evening with a severe but on the whole satisfactory selfexamination
after the first shock which she had encountered with so much courage miss marjoribanks was rather grateful than otherwise to providence which had brought the necessary trial upon her in this form
if it had been a breakdown and humiliating failure instead how different would her sensations have been
and lucilla was quite conscious that such a thing might have occurred
it might have occurred to her as it had done to so many people to see thursday come round with a failure of all that made thursday agreeable
lady richmond might have had her influenza that day and little henry centum his sudden attack which had kept his mother in conversation ever since and mrs woodburn one of her bad headaches and as for the miss browns there was nothing in the world but lucilla's habitual good fortune which prevented them from having blacked their fingers with their photography to such an extent as to make them perfectly unpresentable
or to turn to another chapter of accidents the last duet which barbara had insisted upon singing without proper practice might have broken down utterly
none of these things had happened and lucilla drew a long breath of gratitude as she thought how fortunate she had been in all these particulars
to be sure it was necessary to have a trial of one kind or other and the modest but intense gratification of having stood the test diffused itself like a balm through her bosom
no doubt she would have felt like most people a certain pleasure in snubbing barbara but then there is on the other hand a sweetness in sacrificing such impulses to the sacred sense of duty and the high aims of genius which is still more attractive to a wellregulated mind
miss marjoribanks herself put out the candles and went to her own room with that feeling of having acquitted herself satisfactorily which many people think to be the highest gratification of which the mind is capable
after all it was by no means certain that mr cavendish would be mp
for carlingford
mr chiltern might live for twenty years or he even might get better which was more unlikely or supposing him to be comfortably disposed of nobody could say with any certainty that some man unknown at present in carlingford might not start up all of a sudden and gain the most sweet voices of the shopkeepers who were the majority of the community and quite outnumbered grange lane
it was thus that lucilla consoled herself as she went meditative but undaunted to her maiden rest
while all this was going on dr marjoribanks remained an amused spectator and chuckled a little quietly without saying anything to anybody over the turn affairs had taken
the doctor knew all about everybody in carlingford and he had never been an enthusiast in favour of mrs woodburn's brother notwithstanding that the young man had been received so warmly into society as one of the cavendishes
perhaps dr marjoribanks being scotch and having a turn for genealogy found the description a little vague but at all events there can be no doubt that he laughed to himself as he retired from the scene of his daughter's trial
the doctor possibly thought in a professional point of view that a little discipline of this description would be useful to lucilla
perhaps he thought it would be good for her to find out thatthough she had managed to slip the reins out of his hands and get the control of affairs with a skill which amused the doctor and made him a little proud of her abilities even though he was himself the victimshe could not go on always unchecked in her triumphant career but must endure like other people an occasional defeat
no doubt had lucilla been really worsted paternal feeling would have interposed and dr marjoribanks would to some extent have suffered in her suffering but then the case was different and nobody required as it turned out to suffer for lucilla
the doctor was pleased she had shown so much spirit and pleased to see how entirely she had discomfited her antagonists and turned the tables upon the young puppy in whom he had no confidence and withal dr marjoribanks chuckled a little in his secret heart over the event itself and concluded that it would do lucilla good
she had vanquished nancy and by a skilful jerk taken the reins out of his own experienced hands
he was aware that he had been on the whole very wisely governed since his abdication but yet he was not sorry that the young conqueror should feel herself human so that nobody except mrs chiley felt that mingled rage and disappointment with which barbara lake had hoped to inspire lucilla's bosom and mrs chiley so to speak had nothing to do with it
as for barbara herself she returned home in a state of mingled spite and exultation and disgust which filled her sister with amazement
she is such an actor you know barbara said she never will give in to let you know how she is feelingnot if she can help it but for all that she must have felt it
nobody could help feeling it though she carried it off so well
i knew how it would be as soon as i had on a dress that was fit to be seen
what is it that she could not help feeling
said rose
i suppose it is lucilla you mean
i should like to know what right she had to be kind to me cried barbara all glowing in her sullen but excited beauty and invite me there and introduce me in her grand way as if she was any better than i am
and then to look at all her india muslins but i knew it would be different as soon as i had a decent dress said the contralto rising up to contemplate herself in the little mirror over the mantelpiece
this conversation took place in mr lake's little parlour where rose had been waiting for her sister and where barbara's white dress made an unusual radiance in the dim and partiallylighted room
rose herself was all shrouded up in her morning dress with her pretty round arms and shoulders lost to the common view
she had been amusing herself as she waited by working at a corner of that great design which was to win the prize on a later occasion
readers of this history who have studied the earlier chapters will remember that rose's tastes in ornamentation were very clearly defined for so young a person
instead of losing herself in vague garlands of impossible flowers the young artist clung with the tenacity of first love to the thistle leaf which had been the foundation of her early triumphs
her mind was full of it even while she received and listened to barbara whether to treat it in a national point of view bringing in the rose and shamrock which was a perfectly allowable proceeding though perhaps not originalor whether she should yield to the sweet feeling which had been so conspicuous in her flounce in the opinion of the marlborough house gentlemenor whether on the contrary she should handle the subject in a boldly naturalistic way and use her spikes with freedomwas a question which occupied at that moment all rose's faculties
even while she asked barbara what the subject was on which lucilla might be supposed to be excited she was within herself thinking out this difficult ideaall the more difficult perhaps considering the nature of the subject since the design in this case was not for a flounce in which broad handling is practicable but for a veil
i wish you would not talk in that foolish way said rose nobody need be any better than you as you say
to be sure we don't live in grange lane nor keep a carriage but i wish you would recollect that these are only accidental circumstances
as for dress i don't see that you require it our position is so clearly defined we are a family of  oh for goodness gracious sake do be quiet with your family of artists
cried barbara
speak for yourself if you please
i am not an artist and never will be i can tell you
there are better places to live in than grange lane and as for keeping a carriage i would never call a little bit of a brougham a carriage if it was me
lucilla made believe to take no notice but she did not deceive me with that
she was as disappointed as ever she could bei dare say now she's sitting crying over it
i never would have cared one straw if i had not wanted to serve lucilla out
cried the contralto with energy
she was still standing before the glass pulling her black hair about into new combinations and studying the effect and as for rose she too looked up and seeing her sister's face reflected in the glass made the discovery that there was something like grimace in the countenance and paused in the midst of her meditations with her pencil in her hand
don't put yourself out of drawing said rose i wish you would not do that so often
when the facial angle is disturbed to that extentbut about lucilla i think you are excessively ungrateful
gratitude is not a servile sentiment said the little preraphaelite with a rising colour
it is a slavish sort of idea to think any one has done you an injury by being kind to you
if that is the sort of thing you are going to talk of i think you had better go to bed
then i will and i shan't tell you anything said barbara angrilyyou are so poorspirited
for my part do you think i'd ever have gone to help lucilla and sing for her and all that sort of thing if it had not been to better myself
nor i wouldn't have thought of him just at first if it hadn't been to spite her
and i've done it too
i'd just like to look in at her room window and see what she's about
i dare say she is crying her eyes out for all her looking as if she took no notice
i know better than to think she doesn't care
and rose he's such a dear said barbara with a laugh of excitement
to be sure what she wanted was to be mrs cavendish and to have a handsome house and a great many nice dresses but at the same time she was young and mr cavendish was goodlooking and she was a little in love in her way as well
i don't want to hear any more about it said rose who was so much moved as to forget even her design
i can't think how it is you have no sense of honour and you one of the lakes
i would not be a traitor for a dozen mr cavendishes
cried rose in the force of her indignation
he must be a cheat since you are a traitor
if he was a true man he would have found you out
you had better be quiet rose said barbara you may be sure i shall never do anything for you after we are married if you talk like that and then you'll be sorry enough
after you are married
has he asked you to marry him
cried rose
she pushed away her design with both her hands in the vehemence of her feelings and regarded her sister with eyes which blazed but which were totally different in their blazing from those which burned under barbara's level eyebrows
it was too plain a question to have a plain answer
barbara only lighted her candle in reply and smiled and shook her head
you don't suppose i am going to answer after your insulting ways she said taking up her candle and she swept out of the room in her white dress with a sense of pleasure in leaving this grand point unsettled
to be sure mr cavendish had not yet asked that important question but then the future was all before them and the way clear
as for rose she clenched her little fists with a gesture that would have been too forcible for any one who was not an artist and a member of a family of artists
to think she should be one of us and not to know what honour means said rose and as for this man he must be a cheat himself or he would find her out
this was how mr cavendish's defection from lucilla took place and at the same time it is a satisfaction to know that the event was received by everybody very much as little rose lake received it
and as for miss marjoribanks if barbara could have had the malicious satisfaction of looking in at the window she would have been mortified to find that rightminded young woman sleeping the sleep of the just and innocent and enjoying repose as profound and agreeable as if there had been no mr cavendish in the world not to speak of carlingfordwhich to be sure was a result to be greatly attributed to lucilla's perfect health and entire satisfaction with herself
chapter xv   this event was of far too much importance in the limited world of grange lane to pass over without some of the many commentaries which were going on upon the subject coming to the ears of miss marjoribanks who was the person principally concerned
as for the doctor as we have already said he was so far lost to a sense of his paternal duties as to chuckle a little within himself over the accident that had happened to lucilla
it had done her no harm and dr marjoribanks permitted himself to regard the occurrence in a professional point of view as supplying a little alterative which he could scarcely administer himself for it is well known that physicians are seldom successful in the treatment of their own families
he was more jocose than usual at breakfast for some days following and on the morning of the next thursday asked if everybody was to come as usual with a significance which did not escape the young mistress of the house
you know best papa she said cheerfully as she poured him out his coffee if there is anybody who is ill and can't come it must be your faultbut i did not hear that any one was ill  nor i said the doctor with a quiet laugh and he could not help thinking it would be good sport to see cavendish come into the drawingroom all by himself without any support and make his appearance before miss marjoribanks and do his best to be agreeable with an awful consciousness of his bad behaviour and nobody sufficiently benevolent to help him out
the doctor thought it would serve him right but yet he was not sufficiently irritated nor sufficiently sympathetic to lose any of the humour of the situation and it was with a little zest as for something especially piquant that he looked forward to the evening
as for miss marjoribanks she too recognised the importance of the occasion
she resolved to produce that evening a new plat which had occupied a corner of her busy mind for some time past
it was a crisis which called for a new step in advance
she sat down by the window after breakfast with various novel combinations floating in her creative brain and while she was revolving these ideas in her mind nancy came in with more than her usual briskness
it is true that lucilla had her household well in hand and possessed the faculty of government to a remarkable extent but still under the best of circumstances it was a serious business to propose a new dish to nancy
dr marjoribanks's factotum was a woman of genius in her way and by no means unenlightened or an enemy of progress but then she had a weakness common to many persons of superior intelligence and decided character
when there was anything new to be introduced nancy liked to be herself the godmother of the interesting novelty for to be sure it was her place and miss lucilla though she was very clever was not to be expected to understand what came in best with the other dishes for a dinner
i ain't one as goes just upon fish and flesh and fowl like some as call themselves cooks nancy said
if i have a failing it's for things as suits
when it's brown make it brown and don't be mean about the gravybeefthat's my principle and when it ain't brown mind what you're adoing ofand don't go and throw a heap of entrys and things at a gentleman's head without no 'armony
i always says to miss lucilla as 'armony's the thing and when i've set it all straight in my mind i ain't one as likes to be put out nancy would add with a gleam in her eye which betokened mischief
miss marjoribanks was much too sensible not to be aware of this peculiarity and accordingly she cleared her throat with something as near nervousness as was possible to lucilla before she opened her lips to propose the innovation
miss marjoribanks as a general rule did not show much nervousness in her dealings with her prime minister any more than in her demeanour towards the less important members of society and consequently nancy remarked the momentary timidity and a flash of sympathy and indignation took the place of her usual impulse of defiance
i heard as master said there was some gentleman as wasn't acoming said nancy
not as one makes no difference in a dinner but i allays likes to know
i don't like no waste for my part
i ain't one as calk'lates too close but if there's one thing as i hates like poison it's waste
i said as i would ask for thomas ain't as correct as could be wished
is it one less than usual miss lucilla
said nancy and it was lucilla's fault if she did not understand the profound and indignant sympathy in nancy's voice
oh no it is just the usual number said miss marjoribanks
it was only a joke of papa'sthey are all just as usual and here lucilla paused
she was thinking of the dish she wanted but nancy thought she was thinking of mr cavendish who had treated her so badly
she studied the countenance of her young mistress with the interest of a woman who has had her experiences and knows how little they are to be depended upon
nancy murmured poor dear
under her breath almost without knowing it and then a brilliant inspiration came to her mind
few people have the gift of interfering successfully in such cases but then to offer consolation is a christian duty especially when one has the confidence that to give consolation is in one's power
miss lucilla i would say as you've been doing too much if anybody was to ask me said nancy moved by this generous impulseall them practisings and things
they're well enough for young ladies as ain't got nothing else to do but you as has such a deal in your handsif there was any little thing as you could fancy for dinner said nancy in her most bland accents i've set it all down as i thought would be nicest allays if you approves miss lucilla but if there was any little thing as you could fancy poor dear it's all as we can do she murmured to herself
the faithless could not be brought back again but ariadne might at least have any little thing she could fancy for dinner which indeed is a very general treatment of such a case on the part of perplexed sympathisers who do not know what to say
lucilla was so excited for the moment by this unusual evidence of her own good fortune that she had almost spoiled all by sitting straight up and entering with her usual energy into the discussionbut instinct saved miss marjoribanks from this mistake
she lost no time in taking advantage of the opportunity and instead of having a fight with nancy and getting a reluctant consent and still more reluctant execution of the novelty lucilla felt that she was doing that excellent woman a favour by naming her new dish
nancy approved so thoroughly as to be enthusiastic
i always said as she had a deal of sense she said afterwards triumphantly
there ain't one young lady in a hundred as knows what's good for her like miss lucilla
but notwithstanding this fervent declaration of approval nancy softened as she was could not but linger when all was concluded to give a little advice
i wouldn't worrit myself with all them practisings miss lucilla if i was you said her faithful retainer
they're a deal too much for you
i've took the liberty when all was cleaned up to go on the stair and listen a bit and there ain't nothing to equal it when you're asinging by yourself
i don't think nothing of them duetsand as for that boldfaced brazen thing  oh nancy hush
said lucilla miss lake has a beautiful voice
if she does not look quite like a lady it is not her fault poor thing
she has no mamma to set her right you know
she is the best assistant i haveshe and mr cavendish said lucilla sweetly and she gave nancy a look which moved the faithful servant almost to tears though she was not addicted to that weakness
nancy retired with the most enthusiastic determination to exert herself to the utmost for the preparation of the little dish which lucilla fancied
but i wouldn't worrit about them duets she said again as she left the room
i wouldn't not if i was you miss lucilla asking pardon for the liberty as for having no mamma you have no mamma yourself and you the young lady as is most thought upon in carlingford and as different from that brazenfaced thing with her red cheeks  hush oh hush nancy lucilla said as she sank back in her chair but miss marjoribanks after all was only human and she was not so distressed by these unpolished epithets as she might or perhaps ought to have been
poor barbara
i wish she could only look a little bit like a lady she said to herself and so proceeded with her preparations for the evening
she had all her plans matured and she felt quite comfortable about that evening which all her friends were thinking would be rather trying for lucilla
to tell the truth when a thing became rather trying lucilla's spirits rose
mr cavendish's desertion was perhaps on the whole more than compensated for by the exhilaration of a difficulty to be encountered
she too began to forecast like her father the possibilities of the evening and to think of mr cavendish coming in to dinner when there was nobody to support him and not even a crowd of people to retire among
would he run the risk of coming under the circumstances
or if he came would he prostrate himself as he had done on a previous occasion and return to his allegiance
this question roused lucilla to a degree of energy unusual even to her who was always energetic
it was then that the brilliant idea struck her of adjourning to the garden in the eveninga practice which was received with such enthusiasm in carlingford where the gardens were so pretty
she put on her hat directly and went downstairs and called the gardener to consult him about it and it was thus that she was employed when mrs chiley rang the bell at the garden gate
if it had been anybody else in carlingford lucilla would have led her back again to the house and said nothing about the subject of her conference with the gardener for it is always best as all judicious persons are aware not to forestall these little arrangements which make so agreeable a surprise at the moment but then mrs chiley was miss marjoribanks's special confidant
the old lady had her face full of business that bright morning
she listened to what her young friend proposed but without hearing it and said
oh yes my dear i am sure it will be charming without the very least notion what it was she applauded
let us go in and sit down a moment for i have something to say to you lucilla mrs chiley said and when they had reached the drawingroom and shut the door the colonel's wife gave her favourite a kiss and looked anxiously in her face
you have not been to see me since monday said mrs chiley
i am sure you are not well or you could not have stayed away so long but if you did not feel equal to going out why did you not send for me lucilla my poor dear
though miss marjoribanks's thoughts at that moment were full of the garden and not in the least occupied with those more troublesome matters which procured for her mrs chiley's sympathy she placed the kind old lady in the most easy chair and sat down by her as mrs chiley liked to see a young creature do
lucilla's affairs were too important to be trusted to a young confidante of her own age but even a person of acknowledged genius like miss marjoribanks is the better of some one to whom she can open up her breast
dear mrs chiley
said lucilla i am quite well and i meant to have come to see you today
my poor dear
said mrs chiley again
you say you are quite well for you have such a spirit but i can see what you have been going through
i don't understand how you can keep on and do so much
but it was not that that brought me here
there is some one coming to carlingford that i want you to meet lucilla
he is a relation of mary chiley's husband and as she does not get on very well with them you know i think it is our duty to be civil
and they say he is a very nice man and youngenough said mrs chiley with a look of some anxiety pausing to see the effect produced upon lucilla by her words
miss marjoribanks had not as she once confessed a very vivid sense of humour but she laughed a little in spite of herself at the old lady's anxious look
don't be sorry for me she said i told you that fortunately my affections were not engaged
i don't want any new gentleman introduced to me
if that was what i was thinking of i never need have come home lucilla said with a little dignity and yet to be sure she was naturally curious to know who the new man who was very nice and youngenough could be for such apparitions were not too plentiful in carlingford and it did not seem in reason that an individual of this interesting description could come out of colonel chiley's house
my dear he is a clergyman said mrs chiley putting her hand on miss marjoribanks's arm and speaking in a half whisper and you know a nice clergyman is always nice and you need not think of him as a young man unless you like
he has a nice property and he is rector of basing which is a very good living and archdeacon of stanmore
he has come here to hold a visitation you know and they say that if carlingford was made into a bishopric he is almost sure to be the first bishop and you know a bishop or even an archdeacon has a very nice position
i want to be civil to him for mary chiley's sake who is not on such terms as we could wish with her husband's friends and then i suppose he will have to be a great deal in carlingford and i should like him to form a good impression
i want you and your dear good papa to come and meet him and then after thatbut one thing is enough at a time the old lady said breaking off with a nod and a smile
she too had brought her bit of consolation to lucilla and it was a kind of consolation which when administered at the right moment is sometimes of sovereign efficacy as mrs chiley was aware
i am sure papa will be very happy said lucilla and indeed if you like i shall be very glad to ask him here
if he is a friend of yours that is quite enough for me
it is very nice to know a nice clergyman but as for being a young man i can't see how that matters
if i had been thinking of that i need neverbut i should think papa would like to meet him and you know it is the object of my life to please papa
yes my poor dear said the colonel's wife and he would be hardhearted indeed if he was not pleased but still we must consider you a little lucilla
you do everything for other people and you never think of yourself
but i like to see you with nice people round you for my part mrs chiley addedreally nice people and not these poorspirited ungrateful  hush hush
said lucilla i don't know such nice people anywhere as there are in carlingford
some people are never pleased with their neighbours but i always get on so well with everybody
it is my good luck you know and so long as i have you dear mrs chiley  ah lucilla
said the old lady that is very kind of youand you could not have anybody that is fonder of you than i am but still i am an old woman old enough to be your grandmother my dearand we have your future interests to think of
as for all the vexations you have had i think i could find it in my heart to turn that ungrateful creature to the door
don't let her come here any more
i like your voice a great deal better when you are singing by yourselfand i am sure the archdeacon would be of my opinion said mrs chiley with a confidence which was beautiful to behold
it was true she had not seen her new hero as yet but that only left her so much more free to take the good of him and his probable sentiments for to persons of frank and simple imagination a very little foundation of fact is enough to build upon
dear mrs chiley it is so nice of you to be vexed said lucilla who thought it as well not to enter into any further argument
papa will be delighted i am sure and i can come in the evening
the colonel likes to have only six people and you will be three to start with so there can't be any room for me at dinner and you know i don't mind about dinner
i shall come in the evening and make tea for youand if you think he would like to come next thursday said lucilla graciously
this was how it was eventually settled
mrs chiley went home again through grange lane in the sunshine with that little oldwomanish hobble which mrs woodburn executed with such precision perfectly satisfied with her success and indulging herself in some pleasant visions
to be sure a nice clergyman is always nice to know even though nothing more was to come of it and a new man in the field of such distinguished pretensions would be lucilla's best defence against any sort of mortification
as for miss marjoribanks herself she was thinking a great deal more of the new details for the approaching evening than of anything else more distant and consequently less important but on the whole she was by no means displeased to hear of the archdeacon
in such a work as hers a skilful leader is always on the outlook for auxiliaries and there are circumstances in which a nice clergyman is almost as useful to the lady of the house as a man who can flirt
to be sure now and then there occurs a rare example in which both these qualities are united in one person but even in the most modest point of view if he was not stupid or obstinately lowchurch there was nothing to despise in the apparition of the archdeacon thus suddenly blown to her very door
while she had the seats placed in the garden not too visibly but shrouded among the shrubs and round the trunks of the trees and chose the spot for a little illumination which was not to be universal like a teagarden but concentrated in one spot under the big limetree lucilla permitted herself to speculate a little about this unknown hero
she did not so much ask herself if he would be dark or fair according to the usage of young ladies as whether he would be high or broad
but however that question like various others was still hidden in the surrounding darkness
this was how mrs chiley did her best to cheer up lucilla in the discouragement from which she supposed her young friend to be suffering
it was perhaps a loftier expedient in one way than nancy's desire that she should have something she would fancy for dinner but then there could not be any doubt as to the kindness which prompted both suggestions and after all it is not what people do for you but the spirit in which they do it which should be taken into consideration as lucilla most justly observed
chapter xvi   that evening was one which all the people in grange lane had unanimously concluded would be rather hard upon miss marjoribanks
to be sure when a crisis arrives there is always a certain excitement which keeps one up but afterwards when the excitement is over then is the time when it becomes really trying
there was naturally under these circumstances a larger assemblage than usual to watch the progress of the little drama and how lucilla would behave for after all society would be excessively tame if it were not for these personal complications which are always arising and which are so much better than a play
as for the doctor himself the portion of the evening's entertainment which particularly amused him was that which preceded all the restthe reception given by lucilla to her guests at dinner and especially to the culprit who came in quite alone and found nobody to stand up for him
mr cavendish who felt to the full the difficulty of his position and to tell the truth was a little ashamed of himself came late in order to abridge his trial as much as possible but lucilla's habitual goodfortune was not confined only to her own necessities but seemed to involve everybody opposed to her in a ceaseless illluck which was very edifying to the spectators
mr cavendish was so late that the other guests had formed into groups round the room leaving a great open space and avenue of approach to the lady of the house in the middle and the audience thus arranged was very impatient and unfavourable to the lingerer who kept them waiting for their dinner
when he came in at last instead of doing anything to help him everybody ceased talking and looked on in stern silence as the wretched culprit walked all the length of the room up to lucilla through the unoccupied space which exposed him so unmercifully on every side
they all stopped in the middle of what they were saying and fixed stony eyes on him as the dead sailors did on the ancient mariner
he had a very good spirit but still there are circumstances which take the courage out of a man
to be sure miss marjoribanks when he reached her at last received mr cavendish with the utmost grace and cordiality but it is easy to imagine what must have been the feelings of the unfortunate hero
the balaclava charge itself in the face of all the guns could have been nothing to the sensation of walking through that horrible naked space through a crowd of reproachful men who were waiting for dinner and it was only after it was all over and mr cavendish had safely arrived at miss marjoribanks's side and was being set at his ease poor wretch by her incomparable sweetness that the doctor with a certain grim smile on his countenance came and shook hands with his unfortunate guest
you are late dr marjoribanks said taking out the great watch by which all the pulses of grange lane considered it their duty to keep time and which marked five minutes after seven as everybody could see
it was ten minutes after seven by the pretty french clock on the mantelpiece and at least twenty by the lowering countenances of dr marjoribanks's guests
mr cavendish made the best of his unhappy position and threw himself upon lucilla's charity who was the only one who had any compassion upon him for to see mrs chiley's forbidding countenance no one could have believed that she had ever called him my dear
dinner is on the table papa miss marjoribanks said with a little reassuring nod to the culprit who had made her his refuge and she got up and shook out her white draperies with a charitable commotion for which her faithless admirer blessed her in his heart
but the place at her left hand was not left vacant for mr cavendish he had not the spirit to claim it even had he had the time and the consequence was that he found himself next to his brotherinlaw at table which was indeed a hard fate
as for lucilla she was quite radiant when the famous dish made its appearance which nancy had elaborated to please her and told the story of its introduction to her two next neighbours in a half whisper to their immense amusement
when the servants are gone i will tell you what we are laughing at she breathed across the table to mrs chiley who was more than delighted as she said to see her dear lucilla keeping up so well and when the dessert was put upon the table and thomas had finally disappeared miss marjoribanks kept her promise
i could not think how i was going to get her to consent lucilla said but you know she thought i was in low spirits the dear old soul and that it would be a comfort to me
though there was often a great deal of fun at dr marjoribanks's table nothing was ever heard there to compare with the laughter that greeted lucilla's narrative
everybody was so entirely aware of the supposed cause of the low spirits and indeed was so conscious of having speculated like nancy upon miss marjoribanks's probable demeanour at this trying moment that the laughter was not mere laughter but conveyed at the same time a confession of guilt and a storm of applause and admiration
as for mr cavendish it was alarming to look at him in the terrible paroxysm of confusion and shame which he tried to shield under the universal amusement
miss marjoribanks left the diningroom that evening with the soothing conviction that she had administered punishment of the most annihilating kind without for a moment diverging from the perfect sweetness and amiability with which it was her duty to treat all her father's guests
it was so complete and perfect that there was not another word to be said either on one side or the other and yet lucilla had not in the least committed herself or condescended from her maiden dignity
as for dr marjoribanks if he had chuckled over it before in anticipation it may be supposed how he enjoyed now this perfect vindication of his daughter's capacity for taking care of herself
the sound of the victory was even heard upstairs where the young ladies at the open windows were asking each other with a little envy what the men could be laughing at
there was as we have said a larger assembly than usual that night
for one thing it was moonlight and all the people from the country were there and then public curiosity was profoundly concerned as to how lucilla was to conduct herself on so trying an occasion
the laughter even jarred on the sensitive feelings of some people who thought where a young girl's happiness was concerned that it was too serious a matter to be laughed at but then miss marjoribanks was not a person who could be classed with ordinary young girls in the general acceptation of the word
it was when things were at this crisis and all eyes were directed to lucilla and a certain expectation was diffused through the company that miss marjoribanks made that proposal of adjourning to the garden which was received with so much applause
lucilla's instinct or rather her genius had warned her that something out of the ordinary course of proceedings would be expected from her on that special occasion
she could not get up and make a speech to her excited and curious audience neither could she apropos of nothing tell over again the story which had been received with such applause downstairs and yet something was wanting
the ordinary routine did not satisfy lucilla's constituency who had come with the laudable intention of observing her on a trying occasion and watching how she got through it
the air is so delicious tonight that i had some seats placed in the garden miss marjoribanks said and if you all like we will sing to you up here and give you as much music as ever you please
you know i never would consent to be too musical when everybody was in one room
it does not matter so much when there are a suite but then papa you know is only a professional man and i have but one drawingroom said lucilla with sweet humility
it was lady richmond to whom she was addressing herself at the moment who was a lady who liked to be the great lady of the party
it is only in summer that we can be a little like you fine people who have as many rooms as you please
when you are at a little distance we will sing to you all the evening if you like
but my dear are you sure you feel able for so much exertion
said lady richmond who was one of those people who did not think a young girl's happiness a thing to be trifled with and she looked with what she described afterwards as a very searching expression in miss marjoribanks's face
dear lady richmond i hope i am always able for my duty said that gentle martyr
papa would be wretched if he did not think we were all enjoying ourselves and you know it is the object of my life to be a comfort to papa
this was what the searching expression in lady richmond's eyes elicited from lucilla
the sentiment was perhaps a little different from that which she had conveyed to her delighted auditors in the diningroom but at the same time it was equally true for everybody in carlingford was aware of the grand object of miss marjoribanks's existence
lady richmond went down to the garden at the head of a bevy of ladies and seated herself under the drawingroom windows and placed a chair beside her own for mrs chiley
i am afraid that dear girl is keeping up too well lady richmond said i never saw such fortitude
all the young people say she does not feel it but as soon as i fixed my eyes on her i saw the difference
you can always find out what a girl's feelings are when you look into her eyes
yes said mrs chiley with a little doubt for she had been shaken in her convictions by the universal laughter though she was a little mystified herself by lucilla's anecdote and then she had never been gifted with eyes like lady richmond's which looked people through and through
she goes through a great deal and it never seems to do her any harm the old lady said with a little hesitation
it is such a comfort that she has a good constitution especially as her mother was so delicate and then lucilla has such a spirit  but one may try a good constitution too far said lady richmond and i am certain she is full of feeling
it is sure to come out when she sings and that is why i came to this seat
i should not like to lose a note
and do tell me who is that horrid flirting disagreeable girl added the county lady drawing her chair a little closer
by this time the garden was full of pretty figures and pleasant voices and under the limetree there was a glimmer of yellow light from the lamps and on the other side the moon was coming up steady like a ball of silver over the dark outlines of carlingford and even the two voices which swelled forth upstairs in the fullest accord betraying nothing of the personal sentiments of their owners were not more agreeable to hear than the rustle and murmur of sound which rose all over dr marjoribanks's smooth lawn and pretty shrubbery
here and there a group of the older people sat like lady richmond and mrs chiley listening with all their might and all about them were clusters of girls and their natural attendants arrested in their progress and standing still breathless just for this bar as young people pause in their walks and talks to listen to a chance nightingale
and to be sure whenever anybody was tired of the music there were quantities of corners to retire into not to speak of that bright spot full of yellow light under the limetree
nobody but lucilla ever could have thought of anything so delicious was what everybody said
and then the two singers upstairs gave so much scope to curiosity
do you think they are all by themselves
lydia brown was heard to ask with a little natural anxiety and the livelier imaginations among the party set to work at once to invent impossible tortures which the soprano might inflict on the contralto
but to tell the truth the two singers were by no means alone
half the gentlemen of the dinnerparty who were past the sentimental age and did not care about moonlight had gone upstairs according to their use and wont and remained there finding to their great satisfaction room to move about and comfortable chairs to sit down in
they sat and chatted in the corners in great content and goodhumour while lucilla and barbara executed the most charming duets
now and then old colonel chiley paused to put his two hands softly together and cry brava
but on the whole the gentlemen were not much disturbed by the music
and then there were a few ladies who were subject to neuralgia or apt to take bad colds in the head who preferred being upstairs
so that if lucilla had meant to pinch or maltreat her rival circumstances would have made it impossible
miss marjoribanks did nothing to barbara except incite her to sing her very best but no doubt she was the means of inflicting considerable pain on mr cavendish who stood at a little distance and looked and listened to both and perhaps had inward doubts as to the wisdom of his choice
such was the arrangement of the personages of the social drama and it was in this way that everybody was occupied when an event occurred which at a later period awoke much excitement in carlingford and had no small influence upon the future fate of some of the individuals whose history is here recorded
everything was as calm and cheerful and agreeable as if carlingford had been a social paradise and miss marjoribanks's drawingroom the seventh heaven of terrestrial harmony
the sky itself was not more peaceful nor gave less indication of any tempest than did the tranquil atmosphere below where all the people knew each other and everybody was friendly
lucilla had just risen from the piano and there was a little pause in which cheers were audible from the garden and colonel chiley in the midst of his conversation patted his two hands together and it was just at that moment that the drawingroom door opened and thomas came in followed by a gentleman
the gentleman was a stranger whom miss marjoribanks had never seen before and she made a step forward as was her duty as mistress of the house
but when she had made that one step lucilla suddenly stood still arrested by something more urgent than the arrival of a stranger
mr cavendish too had been standing with his face to the door and had seen the new arrival
he was directly in front of lucilla so near her that he could not move without attracting her attention
when miss marjoribanks took that step in advance mr cavendish as if by the same impulse suddenly and without saying a word turned right round like a man who had seen something terrible at which he dared not take a second look
he was too much absorbed at that moment in his own feelings to know that he was betraying himself to lucilla or even to be conscious that she was near him
his face was more than pale it had a green ghastly look as of a face from which all the blood had suddenly been withdrawn to reinforce the vital centre in some failing of nature
his underlip hung down and two hollows which had never been seen there before appeared in his cheeks
miss marjoribanks was so taken by surprise that she stood still thinking no more of her duties but regarding in utter dismay and amazement the look of dead stupefied terror which thus appeared so unexpectedly before her
mr cavendish had turned right round turning his back upon a lady to whom he had been talking the minute before
but he was as unconscious of doing so as of the fact that he had presented the spectacle of his miserable surprise and alarm in the most striking way to the one woman present who had a right to entertain a certain grudge against him
during this moment of unusual inaction on lucilla's part the stranger had been led up to colonel chiley and had shaken hands with him and was entering into some explanations which miss marjoribanks divined with her usual quick intelligence and then the old colonel roused himself up from his easychair and leaned over to speak to dr marjoribanks and showed symptoms of approaching the lady of the house
all these movements lucilla followed breathlessly with a strange consciousness that only her presence of mind stood between her faithless suitor and a real danger
and as if to prove the difference barbara lake chose that moment of all others to show her power and made an appeal to mr cavendish and his taste in music to which the unhappy man made no response
miss marjoribanks saw there was no time to lose
with a fearless hand she threw down a great portfolio of music which happened to be close to her just at his feet making a merciful disturbance
and then she turned and made her curtsey and received the homage of mr archdeacon beverley who had arrived a day before he was expected and had come to look after his host since his host had not been at home to receive him
but you have broken your musicstand or something lucilla said the colonel
oh no it is only a portfolio
i can't think what could make me so awkward said miss marjoribanks i suppose it was seeing some one come in whom i didn't know
and then the old gentleman as was his duty paid the archdeacon a compliment on having made such a commotion
we used to have the best of it in our day said the old soldier but now you churchmen are the men
miss marjoribanks heard the door open again before this little speech was finished
it was mr cavendish who was going out with a long step as if he with difficulty kept himself from running and he never came back again to say goodnight or made any further appearance either out of doors or indoors
it is true that the archdeacon made himself very agreeable but then one man never quite makes up for another
miss marjoribanks said nothing about it not even when mrs woodburn came up to her with a scared face and in full possession of her own identity which of itself was an extraordinary fact and proved that something had happened but it would be vain to say that lucilla was not much excited by this sudden gleam of mystery
it gave the archdeacon an extraordinary and altogether unexpected attraction and as for mr cavendish it was utterly inconceivable that a man in society whom everybody knew about should give way to such a panic
the question was what did it mean
chapter xvii   the arrival of mr archdeacon beverley in carlingford was for many reasons an event of importance to the town and especially to society which was concerned in anything that drew new and pleasant people to grange lane
for one thing it occurred at the time when that first proposal of elevating carlingford into a bishopric in order to relieve the present bishop of the district of a part of his immense diocese had just been mooted and supposing this conception to be ever carried out nobody could have been more eligible as first bishop than the archdeacon who was in the prime of life and a very successful clergyman
and then not to speak of anything so important his presence was a great attraction to the country clergy especially as he had come to hold a visitation
notwithstanding all this it is impossible to deny that mrs chiley his hostess and even miss marjoribanks herself regarded the manner of his first appearance with a certain displeasure
if he had only had the good sense to stay at home and not come to seek his entertainers
to be sure it is awkward to arrive at a house and find that everybody is out but still as mrs chiley justly observed the archdeacon was not a baby and he might have known better
coming to you the very first night and almost in his travelling things to take the cream off everything the old lady said with tears of vexation in her eyes and after that what have we to show him in carlingford lucilla
as for miss marjoribanks she was annoyed but she knew the wealth of her own resources and she was not in despair like her old friend
they never know any better she said sympathetically
dear mrs chiley there was nothing else to be expected but at the same time i don't think things are so very bad said lucilla for she had naturally a confidence in herself of which even mrs chiley's admiring faith fell short
the archdeacon himself took it quite cheerfully as if it was the most natural thing in the world
i have no doubt it was a very pleasant party if one could have got the keynote he said in his broadchurch way as if there was nothing more to be said on the subject and lucilla's thursday was the merest ordinary assembly
for there could be no doubt that he was broadchurch even though his antecedents had not proclaimed the fact
he had a way of talking on many subjects which alarmed his hostess
it was not that there was anything objectionable in what he saidfor to be sure a clergyman and an archdeacon may say a great many things that ordinary people would not like to venture onbut still it was impossible to tell what it might lead to for it is not everybody who knows when to stop as mr beverley in his position might be expected to do
it was the custom of good society in carlingford to give a respectful assent for example to mr bury's extreme lowchurchismas if it were profane as it certainly was not respectable to differ from the rectorand to give him as wide a field as possible for his missionary operations by keeping out of the way
but mr beverley had not the least regard for respectability nor that respect for religion which consists in keeping as clear of it as possible and the way in which he spoke of mr bury's views wounded some people's feelings
altogether he was as mrs chiley said an anxious person to have in the house for he just as often agreed with the gentlemen in their loose ways of thinking as with the more correct opinions by which the wives and mothers who had charge of their morality strove hard to keep them in the right way and that was the reverse of what one naturally expected from a clergyman
he was very nice and had a nice position and under all the circumstances it was not only a duty to pay attention to him but a duty from which results of a most agreeable character might spring but still though she could not be otherwise than kind it would be impossible to say that it was out of personal predilection that mrs chiley devoted herself to her guest
she admitted frankly that he was not like what clergymen were in her time
for one thing he seemed to think that every silly boy and girl ought to have an opinion and be consulted as if they had anything to do with itwhich was just the way to turn their heads and make them utterly insupportable
on the whole perhaps the old lady was more charitable to mary chiley and understood better how it was that she brought up in sound church principles did not get on so well as might be desired with her husband's family after a week of the archdeacon
and yet he was a delightful person and full of information as everybody admitted and if carlingford should be erected into a bishopric as would be only rightand if mr beverley should happen to be appointed bishop as was highly probablethen it would be a pleasure to think that one had been kind to him
at the same time it must be owned that he showed a great want of tact in coming to miss marjoribanks's thursday on the night of his arrival and thus brushing as it were the very cream off his introduction to grange lane
and mrs chiley still sighed a little over mr cavendish and thought within herself that it was not his fault but that designing artful creature who was enough to lead any man wrong
for it was very clear to the meanest capacity that nobody could ever call the archdeacon my dear as with all his faults it had been possible to call mr cavendish
and by this line of thought mrs chiley was led to regret mr cavendish and to wonder what had become of him and what family affairs it could be that had taken him so suddenly away
a great many people in carlingford were at that moment occupied by the same wonders and regrets
some people thought he was frightened to find how far he had gone with that miss lake and had left town for a little to be out of the way and some thought he must have been speculating and have lost money
to tell the truth it was very strange that he should have disappeared so suddenlyjust at the moment too when old mr chiltern had one of his bad attacks of bronchitis which dr marjoribanks himself had admitted might carry him off any day
nothing could be more important to the future interests of young cavendish than to be on the spot at this critical moment and yet he had disappeared without telling anybody he was going or where he was going which was on the whole a perfectly unexplainable proceeding
his very servants as had been ascertained by some inquiring mind in the community were unaware of his intention up to the very last moment and certainly he had not said goodbye to anybody before leaving dr marjoribanks's garden on that thursday evening
mr woodburn who was not a person of very refined perceptions was the only man who found his disappearance quite natural
after making such a deuced ass of himself by george
what could the fellow do
said his brotherinlaw who naturally enjoyed the discomfiture of so near a connection and this was no doubt a providential circumstance for mrs woodburn who was thus saved from the necessity of explaining or accounting for her brother's unexpected disappearance but it failed to satisfy the general community who did not think mr cavendish likely to give in at the first blow even of so distinguished an antagonist as miss marjoribanks
some of the more charitable inhabitants of grange lane concluded that it must be the sudden illness of some relative which had called him away but then though he was well known to be one of the cavendishes neither he nor his sister ever spoke much of their connections and on the whole public opinion fluctuated between the two first suggestionswhich seemed truest to nature at least whether or not they might be fully corroborated by factwhich were either that mr cavendish had taken fright as he might very naturally have done at the advanced state of his relations with barbara lake or that he had speculated and lost money
in either case his departure would have been natural enough and need not perhaps have been accomplished with quite so much precipitation but still such a community as that in grange lane was in circumstances to comprehend how a young man might take fright and leave home either because of losing a lot of money or getting entangled with a drawingmaster's daughter
the immediate result so far as society was concerned was one for which people did not know whether to be most glad or sorry
mrs woodburn who kept half the people in grange lane in terror of their lives seemed to have lost all her inspiration now her brother was away
she did not seem to have the heart to take off anybody which was quite a serious matter for the amusement of the community
to be sure some people were thankful as supposing themselves exempted from caricature but then unfortunately as has been said the people who were most afraid for mrs woodburn were precisely those who were unworthy of her trouble and had nothing about them to give occupation to her graphic powers
as for miss marjoribanks who had supplied one of the mimic's most effective studies she was much disturbed by the failure of this element of entertainment
i have always thought it very strange that i never had any sense of humour lucilla said but it would not do you know if all the world was like me and society would be nothing if everybody did not exert themselves to the best of their abilities
there was a mournful intonation in lucilla's voice as she said this for to tell the truth since mr cavendish's departure she had been dreadfully sensible of the utter absence of any man who could flirt
as for osmond brown and the other boys of his age it might be possible to train them but at the best they were only a provision for the future and in the meantime miss marjoribanks could not but be sensible of her loss
she lamented it with such sincerity that all the world thought her the most perfect actress in existence
i have nothing to say against any of you lucilla would say contemplating with the eye of an artist the young men of grange lane who were her raw material
i dare say you will all fall in love with somebody sooner or later and be very happy and good for nothing but you are no assistance in any way to society
it is mr cavendish i am sighing for said the woman of genius with the candour of a great mind and even mrs woodburn was beguiled out of her despondency by a study so unparalleled
all this time however lucilla had not forgotten the last look of her faithless admirer as he faced round upon her when mr archdeacon beverley came into the room
she too like everybody else wondered innocently why mr cavendish had gone away and when he was coming back again but she never hinted to any one that the archdeacon had anything to do with it for indeed as she said to herself she had no positive evidence except that of a look that the archdeacon had anything to do with it
by which it will be seen that miss marjoribanks's prudence equalled her other great qualities
it would be wrong to say however that her curiosity was not excited and that in a very lively way for the vague wonder of the public mind over a strange fact could never be compared in intensity to the surprise and curiosity excited by something one has actually seen and which gives one as it were a share in the secretif indeed there was a secret which was a matter upon which lucilla within herself had quite made up her mind
as for the archdeacon the place which he took in society was one quite different from that which had been filled by mr cavendish as indeed was natural
he was one of those men who are very strong for the masculine side of christianity and when he was with the ladies he had a sense that he ought to be paid attention to instead of taking that trouble in his own person
miss marjoribanks was not a woman to be blind to the advantages of this situation but still as was to be expected it took her a little time to get used to it and to make all the use of it which was practicable under the circumstanceswhich was all the more difficult since she was not in the least viewy in her own person but had been brought up in the oldfashioned orthodox way of having a great respect for religion and as little to do with it as possible which was a state of mind largely prevalent in carlingford
but that was not in the least mr beverley's way
it was when lucilla's mind was much occupied by this problem that she received a visit quite unexpectedly one morning from little rose lake who had just at that time a great deal on her mind
for it may easily be supposed that mr cavendish's sudden departure which bewildered the general public who had no special interest in the matter must have had a still more overwhelming effect upon barbara lake who had just been raised to the very highest pinnacle of hope closely touching upon reality when all her expectations collapsed and came to nothing in a moment
she would not believe at first that it could be true and then when it was no longer possible to resist the absolute certainty of mr cavendish's departure her disappointment found vent in every kind of violencehysterics and other manifestations of unreason and selfwill
rose had been obliged to leave the female school of design upon her papa's overburdened shoulders and stay at home to nurse her sister
perhaps the little artist was not the best person to take care of a sufferer under such circumstances for she was neither unreasonable nor selfwilled to speak of though perhaps a little opinionative in her wayand could not be brought to think that a whole household should be disturbed and disordered and a young woman in good health retire to her room and lose all control of herself because a young man with whom she had no acquaintance three months before had gone out of town unexpectedly
perhaps it was a want of feeling on the part of the unsympathetic sister
she gave out that barbara was ill and kept up a most subdued and anxious countenance downstairs for the benefit of the children and the maidofallwork who represented public opinion in grove street but when rose went into her sister's room where barbara kept the blinds down and had her face swollen with crying it was with a very stern countenance that her little mentor regarded the invalid
i do not ask you to have a sense of duty rose said with a certain fine disdain but at least you might have a proper pride
this was all she took the trouble to say but it must be admitted that a great deal more to the same effect might be read in her eyes which were generally so dewy and soft but which could flash on occasion
and then as the week drew on towards thursday and all her representations proved unavailing to induce barbara to get up and prepare herself for her usual duties the scorn and vexation and impatience with which the dutiful little soul met her sister's sullen determination that she was not able to fulfil her ordinary engagements roused rose up to a great resolution
for her own part she was one of the people who do not understand giving in
what do you mean by lying there
she said pounding barbara down small and cutting her to pieces with infallible good sense and logic will that do any good
you would try to look better than usual and sing better than usual if you had any proper pride
i did not fall ill when my flounce was passed over at the exhibition
i made up my mind that very evening about the combination for my veil
i would die rather than give in if i were you
your flounce
sobbed barbaraoh you unfeeling insensible thingas if your hheart had anything to do withthat
i only went to sspite lucillaand i won't gono moreoh no morenow he's been and deserted me
you can't understand my feelingsggo away and leave me alone
barbara said rose with solemnity i would forgive you if you would not be mean
i don't understand it in one of us
if mr cavendish has gone away it shows that he does not care for you and you would scorn him and scorn to show you were thinking of him if you had any proper pride
but all the answer barbara gave was to turn away with a jerk of annoyance the old easychair in which she was lying buried with her hands thrust up into her black hair and her eyes all red upon which rose left her to carry out her own resolution
she was prompt in all her movements and she wasted no time on reconsideration
she went down into grange lane her little head erect and her bright eyes regarding the world with that air of frank recognition and acknowledgment which rose felt she owed as an artist to her fellowcreatures
they were all good subjects more or less and the consciousness that she could draw them and immortalise them gave her the same sense of confidence in their friendliness and her own perfect command of the situation as a young princess might have felt whose rank protected her like an invisible buckler
rose too walked erect and openeyed in the confidence of her rank which made her everybody's equal
it was in this frame of mind that she arrived at dr marjoribanks's house and found lucilla who was very glad to see her
miss marjoribanks was pondering deeply on the archdeacon at that moment and her little visitor seemed as one sent by heaven to help her out
for to tell the truth though lucilla understood all about mr cavendish and men of his description and how to manage them and take full use of their powers even her commanding intelligence felt the lack of experience in respect to such a case as that of the archdeacon who required a different treatment to draw him out
she was thinking it over intently at the moment of rose's arrival for lucilla was not a person to give up the advantages of a novel position because she did not quite understand it
she felt within herself that there was no doubt a great effect might be produced if she could but see how to do it
and it was thursday morning and there was no time to lose
i came to speak to you about barbara said rose
she is not fit to come out this morning
i told her it was very ungrateful not to make an effort after you had been so kind but i am sorry to say she has not a strong sense of duty and i don't think she would be able to sing or do anything but look stupid
i hope you will not think very badly of her
there are some people who can't help giving in i suppose said rose with an impatient little sigh
and so this is you you dear little rose
said lucilla and i have never seen you before since i came homeand you always were such a pet of mine at mount pleasant
i can't think why you never came to see me before as for me you know i never have any time
poor papa has nobody else to take care of him and it always was the object of my life to be a comfort to papa
yes said rose who was a straightforward little woman and not given to compliments
i have a great deal to do too she said and then all my spare moments i am working at my design
papa always says that society accepts artists for what they can give and does not expect them to sacrifice their time rose continued with her little air of dignity
miss marjoribanks knew very well that society was utterly unconscious of the existence of the lake family but then there is always something imposing in such a perfectly innocent and superb assumption as that to which the young preraphaelite had just given utterance and it began to dawn upon lucilla that here was another imperfectly understood but effective instrument lying ready to her hand
i should like to see your design said miss marjoribanks graciously
you made such a pretty little wreath for the corner of my handkerchiefdon't you rememberall frogs' legs and things
it looked so sweet in the old satin stitch
what is the matter with poor barbara
i felt sure she would catch cold and lose her voice
i shall tell papa to go and see her
as for tonight it will be a dreadful loss to be sure for i never could find a voice that went so well with mine
but if you are sure she can't come  when people have not a sense of duty said rose with an indignant sigh nor any proper pridesome are so different
barbara ought to have been some rich person's daughter with nothing to do
she would not mind being of no use in the world
it is a kind of temperament i don't understand continued the little artist
all this it is true was novel to miss marjoribanks who had a kind of prejudice in favour of the daughters of rich persons who had nothing to do but lucilla's genius was broad and catholic and did not insist upon comprehending everything
she gave rose a sudden scrutinising look and measured her mentally against the gap she had to fill
no doubt it was an experiment and might fail signally but then miss marjoribanks was always at hand to cover deficiencies and she had that confidence in herself and her good fortune which is necessary to everybody who greatly dares
you must come yourself this evening you dear old rose said lucilla
you know i always was fond of you
oh yes i know you can't sing like barbara
but the archdeacon is coming who understands about art and if you would like to bring your designmy principle has always been that there should be a little of everything in society said miss marjoribanks
i dare say you will feel a little strange at first with not knowing the people but that will soon pass offand you must come
when she had said this lucilla bestowed upon little rose a friendly schoolfellow kiss putting her hands upon the little artist's shoulders and looking her full in the face as she did so
i am sure you can talk said miss marjoribanks
she did not say go away now and leave me to my arrangements but rose who was quickwitted understood that the salute was a dismissal and she went away accordingly tingling with pride and excitement and pleasure and a kind of pain
the idea of practically exemplifying in her own person the kind of demeanour which society ought to expect from an artist had not occurred to rose but destiny having arranged it so she was not the woman to withdraw from her responsibilities
she said to herself that it would be shabby for her who was known to have opinions on this subject to shrink from carrying them out and stimulated her courage by recourse to her principles as people do who feel themselves bound to lay sacrifices on the altar of duty
notwithstanding this elevated view of the emergency it must be admitted that a sudden thought of what she would wear had flushed to rose's very fingertips with a heat and tingle of which the little heroine was ashamed
for it was thursday morning and there was not a moment to be lost
however after the first thrill which this idea had given her rose bethought herself once more of her principles and stilled her beating heart
it was not for her to think of what she was to put on she who had so often proclaimed the exemption of a family of artists from the rules which weigh so hard upon the common world
we have a rank of our own she said to herself but with that tremor which always accompanies the transference of a purely theoretical and even fantastic rule of conduct into practical groundwe are everybody's equal and we are nobody's equaland when papa begins to be appreciated as he ought to be and willie has made a name this was always the point at which rose broke off falling into reverie that could not be expressed in words but she had no leisure to remark upon the chance compositions in the street or the effects of light and shade as she went home
a sudden and heavy responsibility had fallen upon her shoulders and she would have scorned herself had she deserted her post
chapter xviii   but the anticipations of rose lake were trifling matters in comparison with the universal interest and even excitement which attended the archdeacon's first appearance in carlingford
what might be called his first public appearance took place at dr marjoribanks's table although he had previously dined at the rectory and also at sir john richmond's besides that there had been somebody to dinner at colonel chiley's almost every day but then there were only county people at sir john's and mr bury's guests naturally counted for very little in grange laneindeed it was confidently reported that the rector had invited mr tufton of salem chapel to meet the archdeacon and that but for the dissenting minister having more sense and knowing his place that unseemly conjunction would have taken place to the horror of all rightthinking people
so that dr marjoribanks's was in reality the first house where he had any chance of seeing society
it would perhaps be using too strong a word to say that miss marjoribanks was anxious about the success of her arrangements for this particular evening but at the same time it must be admitted that the circumstances were such as to justify a little anxiety
mr cavendish was gone who to do him justice was always agreeable and his departure disturbed the habitual party and mrs woodburn had lost all her powers as it seemed and sat at dr marjoribanks's left hand looking just like other people and evidently not to be in the least depended on and lucilla was aware that barbara was not coming which made if nothing else a change in the programme
no music nobody to do the flirting nor to supply the dramatic byplay to which grange lane had become accustomed and a new man to be made use of and to be done honour to and introduced in society
a young woman of powers inferior to those of miss marjoribanks would have sunk under such a weight of responsibility and there was no doubt that lucilla was a little excited
she felt that everything depended upon her courage and selfpossession
if she but lost her head for a moment and lost command of affairs everything might have been lost but then fortunately she knew herself and what she could do and had a modest confidence that she would not lose her head and thus she could still eat her dinner with the composure of genius though it would be wrong to deny that lucilla was a little pale
and then as if all these things had not been enough to discourage the lady of the house another discordant element was added by the presence of mr bury and his sister whom it had been necessary to ask to meet the archdeacon
the rector though he was very lowchurch has no particular objections to a good dinnerbut he made a principle of talking of that important daily necessity in a disparaging or at best in a patronising way which roused dr marjoribanks's temper and sometimes the doctor would launch a shaft of medical wit at his spiritual guide which mr bury had no means of parrying
nor was this the only danger to which the peace of the party was exposed
for the rector at the same time regarded mr beverley with a certain critical suspiciousness such as is seldom to be encountered except among clergymen
he did not know much about his clerical superior who had only recently been appointed to his archdeaconry but there was something in his air his looks and demeanour which indicated what mr bury considered a loose way of thinking
when the archdeacon made any remark the rector would pause and look up from his plate to listen to it with his fork suspended in the air the whileand then he would exchange glances with his sister who was on the other side of the table
all this it may be supposed was a little discomposing for lucilla who had the responsibility of everything and who could now look for no assistance among the ordinary members of her father's party who were as a general rule much more occupied with the dinner than with anything else that was going on
in such a state of affairs it was a great relief to miss marjoribanks when the archdeacon who occupied the post of honour by her side made a lively new beginning in the conversation
it had not to call flagged beforenot precisely flaggedbut still there were indications of approaching exhaustion such as can always be perceived half a mile off by anybody who has any experience in society and when the archdeacon took up the ball with all the liveliness of a man who is interested in a special question it will not be difficult to any lady who has ever been in such circumstances to realise to herself miss marjoribanks's sense of gratitude and relief
by the bye said mr beverley i meant to ask if any one knew a man whom i am sure i caught a glimpse of the first day i was in carlingford
perhaps it was in the morning after i arrived to be precise
i can't recollect exactly
if he lives about here he ought to be known for he is a clever amusing sort of fellow
i don't know if carlingford is more blessed than other country towns with people of that complexion said the archdeacon turning to lucilla with a smile
his smile as he paused and turned to miss marjoribanks was such as conveys a kind of challenge when it is addressed to a young lady and meant to lead to a lively little combat by the way and yet there was something of keen personal anxiety and animosity in it
as for lucilla she was conscious of an immediate thrill of curiosity but still it was curiosity unmingled with any excitement and she had no particular objection to respond
everybody is nice in carlingford said miss marjoribanks some people are always finding fault with their neighbours but i always get on so well with everybodyi suppose it is my luck
this was not precisely an answer to the archdeacon's question and there was somebody at the table who could have fallen upon lucilla and beaten her for putting off the revelation which trembled on the lips of mr beverley and yet would have given anything in the world to silence the archdeacon and felt capable of rushing at him like a fury and tearing his tongue out or suffocating him to stop the next words that he was going to say
but nobody knew anything about this or could see into the one heart that had begun to flutter and throb with alarm for outwardly all the welldressed cheerful people at dr marjoribanks's table sat eating their dinner one precisely like another as if there had been no such thing as mystery or terror in the world
you must not expect me to believe in the perfection of human society said the archdeacon going on in the same strain i would much rather pin my faith to the amiable dispositions of one young lady who always finds her neighbours agreeableand i hope she makes no exception to the rule said the broadchurchman in a parenthesis with a smile and a bowand then he raised his voice a little the man i speak of is really a very amusing fellow and very well got up and calculated to impose upon ordinary observers
it is quite a curious story he was a son of a trainer or something of that sort about newmarket
old lord monmouth took an extraordinary fancy to him and had him constantly about his placeat one time indeed he half brought him up along with his grandson you know
he always was a handsome fellow and picked up a little polish and really for people not quite used to the real thing was as nearly like a gentleman  come now i don't put any faith in that said mr woodburn
i don't pretend to be much of a one for fine company myself but i know a gentleman when i see him a snob always overdoes it you know  i never said this man was a snob said the archdeacon with a refined expression of disgust at the interruption flitting over his features on the contrary if he had only been honest he would have been really a very nice fellow  my dear sir said mr bury excuse me for breaking inperhaps i am oldfashioned but don't you think it's a pity to treat the question of honesty so lightly
a dishonest person has a precious soul to be saved and may be a most deeply interesting character but to speak of him as a very nice fellow ispardon mei think it's a pity especially in mixed society where it is so important for a clergyman to be guarded in his expressions said the rector
when mr bury began to speak everybody else at table ceased talking and gave serious attention to what was going on for the prospect of a passage of arms between the two clergymen was an opportunity too captivating to be lost
i hope mr bury's dishonest friends will pardon me said the archdeacon i mean no harm to their superior claims
does anybody know the man here i wonder
he had changed his name when i knew him and there is no telling what he may call himself now
i assure you he was a very goodlooking fellowdark good features nearly six feet high  oh please don't say any more said miss marjoribanks and she could not quite have explained why she interrupted these personal details if you tell me what he is like i shall fancy everybody i meet is him mr centum is dark and has good features and is nearly six feet high
never mind what he is like you gentlemen can never describe anybodyyou always keep to generals tell us what he has done
somebody drew a long breath at the table when the archdeacon obeyed miss marjoribanks's injunction
more than one person caught the sound but even lucilla's keen eyes could not make out beyond controversy from whom it proceeded
to be sure lucilla's mind was in a most curious state of tumult and confusion
she was not one of the people who take a long time to form their conclusions but the natural conclusion to which she felt inclined to jump in this case was one so monstrous and incredible that miss marjoribanks felt her only safeguard in the whirl of possibilities was to reject it altogether and make up her mind that it was impossible and then all the correspondences and apparent corroborations began to dance and whirl about her in a bewildering ring till her own brain seemed to spin with them
she was as much afraid lest the archdeacon by some chance should fall upon a really individual feature which the world in general could identify as if she had had any real concern in the matter
but then fortunately there was not much chance of that for it was one of lucilla's principles that men never can describe each other
she listened however with such a curious commotion in her mind that she did not quite make out what he was saying and only pieced it up in little bits from memory afterwards
not that it was a very dreadful story
it was not a narrative of robbery or murder or anything very alarming but if it could by any possibility turn out that the man of whom mr beverley was speaking had ever been received in society in carlingford then it would be a dreadful blow to the community and destroy public confidence for ever in the social leaders
this was what lucilla was thinking in her sudden turmoil of amazement and apprehension
and all this time there was another person at table who knew all about it twenty times better than lucilla and knew what was coming and had a still more intense terror lest some personal detail might drop from the archdeacon's lips which the public in general would recognise
mr beverley went on with his story with a curious sort of personal keenness in his way of telling it but never dreaming for a moment that anybody that heard him was disturbed or excited by it
he has a mark on his face the archdeacon saidbut here miss marjoribanks gave a little cry and held up both her hands in dismay
don't tell us what marks he has on his face said lucilla
i know that i shall think every man who is dark and has good features and is six feet must be him
i wonder if it could be my cousin tom he has a little mark on his faceand it would be just like his dreadful luck poor fellow
would it be right to give up one's own cousin if it should turn out to be tom
said miss marjoribanks
the people who were sitting at her end of the table laughed but there was no laughing in lucilla's mind
and this fright and panic were poor preparatives for the evening which had to be got through creditably with so few resources and with such a total reversal of the ordinary programme
miss marjoribanks was still tingling with curiosity and alarm when she rose from the table
if it should really come to pass that an adventurer had been received into the best society of carlingford and that the best judges had not been able to discriminate between the false and true how could any one expect that grange lane would continue to confide its most important arrangements to such incompetent hands
such was the dreadful question that occupied all lucilla's thoughts
so far as the adventurer himself was concerned no doubt he deserved anything that might come upon him but the judgment which might overtake the careless shepherds who had admitted the wolf into the fold was much more in miss marjoribanks's mind than any question of abstract justice
so that it was not entirely with a philanthropical intention that she stopped mr beverley and put an end to his dangerous details
now she came to think of it she began to remember that nobody of her acquaintance had any mark on his face but still it was best not to inquire too closely
it was thus with a preoccupied mind that she went up to the drawingroom feeling less in spirits for her work than on any previous occasion
it was the first of the unlucky nights which every woman of lucilla's large and publicspirited views must calculate upon as inevitable now and then
there was no moon and the richmonds naturally were absent and so were the miss browns who were staying there on a visitfor it was after the engagement between lydia and john and mr cavendish was away though perhaps under the circumstances that was no disadvantage and mrs woodburn was silenced and even barbara lake had failed her patroness
footnote  it may be mentioned here that this was an engagement that none of the friends approved of and that it was the greatest possible comfort to miss marjoribanks's mind that she had nothing to do with iteither one way or another as she said
you are not in spirits tonight lucilla my poor dear said mrs chiley as they went upstairs and the kind old lady cast a fierce glance at mrs woodburn who was going before them with miss bury as if it could be her fault
dear mrs chiley said miss marjoribanks i am in perfect spirits it is only the responsibility you know
poor barbara is ill and we can't have any music and what if people should be bored
when one has real friends to stand by one it is different said lucilla with an intonation that was not intended for mrs chiley and i always stand by my friends
this was the spirit with which miss marjoribanks went upstairs
it was a sentiment which pervaded her whole life
even when she had occasion to be sufficiently displeased with the people who surrounded her and to feel that her own loyal friendship met with no adequate response this was the unfailing inspiration of her heart
she did not rush into opposition because any misguided man or woman failed for the moment to appreciate her efforts and return as they ought to have been glad to do her sentiments of kindness
on the contrary nothing could have been more longsuffering and tolerant and benign than the feelings with which lucilla regarded the unfortunate persons who mistook or did not appreciate her
she knew herself which however superior they might be was something they could not know and she could afford to be sorry for their own sakes for their want of discrimination
if there should happen to be somebody in grange lane who had gained admittance into society under false pretences not even such an offence grievous as it was could induce miss marjoribanks to condemn the culprit unheard
it was at once her settled resolution and a peculiarity of her character to stand by her friends and whatever might be the thoughts in her own mind her immediate decision was to shut her ears to every indication of the culprit's personality and to be blind to every suggestion that could identify him
people who like to discover the alloy which blends with all human motives may suppose that lucilla felt her own credit as the leader of society at stake and would not admit that she had been duped
but this had in reality but a very small share in the matter
her instinct even when reason suggested that she should be doubtful of them was always to side with her own friends and though there might be persons included in that sacred number who were scarcely worthy of the character yet lucilla like every lofty character could act but according to her own nature and could not forsake any one whom she supposed to be thus mysteriously and darkly assailed
and she had her reward
there are virtues in this world which go without any recompense but there are other virtues upon which a prompt guerdon is bestowed and lucilla possessed this happier development
whether it was that little speech of hers which touched the mimic's heart or whether the effect was produced by some other secret influence it is certain that this was the night on which mrs woodburn's talent came to what may be called a sort of apotheosis
she shook off her languor as by a sudden inspiration and gave such a sketch of the archdeacon as up to this day is remembered more clearly in carlingford than the man himself
she took him off to his very face and he never found it out though everybody else did and the house shook with restrained laughter
and as if this was not enough rose lake had come with her portfolio with some sketches of her brother's who afterwards became so celebrated in it which electrified all the people who were fond of art and by the side of the young preraphaelite was barbara who had come to spite lucilla and who remained unwittingly to grace her triumph
she stood by herself all wan and crumpled all the night showing her disappointment and rage and jilted state so clearly in her face as to afford to all the mammas in her neighbourhood a most startling example of the danger of showing your feelings with which to point a moral to the other young people about
she had come because rose was coming and she would not be eclipsed by her younger sister
but nobody took any notice of barbara on this miserable evening nobody asked her to sing or offered her a seat or even spoke to her except lucilla who in her magnanimity found time to say a word as she passed
she was carelessly dressed and her hair was hastily arranged and her eyes were red
she had no desire to look as if she had not been jilted and had no proper pride as rose said and mrs chiley who was lucilla's partisan and champion and who thought poor barbara deserved it all seized the opportunity and delivered a little lecture on the subject to the first group of girls who came in her way
a disappointment may happen to any one said mrs chiley and so long as they had done nothing unbecoming nobody could blame them but my dears whatever you do don't show it like that
it makes me ashamed of my sex
and only look at lucilla
said the old lady
lucilla had the best of it now
instead of a failure such as for a moment seemed likely she had a triumphant success
she and she only said a word of kindness to her formerly triumphant rival
she drove her chariot over barbara and drew an advantage even from her sullen looks and red eyes
and the only thing that dissatisfied mrs chiley in the entire course of the evening was the trustful confidence with which miss marjoribanks left the archdeacon the possible new candidate for her favour beside the lakes and their portfolio of drawings
in this as in all other things lucilla could not but follow the dictates of her magnanimous nature
and even her own prospects as her old friend lamented were as nothing to her in comparison with the good of society
experience ought to have taught her better but then experience rarely does that amount of practical good which is generally attributed to it in the world
lucilla gave little rose the fullest opportunity of showing her drawings to the archdeacon and awakening his curiosity and even securing his affections as the jealous observer thought and everybody knows how little is necessary if a young woman likes to exert herself to lead a poor man to his undoing and mr beverley though an archdeacon was most probably in this respect at least no wiser than other men
this was the painful aspect of the case which mrs chiley discussed with her husband when they got home
he is not like what clergymen were in our day said the old lady but still he is very nice and has a nice position and it would just suit lucilla but to think of her going and leaving him with these lake girls notwithstanding the lesson she has had
and i have no doubt the little one is just as designing and nasty as the other
if it should come to anything she has only herself to blame said mrs chiley
as for the colonel he took it more calmly as a gentleman might be expected to do
you may trust a parson for that said the old soldier
he knows what he is about
you will never find him make such an ass of himself as young cavendish did
but this only made mrs chiley sigh the more
poor mr cavendish
said the old lady
i will never blame him poor fellow
it was all that deceitful thing laying her snares for him
for my part i never like to have anything to do with those artist kind of peoplethey are all adventurers said the colonel's wife and she went to bed with this unchristian persuasion in her mind
while every one else regarded the matter with to some extent a personal bias the only person who looked at it abstractly and contemplated not the accidents of an evening but the work itself which was progressing in the face of all kinds of social difficulties was the mastermind which first conceived the grand design of turning the chaotic elements of society in carlingford into one grand unity
lucilla was not blind to the dangers that surrounded her nor indifferent to the partial disappointment she had undergone but she saw that in spite of all her great work was making progress
and when we announce that miss marjoribanks herself was satisfied there remains little more to say
as for the archdeacon he as was natural knew nothing about the matter
he said again with the natural obtuseness which is so general among the gentlemen that it had been a very pleasant party
she has a fine clear candid nature said mr beverley which certainly was better than pronouncing solemnly that she was a good woman which was what he said of mrs chiley and lady richmond in the lump as it were without considering how unlike they were to each other
that was all he being only a man knew about it
but though lucilla was satisfied with the events of the evening it would be vain to deny that there were perturbations in her mind as she laid her head upon her maiden pillow
she said to herself again with profounder fervour that fortunately her affections had not been engaged but there were more things than affections to be taken into consideration
could it be possible that mystery and perhaps imposture of one kind or another had crossed the sacred threshold of grange lane and that people might find out and cast in lucilla's face the dreadful discovery that a man had been received in her house who was not what he appeared to be
when such an idea crossed her mind miss marjoribanks shivered under her satin quilt
of course she could not change the nature of the fact one way or another but at least it was her duty to act with great circumspection so that if possible it might not be found outfor lucilla appreciated fully the difference that exists between wrong and discovery
if any man was imposing upon his neighbours and telling lies about himself it was his own fault but if a leader of society were to betray the fact of having received and petted such a person then the responsibility was on her shoulders
and softer thoughts mingled with these prudential considerationsthat sweet yet stern resolution to stand by her friends which miss marjoribanks had this evening expressed and that sense of pity for everybody who is unfortunate which asserts itself even in the strongest of female intelligences
on the whole it was clear that prudence was the great thing required and a determination not to give too hasty heed to anything nor to put herself in the wrong by any alarmist policy
fortunately the respectability of dr marjoribanks's house was enough to cover its guests with a shining buckler
thus lucilla calmed down her own apprehensions and succeeded in convincing herself that if the impostor whom the archdeacon had seen had been really received in grange lane it was so much the worse for the impostor but that in the meantime in the lack of evidence it was much the best thing to take no notice
if there was any one else in carlingford who regarded that past danger with a livelier horror and a more distinct fear certainly miss marjoribanks had no way of knowing of it and nobody had been remarked as being in a despondent condition or indeed in anything but the highest spirits in the course of this thursday except the ungrateful creature who had begun all the mischief and tolerant as lucilla was it would have been going beyond the limits of nature to have expected that she could have been profoundly sorry for barbara lake
at the same time poor barbara though she was not an elevated character had gone home in a very sad state of mind
she had taken courage to ask mrs woodburn about her brother and mrs woodburn had made the very briefest and rudest response to her question and had taken off her woebegone looks almost to her very face
and no one had shown the least sympathy for the forsaken one
she had not even been called from her solitude to sing which might have been something and it was rose as she said to herself who had attracted all the attention for like most selfish people barbara though keenly aware of her own wrongs had no eyes to perceive that rose who had a proud little spirit was anything but satisfied with the evening's entertainment to which she had herself so largely contributed
i feel as if i should never see him more barbara said quite subdued and broken down with a burst of tears as the two went home and poor little rose who was softhearted forgot all her disapprobation in sympathy
never mind them dear they have no feeling
we must cling together all the closer and try to be everything to each other rose said with eyes which were full but which would not shed any tears
what was passing through her own mind was that it was not for herself but for her portfolio and the talk that arose over it that lucilla had asked her but at the same time she said to herself that all that was nothing in comparison to the wound of the heart under which barbara was suffering
dear never mind we will be everything to each other said poor little romantic rose and the elder sister even in the depths of her dejection could have given her a good shake for uttering such an absurd sentiment for a great deal of good it would do to be everything to each otheras if that could ever replace the orange blossoms and the wedding tour and the carriage and handsome house which were included in the name of cavendish
and he was such a dear
she said to herself in her own mind and wept and made her eyes redder and redder
if mr cavendish had known all that was going on in carlingford that night the chances are that he would have been most flattered by those tears which barbara shed for him under the lamps in grove street but then it is to be hoped he would not have been insensible either to the just reticence and selfrestraint which mingling with miss marjoribanks's suspicions prevented her as she herself said even in the deepest seclusion of her own thoughts from naming any name
chapter xix   but lucilla's good luck and powers of persuasion were such that after a while she even succeeded in convincing little rose lake of the perfect reasonableness and indeed necessity of sacrificing herself to the public interests of the community
as for enjoying it miss marjoribanks said that is quite a different matter
now and then perhaps for a minute one enjoys it but that is not what i am thinking of
one owes something to one's fellowcreatures you know and if it made the evening go off well i should not mind in the least to be hustled up in a corner and contradicted
to be sure i don't remember that it ever happened to me but then i have such luck and i am sure i give you full leave to box the archdeacon's ears next thursday or to tell him he does not know anything in the world about art said miss marjoribanks thoughtfully with a new combination rising in her mind
thank you lucilla said rose but i shall not come back again
i am much obliged to you
it does not do for people who have work to do
my time is all i have and i cannot afford to waste it especially  rose said miss marjoribanks how are you ever to be an artist if you do not know life
that is just the very reason why you ought to go out into the world and i don't see for my part that it matters whether it is pleasant or not
to practise scales all day long is anything but pleasant but then one has to do it you know
i don't blame you said lucilla with tender condescension
you are a dear little thing and you don't know any better but i went through political economy and learnt all about thatyou don't think i choose it for the pleasure
but you all know what is the object of my life and i hope i am not one to shrink from my duty miss marjoribanks added
and it was difficult to reply to such a sublime declaration
little rose left her friend with the conviction that it was her duty too to sacrifice herself for the benefit of society and the advancement of art
such were the lofty sentiments elicited naturally as enthusiasm responds to enthusiasm by lucilla's selfdevotion
already although she was not much more than twenty she had the consoling consciousness that she had wrought a great work in carlingford and if miss marjoribanks required a little sacrifice from her assistants she did not shrink from making the same in her own person as has been shadowed forth in the case of mr cavendish and as will yet in the course of this history be still more seriously and even sadly evolved
three weeks had passed in this way making it still more and more visible to lucilla how much she had lost in losing mr cavendish of whom nothing as yet had been heard when suddenly one day about luncheontime at the hour when miss marjoribanks was known to be at home the drawingroom door opened without any warning and the missing man walked in
it was thus that lucilla herself described the unexpected apparition which appeared to her to have dropped from the clouds
she avowed afterwards to mrs chiley that his entrance was so utterly unexpected so noiseless and without warning that she felt quite silly and could not tell in the least how she behaved though the friends of miss marjoribanks it is to be hoped are too well acquainted with her promptitude of mind and action to imagine that she in any way compromised herself even under the surprise of the moment
as for mr cavendish he exhibited a certain mixture of timidity and excitement which it was remarkable and indeed rather flattering for any lady to see in such an accomplished man of the world
lucilla was not a person to deceive herself nor did she want experience in such matters as has been already shown but it would be vain to deny that the conviction forced upon her mind by the demeanour of her visitor was that it was a man about to propose who thus made his unlookedfor appearance before her
she confessed afterwards to her confidential friend that he had all the signs of it in his looks and manners
he gave that little nervous cough lucilla said and pulled his cravat just so and stared into his hat as if he had it all written down there and looked as they always look miss marjoribanks added with a touch of natural contempt
nor was this all the change in mr cavendish's appearance
he had managed miraculously in his month's absence to grow the most charming little moustache and beard which were to be sure slightly red like most people's
it gleamed into miss marjoribanks's mind in a moment that people did such things sometimes by way of disguising themselves but if such had been mr cavendish's intention it had utterly failed since he seemed rather more like himself than before in lucilla's opinion and certainly was more likely to attract attention since beards were not so usual in these days
they met on the very spot where lucilla had seen him last with that look of insane terror on his handsome face
and the archdeacon was still in carlingford if it was he who had occasioned such a panic
mr cavendish came in as if he had never been absent as if he had seen miss marjoribanks on the previous night and had no fear of anything in the world but of failing to please her and lucilla fortunately saw the nature of the position and was not to be put out even by such an emergency
of course under the circumstances to accept him was utterly out of the question but at the same time lucilla did not feel it expedient without much more distinct information to put a definitive and cruel negative on mr cavendish's hopes
as for barbara lake that was a trifle not worth thinking of and notwithstanding that there was something rather unaccountable in his conduct he was still the probable member for carlingford just as mrs chiley so often said the position which of all others she would have chosen for lucilla so that miss marjoribanks was not prepared without due consideration to bring the matter to a final end
while lucilla made this rapid summary of affairs and took her stand in her own mind mr cavendish had taken a chair and had opened the conversation
he hoped he had not been entirely forgotten though a fortnight's absence was a severe tax on anybody's memory  a fortnight
said miss marjoribanks how happy you must have been while you have been awayfor i assure you a month is a month at carlingford and one does not get such ornaments in two weeks said lucilla putting her hand to her chin which made mr cavendish laugh and look more nervous than ever
it is a souvenir of where i have been he said
i could imagine i had been gone two years judging by my own feelings
i am so pleased to see that you remember how long it is
i dare say it looked a little droll running away so but i dared not trust myself with leavetakings mr cavendish said with an air of sentiment
i have been watching over a poor friend of mine on his sickbed
he was once very good to me and when he sent for me i could not delay or refuse him
i found he had telegraphed for me when i got home the last thursday evening i was here he continued looking lucilla full in the face with the candour of conscious truththough to be sure when people are stating a simple fact it is seldom that they take the pains to be so particular
i started by the nighttrain and crossed the channel while you were all fast asleep
i wonder if any one gave me a thought continued mr cavendish and it was still more and more impressed upon lucilla that he had all the signs of a man who had come to propose
i cannot say about that night in particular but i am sure a great many people have given you a thought said miss marjoribanks
we have all been wondering what had become of you where you were and when you were coming back
so far as i am concerned i have missed you dreadfully said lucilla with her usual openness and she really thought for a moment that mr cavendish in a sudden transport was going down on his knees
i scarcely hoped for so much happiness he said and though he kept up the tone proper to good society which might mean sport or earnest according as the occasion required there was a certain air of gratitude and tenderness in his face which sent lucilla's active mind awondering
he is thinking of the musicstand she said to herself and then went on with what she was saying for though miss marjoribanks had a very good opinion of herself it had not occurred to her that mr cavendish was very deeply in lovewith her at all events
ah yesnot only for the flirting you know which of itself is a dreadful loss but then you were so good in keeping the gentlemen to their duty
i missed you dreadfullythere has been nobody at all to help me said lucilla
her tone was so genuinely plaintive that mr cavendish grew more and more moved
he put down his hat he cleared his throat he got up and walked to the windowevidently he was getting up his courage for the last step
but i heard you had some distinguished strangers here he said coming back to his seat without having as it appeared made up his mind
my sister wrotethat is to say i heardi really don't remember how i got the news a dean or bishop or something
oh yes mr archdeacon beverley he came precisely the night you went away said lucilla
didn't you see him
i thought you stayed till after he came into the room
a nice clergyman is very nice you know but after all a man who has some experience in societyand we have had no music to speak of since you went away
poor dear barbara has had such a bad cold
in short we have all been at sixes and sevens and the archdeacon  oh never mind the archdeacon said mr cavendish and miss marjoribanks felt that he had not winced at the name though he did glance up at her in spite of himself with a little gleam in his eyes when she mentioned barbara lake
perhaps this was because he knew nothing about the archdeacon perhaps because he was prepared to hear the archdeacon named
lucilla did not give him all the benefit of the uncertainty for she began to get a little impatient and to wonder if the man had come to propose as appearances suggested why he did not do it and get done with itwhich was a very reasonable question
this time however it certainly was coming
i don't like nice clergymen said mr cavendish especially not when it is you who find them so
if i could really flatter myself that you missed me  we all did said lucilla there is no compliment about it and poor dear barbara has had such a cold  ah
said the unfortunate aspirant and once more he gave a doubtful glance at lucilladecidedly the name of barbara had more effect upon him than that of the archdeacon
it seemed to damp his fire and smother the words on his lips and he had to take another promenade to the window to recover himself
after that however he came back evidently wound up and determined and his eyes as he returned to miss marjoribanks's side fell upon the musicstand by means of which she had covered his fright and flight if it was not a mere hallucination on lucilla's part that he had been frightened and had fled on the night he left carlingford
he came back with the air of a man who means to delay and deliberate no more
if i could flatter myself that you had missed me he said younot any one elsei might have the courage to ask  it was at that precise moment of all moments that mrs chiley whom they had not heard coming upstairs though she was sufficiently audible suddenly opened the door
mr cavendish as was natural broke off in a moment with a face which had turned crimson and even lucilla herself felt a little annoyed and put out when as in duty bound she got up to meet and welcome her old friend
one thing was fortunate as miss marjoribanks afterwards reflected that since it was to be interrupted it had been interrupted so early before he could have put himself in any ridiculous attitude for example for at such moments it is well known that some men go down upon their kneesor at least such is the ineradicable belief of womankind
if mr cavendish had been on his kneesthough to tell the truth he was not a very likely subjectthe position would have been much more embarrassing
but as it was there was an end
he turned back again to the window biting his glove in the most frantic way and taking up his hat while she always mistress of the position advanced to the newcomer with outstretched hands
i know you have come to have lunch with me said lucilla
you are always so nicejust when i wanted you for of course i dared not have asked mr cavendish to go downstairs if i had been all alone
mr cavendish
cried the old lady with a little scream
so he has really come back
i am so glad to see you
i can't tell you how glad i am to see you and i declare with a beard
oh you need not blush for what i say
i am old enough to be both your grandmothers and i am so glad to see you together again
said mrs chiley with an imprudent effusion of sentiment
and it may be imagined what the effect of this utterance was upon the suitor whose lovemaking if he was really going to make love was thus cut short in the bud
he coughed more than ever when he shook hands with the newcomer and kept fast hold of his hat with that despairing grasp which is common to men in trouble
and then he kept looking at the door as if he expected some one else to come in or wanted to escape and so far from following up his interrupted address by any explanatory or regretful glances he never even looked at lucilla which to be sure struck her as odd enough
miss marjoribanks is very good he said and i am very glad to see you so soon after my return mrs chileythough of course i should have called but i may have to go away in a day or two and i am afraid i cannot have the pleasure of staying to lunch
oh yes you must stay said mrs chiley i want to hear all about it
go away again in a day or two
if i were lucilla i would not let you go away
she is queen now in carlingford you knowand then poor old mr chiltern is so ill
i hope you won't think of going away
they all say it would be such a pity if anything happened to him while you were away
tell me where you have been and what you have been doing all this time
we have missed you so dreadfully
and now you look quite like a military man with that beard
i have been nursing a sick friendon the continent said mr cavendish not very cheerful work
i am sorry about mr chiltern but i cannot help it
i have doubts now whether even if he were to die i should offer myself
i couldn't give pledges to all the shopkeepers about my opinions said the embarrassed man and as he spoke he put his hat against his breast like a buckler
i must not detain you from your lunch
goodbye miss marjoribanks i am very sorry i can't stay
but dear me stop a minutedon't run away from us said mrs chiley
come and talk it all over with the colonel there is a dearand don't do anything rash
goodbye if you will go said the old lady
she sat with a look of consternation in her face looking at miss marjoribanks as he made his way downstairs
did i come in at a wrong time lucilla
said mrs chiley in distress
have you refused him my dear
what is the matter
i am so dreadfully afraid i came in at the wrong time
dear mrs chiley said lucilla sweetly you can never come in at a wrong time and it is just as well on the whole that he didn'tfor i was not prepared to give him any answer
i am sure on the contrary it was quite providential miss marjoribanks said but it may be doubted whether lucilla's mind perfectly corresponded to her words on this occasion though she was so amiable about it as mrs chiley afterwards said
for even when a woman has not her answer ready she has always a certain curiosity about a proposal and then when such a delicate matter is crushed in the bud like this who can tell if it will ever blossom again and find full expression
miss marjoribanks could not be said to be disappointed but unquestionably she regretted a little that he had not been permitted to say out his say
as for mrs chiley when she understood all the rights of it she was afflicted beyond measure and could not forgive herself for the unlucky part she had played
if you had only said you were engaged the old lady exclaimed or not at homeor anything lucilla
you know you need never stand on ceremony with me
no wonder he looked as if he could eat me
poor fellow
and i dare say he has gone away with his heart full said mrs chiley with the tenderest sympathy
she could not get over it nor eat any lunch nor think of anything else
poor dear boy
he need not have been so put out with an old woman like me
he might have known if he had given me the least hint or even a look i would have gone away said the kind old woman
but you must be all the kinder to him when he comes back lucilla
and my dear if i were you i would stay in this afternoon
he is sure to come back and i would not keep him in pain
i don't think he will come back lucilla could not help saying for she had a conviction that nothing more would come of it but nevertheless she did stay in that afternoon and received several visits but saw nothing more of mr cavendish
it was rather vexatious to tell the truth for to see a man so near the point and not even to have the satisfaction of refusing him is naturally aggravating to a woman
but miss marjoribanks had far too much philosophy as well as good sense to be vexed on that account with mrs chiley who could not forgive herself and to make up for the consequences of her unlucky visit would have done anything in the world
the old lady herself returned in the afternoon to know the result and was doubly vexed and distressed to hear he had not come back
i ought to be on the archdeacon's side lucilla she said with tears in her eyes
i know i ought when it was i that brought him here but i can't help feeling for the other my dear
he always was so nicea great deal nicer to my way of thinking than mr beverley not to say but that the archdeacon is very agreeable mrs chiley added recollecting herself for in matters of that description a woman of experience is aware that she cannot be too particular about what she says and supposing that mr cavendish did not come back it would never do to prejudice lucilla against the other candidate
i never blamed mr cavendish about that lake girl the old lady continued
it was not his fault poor young man
i know he was always devoted to you in his heart and to think he should come here the very first place as soon as he returned
i only wish i had had one of my headaches this morning my dear to keep me indoors for an old malaprop
i do indeed lucilla
it would have served me right and i should not have minded the pain
but indeed i don't wish anything of the sort said miss marjoribanks
i would not have the best man in the world at the cost of one of those dreadful headaches of yours
it is so good of you to say so but you know very well it is not that sort of thing i am thinking of
if i were to go off and marry just now after all that has been done to the drawingroom and everything i should feel as if i were swindling papa and it is the object of my life to be a comfort to him
yes my dear said mrs chiley but we must not neglect your own interest for all that
i think it is most likely he will come this evening
he has just come from the continent you know where people do make calls in the evening
i meant to have asked you to come down to us as we shall be all alone  all alone
then where is the archdeacon
asked lucilla
he has gone out to sir john's for a day or two my dear said mrs chiley and she could not understand the little gleam of intelligence that shot into lucilla's eye
he left word with me for you that he would be sure to be back before thursday but seeing mr cavendish when i came in made me forget all about it
he would be quite distressed poor man
if he thought i had forgotten to give you his message
i won't ask you now to come down and cheer me up a little lucilla
i think poor mr cavendish is sure to come this evening and i will not stand in his way again
but my dear you must send me a little note after he has been
now promise
i shall be quite in suspense all night
dear mrs chiley i don't think he will come said miss marjoribanks
for my part i think it was providential your coming todayfor i am sure i don't know what i should have said to him
and it is so odd the archdeacon should be away just at this moment
i feel quite sure he will not come tonight
there is nothing odd about the archdeacon said mrs chiley
it was for today he was asked you know that is simple enough
if you are sure that you prefer the archdeacon my dear the old lady added with an anxious look
but lucilla cut short the inquiry which was becoming too serious by bringing her kind visitor a cup of tea
i hope you don't think i prefer any of them said the injured maiden
if i had been thinking of that sort of thing you know i need never have come home
if they would only let one do one's duty in peace and quiet said lucilla with a sigh and to tell the truth both the ladies had occasion on that trying afternoon for the consolation of their cup of tea
but while they were thus refreshing themselves a conversation of a very different kind yet affecting the same interests was being carried on not very far off under the shelter of a little flowery arbour in another of the embowered gardens of grange lane where the subject was just then being discussed from the other side
chapter xx   mr woodburn's house everybody admitted was one of the nicest in carlingford but that was not so visible out of doors as in
he was a great amateur of flowers and fruit and had his garden lined on each side with greenhouses which were no doubt very fine in their way but somewhat spoiled the garden which had not in the least the homely luxuriant oldfashioned look of the other gardens where for the most part the flowers and shrubs grew as if they liked it and were at homewhereas mr woodburn's flowerbeds were occupied only by tenantsatwill but at one corner near the house there was a little arbour so covered up and heaped over with clematis that even the scotch gardener had not the heart to touch it
the mass was so perfect and yet so light that it was the most perfect hidingplace imaginable and nobody who had not been in it could have suspected that there was a possibility of getting inside
here mrs woodburn and mr cavendish were seated on this particular afternoon she very eager animated and in earnest he silent and leaning his head on his two hands in a sort of downcast fallen way
mrs woodburn had one of her lively eyes on the garden that nobody might enter unseen and for this once was taking off no one but was most emphatically and unquestionably herself
so you did not do it she said
why didn't you do it
when you knew so much depended upon it
you know i did not wish for it myself at first
but now since this man has come and you have got into such a panic and never will have the courage to face it out  how can i have the courage to face it out
said mr cavendish with a groan
it is all very easy for a woman to speak who has only to criticise other people
if you had to do it yourself  ah if i only had
cried the sister
you may be sure i would not make so much fuss
after all what is there to do
take your place in society which you have worked for and won as honestly as anybody ever won it and look another man in the face who is not half so clever nor so sensible as you are
why what can he say
if i only could do it you may be sure i should not lose any time
yes said mr cavendish lifting his head
to be sure you're a mimicyou can assume any part you like but i am not so clever
i tell you again the only thing i can do is to go away  run away you mean said mrs woodburn
i should be foolish indeed if i were trusting to your cleverness to assume a part
my dear good brother you would find it impossible to put yourself sufficiently in sympathy with another cried the mimic in the archdeacon's very tone with a laugh and at the same time a little snarl of bitter contempt
oh for heaven's sake nelly no foolery just now said mr cavendish
i don't understand how you can be so heartless
to mimic a man who has my position my reputation my very existence in his hands
have you murdered anybody
said mrs woodburn with intense scorn
have you robbed anybody
if you have i can understand all this stuff
he is the very man to mimic on the contrary
i'd like to let you see him as he was on that famous occasion when he delivered his opinions on art in lucilla's drawingroom
look here said the mimic putting one hand behind an imaginary coat tail and with the other holding up a visionary drawing to the light but this was more than her audience could bear
i think you must have vowed to drive me crazy cried the exasperated brother
put aside for once that confounded vanity of yoursas if a man had always leisure to look at your playing the fool
while he spoke in this unusual way he got up as was natural and took one or two steps across the narrow space which was shut in by those luxuriant heaps of clematis and mrs woodburn for her part withdrew her chair out of his way in equal heat and indignation
you have always the leisure to play the fool yourselves you men she said
vanity indeed
as if it were not simply to show you that one can laugh at him without being stricken with thunder
but leave that if you like
you know quite well if you married lucilla marjoribanks that there would be no more about it
there could be no more about it
why all grange lane would be in a sort of way pledged to you
i don't mean to say i am attached to lucilla but you used to be or to give yourself out for being
you flirted with her dreadfully in the winter i remember when those terrible woodburns were here she continued with a shiver
if you married lucilla and got into parliament you might laugh at all the archdeacons in the world
it is very easy for a woman to talk said the reluctant wooer again
i can tell you something it is not easy to do cried his sister
it is frightfully hard for a woman to stand by and see a set of men making a mess of things and not to dare to say a word till all is spoiled
what is this archdeacon i would like to know or what could he say
if you only would have the least courage and look him in the face he would be disabled
as if no one had ever heard of mistaken identity before
and in the meantime go and see lucilla and get her consent
i can't do that for you but i could do a great deal of the rest if you would only have a little pluck and not give in like this
a little pluck by george
cried the unfortunate man and he threw himself down again upon his chair
i am not in love with lucilla marjoribanks and i don't want to marry her he added doggedly and sat beating a tune with his fingers on the table with but a poorlyassumed air of indifference
as for mrs woodburn she regarded him with a look of contempt
perhaps you will tell me who you are in love with she said disdainfully but i did not ask to be taken into your confidence in such an interesting way
what i wish to know is whether you want a wife who will keep your position for you
i am not in the least fond of her but she is very clever
whether you want the support of all the best people in carlingford and connections that would put all that to silence and a real position of your own which nobody could interfere withthat is what i want to know harry as for the sentimental part i am not so much interested about that said mrs woodburn with a contemptuous smile
she was young still and she was handsome in her way for people who liked that style and it jarred a little on the natural feelings to hear a young wife express herself so disdainfully but to be sure her brother was not unaccustomed to that
you said once that woodburn was necessary to your happiness he said with a mixture of scorn and appeal though i can't say i saw it for my part
did i
she said with a slight shrug of her shoulders i saw what was necessary on another score as you don't seem to do
when a man has nobody belonging to him it is connections he ought to try for and lucilla has very good connections and it would be as good as securing the support of grange lane
do it for my sake harry if you won't do it for your own said mrs woodburn with a change of tone
if you were to let things be said and give people an advantage think what would become of me
woodburn would not mind so much if somebody else were involved but oh harry
if he should find out he had been cheated and he only  he was not cheated
you were always a great deal too good for him nelly said mr cavendish touched at last at an effectual point and as for his friends and family and all that  oh please don't speak of them said mrs woodburn with a shudder but there are only two of us in the world and harry for my sake  at this appeal mr cavendish got up again and began to pace the little arbour two steps to the wall and two steps back again
i told you i had almost done it when that confounded old woman came in he said that could not be called my fault
and she said she was both your grandmothers said the mimic with a slightly hysterical laugh in mrs chiley's voice
i know how she did it
she can't be there still you knowgo now and try
let alone a little don't hurry a fellow said her brother somewhat sullenly a man can't move himself up to the point of proposing twice in one day
then promise that you will do it tomorrow said mrs woodburn
i shall have to go in for there is somebody coming
harry before i go promise that you will do it tomorrow for my sake
oh bother
said mr cavendish and it was all the answer he deigned to give before mrs woodburn was called away notwithstanding the adjuration she addressed to him
it was then getting late too late even had he been disposed for such an exertion to try his fortunes again that day and lucilla's allusion had given him a great longing to see barbara once more before his sacrifice was accomplished
not that it was such a great sacrifice after all
for mr cavendish was quite aware that miss marjoribanks was a far more suitable match for him than barbara lake and he was not even disposed to offer himself and his name and fortune such as they were to the drawingmaster's daughter
but to tell the truth he was not a person of fixed and settled sentiments as he ought to have been in order to triumph as his sister desired over the difficulties of his position
perhaps mrs woodburn herself would have done just the same had it been she from whom action was demanded
but she was capable of much more spirited and determined conduct in theory as was natural and thought she could have done a great deal better as so many women do
mr cavendish lounged about the garden a little with his hands in his pockets and then strayed out quite accidentally and in the same unpremeditating mood made his way to grove street
he meant nothing by it and did not even inquire of himself where he was going but only strolled out to take the air a little
and it was better to go up to the higher parts of the town than to linger here about grange lane where all the people he knew might pass and stop to talk and ask him where he had been and worry his life out
and surely he had had enough of bother for one day
by this time it was getting dark and it was very pleasant in grove street where most of the good people had just watered their little gardens and brought out the sweetness of the mignonette
mr cavendish was not sentimental but still the hour was not without its influence and when he looked at the lights that began to appear in the parlour windows and breathed in the odours from the little gardens it is not to be denied that he asked himself for a moment what was the good of going through all this bother and vexation and whether love in a cottage with a little garden full of mignonette and a tolerable amount of comfort within was not after all a great deal more reasonable than it looked at first sight
this however it must be allowed was no conclusion arrived at on sufficient premises and with the calmness that befitted such an important argument but the mere suggestion by the way of an impatient undecided mind that did always what at the moment it found most agreeable to do and reflected afterwards when the moment of repentance not of reflection had arrived
he had paused by instinct under a lamp not yet lighted which was almost opposite mr lake's house and it was not his fault if he saw at the upper window a figure looking out like mariana and sighing he cometh not
naturally the figure was concerned to find out who he was and he was anxious to find out who was the figure
and on the whole it was in a very innocent manner that this entirely natural curiosity was satisfied
first the window was opened a littlea very little just enough to change the airand mr cavendish down below heard the voice of barbara singing softly up above which settled the matter as to her identity
as to his barbara had never from the first moment she perceived him any doubt of that
her heart leaped back as she thought to its right place when she first caught sight of that blessed apparition and with her heart came the orangeflowers and the wedding breakfast and the veil of real brussels for which barbara had so much wept
she tried to sing something that would convey hope and assurance to her timid lover according to romantic precedent but her mind was far from being a prompt one as has been said
thus it was all in the most natural way that it came about
when mr cavendish felt quite sure who it was he took off his hat which was only civil and made a step or two forward and then barbara took the extreme step of going down to the door
no doubt it was an extreme step
nothing but a great public aim like that of miss marjoribanks could have justified such a measure but then barbara if she had not a great public had at least a decided personal purpose and obeyed the impulse of that mingled inclination towards another and determination to have her own way which in such a mind calls itself passion and which sometimes by sheer force of will succeeds better than either genius or calculation
she went down to the door all palpitating with renewed hope and at the same time with the dread that he might escape her in the moment which was necessary for her passage downstairs
but when she opened the door and appeared with her cheeks glowing and her eyes blazing and her heart thumping in her breast in the midst of that quiet twilight the object of her hopes was still there
he had even advanced a little with an instinctive sense of her approach and thus they met the street being comparatively quiet just then and the mignonette perfuming the air
to be sure the poetry of the situation was of a homely order for it was under a lamppost instead of a tree that the lover had placed himself and it was not the dew but the watering that had brought out the odour of the mignonette but then neither of the two were very poetical personages and the accessories did perfectly well for them
is it you mr cavendish
goodness
i could not think who it was cried barbara out of breath
yes it is i i thought if i had an opportunity i would ask how you werebefore i go away again said the imprudent man
he did not want to commit himself but at the same time he was disposed to take the benefit of his position as a hero on the eve of departure
i heard you had been ill  oh nonot ill said barbara and then she added taking breath i am quite well now
won't you come in
this was the perfectly simple and natural manner in which it occurred
there was nobody in and barbara did not see any more than her lover did why she should sacrifice any of her advantages
they were on the whole quite well matched and stood in need of no special protection on either side
though naturally barbara who felt by this time as if she could almost see the pattern of the real brussels had a much more serious object in view than mr cavendish who went in only because it was a pleasant thing to do at the moment and offered him a little refuge from himself and his deliberations and the decision which it was so necessary to come to
thus it happened that when mr lake and rose came in from the evening walk they had been taking together they found to their great amazement barbara in the little parlour singing to mr cavendish who had forgotten all about grange lane and his dangers and his hopes of better fortune and was quite as much contented with the mellow contralto that delighted his ears and the blazing scarlet bloom and black level brows that pleased his eyes as anybody could have desired
to be sure he had not even yet given a thought to the wedding breakfast which was all arranged already in the mind of the enchantress who thus held him in thrall but perhaps that may be best accounted for by referring it to one of those indefinable peculiarities of difference that exist between the mind of woman and that of man
when mr lake and his daughter came in from their walk and their talk about willie and about art and about the effects and bits which rose and her father mutually pointed out to each other to find this unexpected conjunction in the parlour their surprise and indeed consternation may be imagined
but it was only in the mind of rose that the latter sentiment existed
as for mr lake he had long made up his mind how as he said a man of superior position ought to be received when he made his appearance in an artist's house
perhaps to tell the truth he forgot for the moment that his visitor was young and his daughter very handsome and that it was to visit barbara and not himself that mr cavendish had come
the little drawingmaster would not suffer himself to be seduced by thoughts which were apart from the subject from carrying out his principles
when mr cavendish rose up confused with a look of being caught and found out mr lake held out his hand to him with perfect suavityi have the pleasure of knowing you only by sight said the innocent father but i am very glad to make your acquaintance in my own house and as this was said with the conscious dignity of a man who knows that his house is not just an ordinary house but one that naturally the patrician portion of the community if they only knew it would be glad to seek admittance to the consequence was that mr cavendish felt only the more and more confused
i happened to be passing he explained faintly and having heard that miss lake whom i have had the pleasure of meeting  i assure you said the drawingmaster that i hail with satisfaction the appearance of a gentleman whose intelligence i have heard so much of
we artists are a little limited to be sure for life you know is short and art is long as the poet says and our own occupation requires so much of our thoughts
but still we are sympathetic mr cavendish
we can understand other subjects of study though we cannot share them
yes barbara has been a little poorlybut she does not look as if there was much the matter with her tonight
ask for the lamp rose said mr lake with a little grandeur
there was no light in the room except the candles at the piano which lighted that corner and left the rest of the apartment small as it was in comparative shade
there was something magnificent in the idea of adding the lamp to that illumination but then it is true that as mr lake himself said every artist is a prodigal in his heart
rose had been standing all this time with her hat on looking at mr cavendish like a little gorgon
what did he want here
how had he been admitted
she scorned to go and interrogate the maid which involved a kind of infidelity to her sister but all the same she looked hard at mr cavendish with a severity which had on the whole a reassuring effect upon him
for to tell the truth the benign reception which he was receiving from mr lake instead of setting the visitor at his ease made him nervous for he was not in the least aware of the heroic soul which existed in the drawingmaster's limited person
mr cavendish thought nothing but that he was being caught according to his own vulgar theory
he thought barbara's father was cringing to him and playing the usual mean part of an interested parent who means to secure a good match for his daughter
but as for rose she evidently either from jealousy or some other reason was not in the plot
she stood apart and scowled as well as she knew how upon the intruder
i suppose papa said rose mr cavendish wished to hear barbara sing and she has been singing
she is always very goodnatured in that way but as we have none of us anything particular to do i don't see what need we have for a lamp
at this trenchant speech mr cavendish rose
he was quite grateful to the little preraphaelite for her incivility
it made him feel less as if he had committed himself and more as if he were an intruder which was the more agreeable suggestion of the two under the present circumstances
you remind me that i should thank miss lake for letting me come in and hear once more her lovely voice he said
i am at present only a visitor in carlingford and indeed in englandi may have to leave again in a day or twogoodbye
if i am still here i shall hope to meet you on thursday
and then he pressed barbara's hand who to tell the truth was very reluctant to let him go away
if you must go she said so low that her father could not hear her though the vigilant suspicious little rose caught the sound and came a step nearer like a little dragon as barbara was disposed to think she was
i must go murmured mr cavendish but i shall see youwe shall meet
he dared not say another word so alarming were the looks of the small medusa whose countenance he could see behind barbara regarding the parting
as for mr lake he too regarded it with a momentary curiosity
he did not quite understand how it was that his daughter and his visitor could know each other well enough to communicate in this undertone
i am sorry to see so little of you said mr lake
i am afraid it is my little girl's brusque way of speaking that hastens your going
i assure you we were quite unoccupied and would have been very happyperhaps we may be more fortunate another time and with that the drawingmaster gave a dignified dismissal to his surprising visitor
it was rose herself who saw mr cavendish to the door which she opened for him with an utter disregard of his excuses and attempts to do that office for himself
she would not even shake hands but made him the most majestic curtsey that was ever executed by a personage five feet high under the influence of which mr cavendish went away humbled and he could scarcely tell why ashamed of himself
when rose came back to the parlour still with her hat on she found that barbara had gone to the window and was looking out at the edge of the blindwhich was all that was wanted to put a climax to her sister's exasperation
papa said rose i should like to know in your presence or i should like you to ask barbara herself what is the meaning of all that has been going on tonight
mr lake turned right round at this appeal with an expression of utter amaze and bewilderment which at another moment would have struck rose with the profoundest delight as a study and as for barbara without any more ado she burst into a flood of passionate tears
oh you nasty envious thing
oh you jealous disagreeable thing
sobbed the elder sister to send him away and spoil everything with your airs
when he was as nearjust as nearbut here barbara's voice lost itself in her tears
my dear what does this mean
said mr lake
it means papa that she has encouraged him to come and invited him in and been singing to him cried rose
to think she should be one of us and have no proper pride
if he was fond of her he would tell her so and ask your permission but she is laying herself out to please him and is content that they should all jeer at her in lucilla's parties and say she is trying to catch him
i thought i could have died of shame when i saw him here tonight and compromising you as if that was why you were so civil
if it were for her good do you think i would ever interfere
cried barbara's guardian angel
at this point rose herself would have liked excessively to cry if the truth must be told but barbara had already appropriated that facile mode of expression and the little artist scorned to copy
as for mr lake he turned from one to the other of his daughters with unmitigated consternation and dismay
it was all your coming in sobbed barbara if you had only had the sense to see it
that was what he meant
if i was singing it was just to pass the time i know that was what he came for
and you to send him away with your airs
cried the injured young woman
all this made up a scene entirely novel to the amazed father who felt it his duty to put a stop to it and yet could not tell what to say
girls he began with a trembling voice this is all perfectly new to me
i don't understand
if mr cavendish oror any one wishes to pay his addresses to my daughter it is of course his business to apply to me in the first place
barbara don't cry
you know how i dislike to hear you cry said the poor man gradually losing his head
don't make a fuss rose for heaven's sake girls can't you say at once what you mean and don't worry me to death
ah if your poor mother had but been spared
cried the unfortunate widower and he had five daughters altogether poor souland it was so easy to drive him out of his senses
at this point rose intervened and did what she could to calm matters down
barbara still sobbing retired to her chamber the boys came in from their cricket and the little children had to be put to bed and there was no one to attend to all these matters in the absence of the eldest sister except the little mistress of the school of design so that naturally all further explanation was postponed for this night
chapter xxi   it was thus that mr cavendish without particularly meaning it impressed upon two interesting and amiable young women on the same day the conviction that he was about to propose without in either case realising that expectation
after this last exploit he went home with his head more confused and his will more undecided than ever
for he had one of those perverse minds which cling to everything that is forbidden and the idea that he ought not to have gone near barbara lake and that he ought not to see her again made him more anxious to seek her out and follow her than he had ever been before
if such a thing had been permissible in england as that a man might marry one wife for his liking and another for his interests the matter might have been compromised by proposing to them both and there cannot be a doubt that lucilla in such a case would very soon have triumphed over her handsome sullen passionate rival
but then such a way of conciliating a man with himself does not exist in the british islands and consequently was not to be thought of
and to be sure every time he came to think of it mr cavendish saw more and more clearly what a fool he would be to marry barbara who was evidently so ready to marry him
the same thing could not with any confidence be predicated of miss marjoribanks though if she were to accept him and her father were to consent nothing could be better for his interests
all this he felt and yet an unconquerable reluctance kept him back
his history was not quite spotless and there were chapters in it which he thought it would kill him to have brought before the public of carlingford but still he was far from being a bad fellow in his way
and down at the bottom of his heart out of everybody's sight and unacknowledged even by himself there was one little private nook full of gratitude to lucilla
though he scarcely knew what was passing at the moment he knew when he came to think of it that she had saved him from the effects of his first panic at the unexpected appearance of mr beverley
perhaps it was partly this consciousness that made him so embarrassed in her presence and he could not find it in his heart with this sense of gratitude to deceive her and say he loved her and ask her to marry him
to be sure if mr cavendish had been a very acute observer he might have felt that lucilla was quite able to take care of herself in such an emergency and was at the least a match for him however seductive he might appear to others but then few people are acute observers in a matter so entirely personal to themselves
he felt furious with himself as he went home and thought how foolish he had been ever to go near barbara lake in the present position of affairs and yet he could not help feeling that it was more delightful to him to see the colour blaze into her cheeks and the song rise like a bird from her full crimson lips and that flush of excitement and triumph come from her eyes than it could have been in any case to have been admitted to the same degree of intimacy with lucilla who was not in the least intoxicated by his presence
thus the unfortunate man was torn asunder not so much by love and duty as by inclination and interest though the inclination was not strong enough to have allowed of any great sacrifice nor the interest sufficiently certain to have repaid the exertion
this only made it the more difficult to decide and in his circumstances and with the panic that pursued him he did not feel it possible to adopt the only wise policy that remained to him and wait
as mr cavendish was thus making his way home horribly vexed and annoyed with himself and avoiding grange lane as if the plague was in it miss marjoribanks sat in her drawingroom alone and thought the matter over
certainly she had not expected him that evening but still when she heard ten o'clock strike and felt that his coming now absolutely impossible she was a littlenot exactly disappointed but annoyed at herself for having felt a sort of expectation
lucilla was not a person to hide her sentiments or even to conceal a fact which was disagreeable to her amour propre
she had too thorough and wellfounded a confidence in the natural interest of the world in all belonging to her to do that so when ten o'clock had done striking she opened her blottingbook and took one of her pretty sheets of paper with lucilla on it in delicate rosetinted letters the l very large and the concluding letters very small and dashed off her note to mrs chiley
the miss blounts' at mount pleasant had been one of the very first establishments to forsake the handwriting which was all corners in favour of the bold running hand of the present female generation and it was accordingly in a very free and stronglycharacterised manuscript black with much ink that miss marjoribanks wrote       dearest mrs chileyi never expected him to come and he has not
i dare say he never meant it
i am so glad
it was providence that      sent you at that particular moment todayalways in haste with      fond love your most truly affectionate       lucilla
and when she had sent thomas with this note miss marjoribanks felt her mind relieved
not that it had been much distressed before but when she had put it in black and white and concluded upon it her satisfaction was more complete and no such troublous thoughts as those which disturbed the hero of this day's transactionsno such wild tears as poured from the eyes of barbara lakeinterfered with the maidenly composure of lucilla's meditations
notwithstanding all that people say to the contrary there is a power in virtue which makes itself felt in such an emergency
miss marjoribanks could turn from mr cavendish who had thus failed to fulfil the demands of his position to the serene idea of the archdeacon with that delightful consciousness of having nothing to reproach herself with which is balm to a wellregulated mind
she had done her duty whatever happened
she had not injudiciously discouraged nor encouraged the possible member for carlingford and at the same time she was perfectly free to turn her attention to the possible bishop and neither in one case nor the other could anybody say that she had gone a step too far or committed herself in any way whatsoever
while these consoling reflections were passing through lucilla's mind dr marjoribanks came upstairs as had grown to be his custom lately
sometimes he took a cup of tea though it was against his principles and sometimes he only sat by while his daughter had hers and amused himself with her chat before he went to bed
he was later than usual tonight and naturally the teatray had disappeared some time before
as for lucilla she did not for a moment permit her own preoccupation to interfere with the discharge of her immediate duty which was unquestionably to be amusing and agreeable and a comfort to her dear papa
so you had cavendish here today
said the doctor
what brought him here
what has he been doing
since you and he are on such good terms i hope he gave you an account of where he has been
he has been nursing a sick friend onthe continent said lucilla with that largeness of geographical expression which is natural to the insular mind
who are mr cavendish's friends papa
added miss marjoribanks with confiding simplicity and it was beautiful to see how the daughter looked up into her father's face with that angelic confidence in his knowledge on all subjects which is so rarely to be met with in the present generation
but it was not a question to which the doctor found it easy to respond
who are his friends
said dr marjoribanks
he's one of the cavendishes they say
we have all heard that
i never knew he had any friends which is after all next best to having very good ones said the philosophical old scotchman and there as it appeared he was quite content to let the matter drop
i like to know who people belong to for my part said lucilla
the archdeacon for example one knows all about his friends
it's a great deal nicer you know papa
not that it matters in the least about the cavendishes  well i should have thought not after the way you made an end of him said the doctor
i hope he doesn't mean to begin that nonsense over again lucilla
he is a good fellow enough and i don't mind asking him to my house but it is quite a different thing to give him my daughter
he spends too much money and i can't see what real bottom he has
it may all flare up and come to nothing any day
nobody can have any certainty with an expensive fellow like that said dr marjoribanks
there is no telling where he draws his income from it isn't from the land and it isn't from business and if it's money in the funds  dear papa said lucilla if he had the bank of england it would not make any difference to me
i am not going to swindle you after you have had the drawingroom done up and everything
i said ten years and i mean to keep to itif nothing very particular happens miss marjoribanks added prudently
most likely i shall begin to go off a little in ten years
and all i think of just now is to do my duty and be a little comfort to you
dr marjoribanks indulged in a faint humph
under his breath as he lighted his candle for as has been already said he was not a man to feel so keenly as some men might have felt the enthusiasm of filial devotion which beautified lucilla's life
but at the same time he had that respect for his daughter's genius which only experience could have impressed upon him and he did not venture or rather he did not think it necessary to enter into any further explanations
dr marjoribanks did not in the least degree share the nervousness of mr cavendish who was afraid of deceiving lucilla
as for her father he felt a consoling conviction that she was quite able to conduct her own affairs and would do him no discredit in any engagements she might form
and at the same time he was amused by the idea that he might be swindled in respect to the drawingroom if she married at this early moment
he took it for wit when it was the most solid and sensible reality but then fortunately the points in which he misapprehended her redounded as much to lucilla's credit as those in which he seized her meaning clearest so that on every side there was something to be gained
and when miss marjoribanks too retired to her maidenly chamber a sentiment of general content and satisfaction filled her mind
it is true that for the moment she had experienced a natural womanly vexation to see a proposal nipped in the bud
it annoyed her not so much on personal as on general principles for lucilla was aware that nothing could be more pernicious to a man than when thus brought to the very point to be thrown back again and never permitted to produce that delicate bloom of his affections
it was like preventing a rose from putting forth its flowers a cruelty equally prejudicial to the plant and to the world
but when this pang of wounded philanthropy was over miss marjoribanks felt in her heart that it was providence that had sent mrs chiley at that special moment
there was no telling what embarrassments what complications she might not have got into had mr cavendish succeeded in unbosoming himself
no doubt lucilla had a confidence that whatever difficulties there might have been she would have extricated herself from them with satisfaction and even clat but still it was better to avoid the necessity
thus it was with a serene conviction that whatever is is best that miss marjoribanks betook herself to her peaceful slumbers
there are so many people in the world who hold or are tempted to hold an entirely different opinion that it is pleasant to linger over the spectacle of a mind so perfectly well regulated
very different were the sentiments of mr cavendish who could not sleep for the ghosts that kept tugging at him on every side and those of barbara lake who felt that for her too the flower of her hero's love had been nipped in the bud
but to be sure it is only natural that goodness and selfcontrol should have the best of it sometimes even in this uncertain world
chapter xxii   the archdeacon returned to carlingford before thursday as he had anticipated but in the interval mr cavendish had not recovered his courage so far as to renew his visit to miss marjoribanks or to face the man who had alarmed him so much
everybody in grange lane remarked at the time how worried poor mrs woodburn looked
her eyes lost their brightness which some people thought was the only beauty she had and her nerves and her temper both failed her no one could tell why
the personal sketches she made at this moment were truculent and bitter to an unheardof degree
she took off mr beverley with a savage force which electrified her audience and put words into his mouth which everybody admitted were exactly like him if he could ever be imagined to have fallen into the extraordinary circumstances in which the mimic placed him
in short mrs woodburn made a little drama out of the archdeacon
mr beverley of course knew nothing about this and showed some surprise now and then at the restrained laughter which he heard in the corners but when anybody spoke of mrs woodburn he showed an instinctive want of confidence
i have not studied her sufficiently to give an opinion of her he said which was certainly the very reverse of her deliverance upon him
to tell the truth she had rather studied him too much and gave too keen an edge to his characteristic qualities as is natural to all literary portraiture and even went so far that in the end people began to ask whether she had any personal spite against him
she don't know him mr woodburn said when he heard some faint echo of this suggestion
she's clever and it carries her away you know
she enters into it so she don't know how far she is going but i can answer for it she never saw the archdeacon before and hal isn't here to give her the keynote as she says
he has met everybody i believe one place or another the simple man said with a little natural pride for in his heart he was vain of his fashionable brotherinlaw
as for mr cavendish himself it began to be understood that he was with a friend who was sick on the continent and soonfor news had a wonderful tendency to increase and grow bigger as it spread in grange lanethat his friend was dying and that a probable large increase of fortune to the popular favourite would be the result which was an idea that did credit to the imagination of carlingford
he had disappeared completely once more after the eventful day which we have described carrying out in the fullest way lucilla's prediction but striking barbara lake with bitter disappointment
miss marjoribanks had a great many things to occupy her but barbara had nothing except the humble duty of looking after her little brothers and sisters and attending to her father's comfort which had never been occupations particularly to her mind
and then barbara was aware that if she neglected her duties rose on her return from the school of design would do them though with a fierce little outbreak of indignation which the elder sister felt she could bear and accordingly she did little else but brood over his sudden disappearance and spend her time at the window looking for his return
lucilla conducted herself as might have been expected in a much more rational and dignified manner
she made herself very agreeable to the archdeacon who unbended very much and grew very nice as mrs chiley herself allowed
but my dear i am uneasy about his opinions the old lady said
he certainly had a very free way of talking and was ready to discuss anything and was not approved of by mr bury
but still he had very good connections and a nice position and had always a chance of being bishop of carlingford and in marriage it is well known that one never can have everything one wants
so that on the whole even mrs chiley did not see what difference his opinions made so far as lucilla was concerned
when miss marjoribanks went down to colonel chiley's in the evening and made tea for the old people like a daughter of the house mr beverley was always disposed to go over to the enemy as the old colonel said
no doubt he had enough of colonel chiley who had not received a new idea into his mind since the battle of waterloo and did not see what people had to do with such nonsense
and then the archdeacon would very often walk home with the young visitor
during this time as was natural mr beverley heard mr cavendish's name a hundred times and regretted like all the world that so eminent a member of the carlingford commonwealth should be absent during his visit but at the same time lucilla took great care to avoid all personalities and kept a discreet silence even about the gifts and accomplishments of her almostlover
mrs chiley sighed poor soul when she saw how her young friend avoided this subject and thought sometimes that he was forgotten sometimes that the poor dear was breaking her heart for him but it is needless to say that neither of these suppositions was in the least true
and then it began to be considered rather odd in carlingford that the archdeacon should pay such a long visit
mrs chiley no doubt was very kind and hospitable and exceedingly glad to receive such a distinguished clergyman but when a man has been six weeks in any one's house and shows no inclination of going it is natural that people should feel a little surprised
his visitation was over and he had dined with everybody and studied the place and its characteristics and entered into everything that was going on
the only thing indeed that he did not seem to think of was going away
if it had been mr cavendish the chances are that he would have made himself so much one of the family that his departure would have been felt as a domestic calamity but the archdeacon was very different from mr cavendish
so long as he was in the house it was impossible to forget either his position or his ways of thinking or the absence of any real connection between himself and his hosts
he did not combat or contradict anybody but he would give a faint smile when the colonel uttered his oldfashioned sentiments which drove the old soldier frantic
as if i was not able to form an opinion by jove
colonel chiley said while on the other hand the archdeacon was quite ready to enter into the young people's absurd theories and discuss the very bible itself as if that were a book to be discussed
as for the rector he turned his head away when he passed colonel chiley's door and miss bury made visits of condolence and sympathy
you must feel it a great responsibility having mr beverley with you the rector's sister would say though naturally without any distinct explanation of her meaning and then she would look at mrs chiley and sigh
oh i am sure it is a great pleasure mrs chiley answered not willing to let down the prestige of her guest
he is very nice and takes a great deal of interest in everything and then you know he is a connection of ours
the colonel's niece mary chiley  yes i know said miss bury
poor thing
she looked suffering the last time i saw her
i hope she has found the true consolation to support her now she has entered into the troubles of life
well yes i hope so said mrs chiley a little doubtfully but you know one does not feel the troubles of life very severely at her age and i don't think i should have called a baby a trouble when i was like her
i never had any you know and i used to fret over it a great deal but the colonel never liked the noise of children and i suppose it is all for the best
one may always be sure of that said miss bury in her instructive way
i suppose the archdeacon is going soon she added he has been here a long time now
i almost wonder he likes to be so long absent from his parish
two months is it not
oh nonot quite six weeks said mrs chiley briskly
i hope he may be persuaded to stay some time longer
i look upon it as quite a compliment to carlingford for to be sure he would not stay if he had not some attraction said the imprudent old woman
and this was precisely what miss bury wanted as any one of acute perceptions might have seen from the first
it must be a great responsibility for you said the rector's sister with a sigh pressing mrs chiley's hand
if it should turn out badly you knowof course my brother and i don't agree with mr beverley on all pointsthough i am sure i hope he is quite conscientious but i do feel for you with such a responsibility said miss bury with a look that made the old lady nervous in spite of herself
thus notwithstanding all her sense of the duties of hospitality and her anxiety about lucilla's interests she could not but feel that it would be rather a relief to get so formidable a guest fairly out of the house
it is uncomfortable it must be allowed to entertain in your house anybody particularly a clergyman of whom your rector does not approve and there could be no doubt that the archdeacon was not like the clergymen that mrs chiley had been accustomed to
and he could come back another time she said to herself by way of conciliating her own weariness with her visitor's advantage and the interests of lucilla
but notwithstanding these reflections on mrs chiley's part and notwithstanding the colonel's less amiable growl uttered every morningdoes that parson of yours never mean to go away
the archdeacon showed no intention of budging
it was poor mrs chiley who had all the brunt to bear to exhaust herself in civilities and to be upbraided with that parson of yourswhereas he was not in the least her parson nor even the kind of man she approved of as a clergyman
all this however the brave old woman bore with fortitude for lucilla's sake certainly it must be lucilla who kept him in carlingfordif it were not something else
things were in this condition mr cavendish having again disappeared into utter darkness and carlingford beginning to enter warmly into the question whether or not mr beverley was paying attention to lucilla when it happened to miss marjoribanks one morning to meet the archdeacon in a little lane running between grove street and grange lane
opening from this lane was a little door in the wall which admitted to a little garden very bright with flowers of the simplest oldfashioned kinds with a little house planted at its extremity which had pretensions to be an oldfashioned and quasirural cottage on the score of being very rickety uncomfortable and badly arranged
but it must be a very impracticable erection indeed which does not look tolerable under the bright sunshine on a summer noon at the end of a pretty garden where children are playing and birds singing and a woman or two about
lucilla was standing at the door of this little closedup hermitage almost filling up the opening with her crisp summer draperies and affording only a very partial and tempting glimpse of its flowers and shrubs and whitewashed walls inside and when mr beverley came up to miss marjoribanks he felt his curiosity excited
is it armida's garden or the elysian fields said the archdeacon and he made a dead stop before the door not knowing any more than any other blind mortal what he was going to find inside
i don't know anything about armida said miss marjoribanks unfortunately they were all cambridge in their ways of thinking at mount pleasant and our classics got dreadfully neglected
but you may come in if you likeat least i think you may come in if you will promise not to frighten the children
i am sure they never saw an archdeacon in their lives
are there children
said mr beverley with a doubtful air for to tell the truth he had come to the age at which men think it best to avoid children unless indeed they happen to have a personal interest in them and he stretched his neck a little to see in over miss marjoribanks's head
there are a whole lot of children and a pretty governess said lucilla
it is a school and i am so much interested in it
i may call it my school for that matter
i came to know her in the funniest way but i will tell you that another time
and it was just my luck as usual
she is so nice and quite a lady
if you will not say you are an archdeacon to frighten the children i will let you come in
you shall call me whatever you like said mr beverley when i am with the ladypatroness what does it matter what i call myself
let me see how you manage your educational department
i have already bowed before your genius in the other branches of government but this ought to be more in my own way
i don't think you care for visiting schools said lucilla
i know you think it is a bore but she is so nice and so nicelooking i am sure you will be pleased with her
i am quite sure she is a lady and has seen better days
oh those dreadful women that have seen better days
said the archdeacon i think mrs chiley has a regiment of them
it is hard to know how to get one's self into sympathy with those faded existences
they fill me with an infinite pity but then what can one do
if one tries to recall them to the past it sounds like mockeryand if one speaks of the present it wounds their feelings
it is a great social difficulty said mr beverley and he fixed his eyes on the ground and entered meditatively without looking where he was going in his broadchurch way
dear mrs chiley is so kind said lucilla who was a little puzzled for the moment and did not know what to say
mrs chiley is a good pure gentle woman said the archdeacon
he spoke in a tone which settled the question and from which there was no appeal and no doubt what he said was perfectly true though it was not a very distinct characterisation
thus they went in together into the bright little garden thinking of nothing in particular and loitering as people do who do not know what is coming
there was something that morning in mr beverley's tone and manner which struck lucilla as something more than usual
she was not a young woman to attach undue importance to looks and tones but the archdeacon's manner was so softened and mellowed and his eyes had so much expression in them and he looked at lucilla with such marked regard that it was impossible for her not to recognise that a crisis might be approaching
to be sure it was not by any means so near as that crisis manqu which had so lately passed over her head in respect to mr cavendish
but still miss marjoribanks could not but remark the signs of a slowly approaching and most likely more important climax and as she remarked it lucilla naturally by anticipation prepared herself for the coming event that thus threw a shadow upon her
she did not make up her mind to accept mr beverley any more than she had made up her mind to accept mr cavendish but she thought it only her duty to him and to herself and to society in general to take his claims into full consideration
and no doubt if these claims had seemed to her sufficiently strong to merit such a reward miss marjoribanks had it in her to marry the archdeacon and make him an admirable wife though she was not at the present moment so far as she was aware absolutely what foolish people call in love with him
at the same time she made herself all the more agreeable to mr beverley from her sense of the dawn of tenderness with which he regarded her
and in this way they went up the broad central path which traversed the little garden neither looking to the left nor the right but presenting all that appearance of being occupied with each other which especially to a female observer is so easy of interpretation
for to be sure the archdeacon had not the remotest idea into whose house he was going nor who it was whom he was about to see
but as it happened lucilla's protge who had seen better days had just finished one of her lessons and sent her little pupils out into the garden
she was preparing for the next little class when raising her eyes accidentally she saw miss marjoribanks coming through the garden with the archdeacon by her side
she was the same person whom mr bury had brought to lucilla with the idea of recommending her to dr marjoribanks as a companion and chaperone for his daughter but since then mrs mortimer's appearance had considerably changed
she had grown younger by ten years during the period of comparative comfort and tranquillity which lucilla's active help and championship had procured for her
her house and her garden and her little scholars and the bloom on her cheeks and the fillingup of her worn frame were all miss marjoribanks's doing
in the intervals of her legislative cares lucilla had run about all over carlingford searching for pupils and at the same moment had cut and stitched and arranged and papered walls and planted flowerbeds for the feeble creature thus thrown upon her
this was a side of lucilla's character which certainly she did nothing to hide from the public but which at the same time she never made any fuss about and it was an endless pleasure to her to find a protge so perfectly content to be done for and do as she was told to do
it was thus that the poor faded widow who was sensitive and had feelings and forgot herself so far as to faint or nearly to faint just at the most unlucky moment possible when the rector's character and dignity demanded superior selfcontrol on her part had found her youth again and her good looks under lucilla's shadow
when she looked up and saw the two approaching mrs mortimer's first impulse was to smile at the conjunction but the next moment she had dropped the books out of her hands and was standing gazing out like a woman in a dream with the colour all gone out of her cheeks and even out of her lips in the surprise of the moment
it was only surprise and a kind of dismay it was not terror like that which mr cavendish had exhibited at the same apparition
she dropped into her chair without knowing it and probably would have fainted this time also if something more urgent than mere feelings had not roused her up
as it was it happened very happily for her that she had thus a little preparation
when she saw that her patroness was leading mr beverley up to the door and that in a minute more he would inevitably be brought to her very side mrs mortimer roused up all her strength
she gathered up her books in her hand without knowing very well what she was doing and taking virtue from necessity went desperately out to meet them
it was miss marjoribanks who first saw her white and tottering leaning against the trellis of the little porch and lucilla could not but give a little cry of alarm and wonder
what kind of man could this be who thus struck down another victim without even so much as a glance
it was just then that the archdeacon raised his eyes and saw standing before him among the faded roses the woman whom he had been approaching so indifferentlythe faded existence that had seen better days
he saw her and he stood stockstill as if it was she who was the basilisk and the look of pleased interest went out of his face in a moment
in that moment he had become as unconscious of the presence of lucilla as if he had never in his life softened his voice to her ear or talked nonsense to please her
his eyes did not seem big enough to take in the figure which stood shrinking and looking at him in the porch
then he made one long step forward and took hold of her sleevenot her handas if to convince himself that it was something real he saw
he showed no joy nor satisfaction nor anything but sheer amaze and wonder at this unexpected appearance for he had not had time to prepare himself as she had
am i dreaming or is it you
he said in a voice that sounded as different from the voice with which he had been speaking to lucilla as if years had elapsed between the two
and it would be vain to describe the amazement and singular sense that the earth had suddenly given way under her feet with which miss marjoribanks stood by and looked on
chapter xxiii   miss marjoribanks was naturally the first to recover her senses in this emergency
even she selfpossessed as she was felt the natural giddiness inseparable from such a strange reversal of the position
but she did not lose her head like the others
she looked at the widow standing white and tremulous in the shadow of the little porch and on the archdeacon whose manly countenance had paled to a corresponding colour
a man does not seize a woman by the sleeve and ask is it you
without some reason for an address so destitute of ordinary courtesy and lucilla was sufficiently versed in such matters to know that so rude and startling an accost could be only addressed to some one whose presence set the speaker's heart beating and quickened the blood in his veins
it was odd to say the least after the way in which he had just been speaking to herself but miss marjoribanks as has been already said was not the woman to lose her head
she recovered herself with the second breath she drew and took her natural place
i can see that you have something to say to each other said lucilla
mrs mortimer ask mr beverley to walk in
never mind me
i want to speak to the little lakes
i shall come back presently miss marjoribanks added nodding pleasantly to the archdeaconand she went away to the other end of the garden calling to the children with that selfpossession which is the gift only of great minds
but when lucilla found herself at a safe distance and saw the archdeacon stoop to go in under the porch it cannot be denied that her mind was moved by the sight
it was she who had seen after the puttingup of that trellis round that porch and the arrangement of the wistaria which had been sprawling all over the front of the house uncared for
if there was any place in the world where she should have been free from such a shock it certainly should have been here in this spot which she had so to speak created
naturally the unfitness of these surroundings to witness a revolution so unlookedfor and disagreeable struck lucilla
if she had to be again humiliated and to submit once more to see another preferred to herself it certainly should have been under other circumstances
when we admit that such a thought did pass through the mind of miss marjoribanks it will prove to all who know her that lucilla found her position sufficiently aggravating
she had exerted herself for mrs mortimer as nobody else in carlingford would have exerted themselves
she had not only found pupils and a means of living for the widow which perhaps a committee of ladies might have done at the end of a year had it been put into their hands but miss marjoribanks had done it at once and had taken charge of that timid and maladroit individual herself and set her up and done everything for her
it was dr marjoribanks's gardener under lucilla's orders who had arranged and planted the garden and trained the embowering foliage which had just brushed the archdeacon's clerical hat as he went in and in the act of refurnishing her drawingroom miss marjoribanks had managed to procure without costing anybody anything except a little trouble as she herself said many accessories which gave an air of comfort to the little parlour in which no doubt at that moment mr beverley and mrs mortimer were explaining themselves
lucilla had a great deal too much good sense to upbraid anybody with ingratitude or even to make any claim upon that slippery quality but she knew at the same time that the widow was the very last person from whom a new discomfiture should come and that to enter in under that trellis when he left her was on the archdeacon's part an aggravation of the change in his sentiments which it was difficult to bear
she walked along the garden path very briskly under the influence of these thoughts and it was not in nature to do otherwise than snub the children when she joined them
lucilla was a woman of genius but she was not faultless and when she found ethelinda and ethelfreda lake the two twins the one with her clean frock all muddy and stained the other with the front breadth torn right up the middle it is scarcely to be wondered at if she lost her patience
you little nasty untidy things
she said i should like to know who you expect is to go mending up and washing every day for you
it will not be barbara i am sure miss marjoribanks added with a fine intonation of scorn of which the culprits were insensible and she gave ethelinda a shake who was sitting on the wet ground all muddy with recent watering and who besides was the one who most resembled barbara
when this temporary ebullition had taken place lucilla began gradually to right herself
it was a grand sight if anybody had been there to witness it or if anybody could have seen into miss marjoribanks's maiden bosom but the spectacle of a great mind thus recovering its balance is one which can rarely be visible except in its results
while she set the children to rights and represented to mrs mortimer's little servant who was in the garden furtively on a pretence of cabbages the extreme folly and indeed idiocy of letting them get to the water and make a mess of themselves lucilla was in reality coming to herself
perhaps she spoke with a little more energy than usual but the offenders were so well aware of their guilt and so thoroughly satisfied of the justice of the reproof addressed to them that no other explanation was necessary and little by little miss marjoribanks felt herself restored to her natural calm
you know i don't like to scold you she said but what would anybody saynice clean frocks that i am sure were put on fresh this morningand you mary jane  please miss it was only for a young cabbage
missis is fond of a bit of vegetable said the little maid
i knew she'd not say nothingand just as i had told 'em all to have done and be goodand nobody knew as you was here said mary jane
there was something even in that small and humble testimony to lucilla's sovereignty which helped on the process which was operating in her mind
she regained bit by bit that serene selfconsciousness which places the spirit above the passing vexations of the world
what did it matter what other people might be doing or saying
was not she still lucilla marjoribanks
and when one had said that one had said all
it is time you were all going home to your dinners said lucilla and i have asked mrs mortimer to give you a halfholiday
as for you you little linda you are not fit to be seen and i am sure if i were your sister i should send you off to bed
now get all your hats and things and run away and if you are not awfully good tomorrow i shall never ask for another halfholiday again
saying which miss marjoribanks herself saw the hats brought out and the little scholars sent away
she took matters into her own hand with the confidence of a superior nature
after all the long talk they are having she will not be able for her scholars today lucilla said magnanimously to herself and she again made the tour of the garden inspecting everything to see that all was in order
with every step that she took miss marjoribanks became more and more herself
as we have already said it was a grand and inspiring sight but then to be sure as in the former case her affections fortunately were not engaged
she was not in love with the archdeacon any more than she had been in love with mr cavendishthough it is true love is not everything
and to think how he had been looking and talking not much more than half an hour ago and to reflect that now he had most likely forgotten her very existence and was explaining himself and placing that position which would have just suited lucilla at the feet of the object of her bounty was enough to have driven a young woman of ordinary mind half out of her senses with disgust and indignation
but fortunately lucilla's mind was not an ordinary one and every step she took round the garden restored her more and more entirely to herself
instead of conceiving any jealous dislike to mrs mortimer she had already as has been stated exerted herself with her usual benevolence to leave the widow free for the rest of the day
after all it is not her fault if she knew him before or if he was in love with her lucilla said to herself
and when she had arrived at this perfectly true and profoundly philosophical conclusion it may be said that the crisis was at an end
but then where personal offence and indignation if the natural shock to miss marjoribanks's feelings could be called by such hard names ended bewilderment and curiosity began
who could this archdeacon be who had frightened the most popular man in carlingford out of the place and whose unlookedfor appearance had driven mrs mortimer back out of her recovered good looks and cheerfulness into pallor and trembling
it is true that lucilla knew quite well who he wasthe second son of mr beverley of trent valley a family as well known as any family in england
everybody knew all about the archdeacon his career from his youth up was as clearly traceable as if he had been killed in a railway accident and had had his memoir published in the times
there was nothing in the smallest degree secret or mysterious about him and yet how could it come about that the sight of him should frighten mr cavendish out of his senses and make mrs mortimer who was utterly unconnected with mr cavendish all but faint as she had done on a former occasion
was it his mission to go about the world driving people into fits of terror or agitation
to be sure he was a broadchurchman and not the type of clergyman to which lucilla in her heart inclined but still a man may be broad church and speak a little freely on religious matters without being a basilisk
as these thoughts went through her mind miss marjoribanks could not help observing that the branches of the peartree which was all that the garden contained in the shape of fruit had come loose from the wall and were swaying about greatly to the damage of the halfgrown pearsnot to say that it gave a very untidy look to that corner
i must send crawford down this evening to fasten it up lucilla said to herself and then went on with what she was thinking and she made one or two other remarks of the same description in a parenthesis as she made her tour
after all it is astonishing how many little things go wrong when the man or woman with a hundred eyes is absent for a few days from the helm of affairs
it was nearly a week since miss marjoribanks had been round mrs mortimer's garden and in that time the espalier had got detached some of the verbenas were dead in the borders and the half of the sticks that propped up the dahlias had fallen leaving the plants in miserable confusion
lucilla shook her head over this as she asked herself what mysterious influence there could be in the archdeacon
for her own part she was not in the slightest degree afraid of him nor could she confess to having felt agitated even when he walked with her into this fated garden but there could be no doubt of the seriousness of the effect produced by his appearance on the two others
they have broken half of the props the little nuisances lucilla said to herself as she pursued her musings
for her large mind was incapable now that its perfect serenity was happily regained of confining itself unless with a very good reason to one sole subject
when she had finished her inspection and saw that nobody had yet appeared at the door miss marjoribanks collected the books which the children had left lying in the summerhouse and put them under coverfor to tell the truth it looked a little like rain and having done this and looked all round her to see if anything else required her immediate care lucilla carried philosophy to its highest practical point by going away which is perhaps a height of good sense which may be thought too much for humanity
it was not too much for miss marjoribanks's legislative soul and knowledge of human natureand in thus denying herself she was perfectly aware of her advantages and of the inevitable result
she knew just as well as if she had already received it that mrs mortimer would write her a little threecornered note marked private as soon as the archdeacon was gone and she thought it was highly probable that mr beverley himself would come to give some explanation
with this tranquil assurance in her mind lucilla turned her face towards grange lane
she began to have a kind of conviction too since this had happened either that carlingford would not be raised into a bishopric or that the archdeacon at least would not be the first bishop
it was difficult to give any ground for the idea but it came into her mind with a kind of quiet certainty and with this conviction in which she recognised that beautiful selfadjusting balance of compensations which keeps everything right in the world lucilla quite recovered from her shock had on the whole a pleasant walk home
as for the two who were shut up together in mrs mortimer's parlour their state of mind was far from partaking of the virtuous peace and serenity which filled miss marjoribanks's bosom
it was more than an hour before the archdeacon went away and when mrs mortimer had a little collected her faculties the result arrived which had been foreseen by lucilla
in the first place terror seized the widow as to what had become of her pupils whom all this time she had forgotten and deep was her gratitude when she had ascertained that her protecting genius had sent them away
but with that gratitude came a sudden recollection of the manner in which mr beverley and miss marjoribanks had been coming together up the garden path before the mistress of the house showed herself
mrs mortimer wrung her hands when she recollected the looks and attitude of the two and the rumour which had reached her ears that the archdeacon was paying attention to miss marjoribanks
what was she to dowas her miserable presence here to dispel perhaps the youthful hopes of her benefactress and make a revolution in lucilla's prospects
the poor woman felt herself ready to sink into the earth at the thought
she went to the window and looked out disconsolately into the rainfor it had come on to rain as lucilla supposed it wouldand felt like a creature in a cage helpless imprisoned miserable not knowing what to do with herself and the cause of trouble to her best friends
a little house in a garden may look like a little paradise in the sunshine and yet feel like a dungeon when a poor woman all alone looks out across her flowers in the rain and sees nothing but the wall that shuts her in and thinks to herself that she has no refuge nor escape from itnobody to tell her what to do nothing but her own feeble powers to support her and the dreadful idea that she has done harm and can do no good to her only protector
any reasonable creature would have said that to be there in her own house poor enough certainly but secure and no longer driven lonely and distressed about the world was a great matter
but yet after all the walls that shut her in the blast of white sweeping downright rain which seemed to cut her off from any succour outside and the burden of something on her mind which by herself she was quite unable to bear was a hard combination and wringing one's hands and feeling one's mind ready to give way under a new and unexpected burden could not advance matters in the slightest degree
she was not strongminded as has been already proved nor indeed had she the ordinary amount of indifference to other people or confidence in herself which stands in the place of selfcontrol with many people
after she had wrung her hands and looked out again and again with a vague instinct of perhaps finding some suggestion of comfort outside mrs mortimer relapsed by necessity into the one idea that had been a support to her for so many months past
all that she could do was to consult lucillait might be to wound lucilla for anything she could tell but when a poor creature is helpless and weak and has but one friend in the world who is strong what can she do but apply to her sustainer and guardian
when after beating about wildly from one point to another she arrived ultimately as might have been predicted and as miss marjoribanks had expected from the first at that conclusion there remained a further difficulty in respect to the means of communication
lucilla had settled quite calmly in her own mind that it would be by the medium of a threecornered note a matter in which there was no difficulty whatever for the widow was sufficiently fluent with her pen but then lucilla had not thought of mary jane who was the only possible messenger
it was to this point now that mrs mortimer's ideas addressed themselves
at that moment the rain poured down fiercer than ever the bricks of the uncovered wall grew black with the wet and the wistaria crouched and shivered about the porch as if it wanted to be taken indoors
and then to get wet and perhaps catch cold was a thing mary jane conscientiously avoided like the rest of the world and it was with a sense of alarm even stronger than that excited by the possibility of injuring lucilla that mrs mortimer very gently and modestly rang her bell
i don't think it rains quite so heavily said the timid experimentalist feeling her heart beat as she made this doubtful statement
have you a pair of goloshes mary jane
no said the little handmaiden with precaution and please if it's for the post it rains worse nor ever and i don't think as mother would like  oh it is not for the post said mrs mortimer it is for miss marjoribanks
you can take mine and then you will not get your feet wet
i go out so very little you may have themto keepmary jane
and you can take the big shawl that hangs in the passage and an umbrella
i don't think it is so heavy as it was
mary jane regarded the rain gloomily from the window but her reluctance was at an end from the moment she heard that it was to miss marjoribanks she was going
to be sure the distance between the serenissime nancy and thomas and the other inmates of the doctor's kitchen and mrs mortimer's little handmaiden was as great as that which exists between an english duke and the poorest little cadet of a large family among his attendant gentry but correspondingly the merest entrance into that higher world was as great a privilege for mary jane as the duke's notice would be to the squire's youngest son
she kept up a momentary show of resistance but she accepted the goloshes and even after a moment agreed in her mistress's trembling assertion about the rain
and this was how the threecornered note got conveyed to its destination in the heaviest of the storm between three and four o'clock in the afternoon
mrs mortimer still sat at her window wringing her hands from time to time with her head aching and her heart beating and a dreadful question in her mind as to what lucilla would say or whether perhaps she might reject altogether in her natural indignation the appeal made to her which was an idea which filled the widow with inexpressible horror
while at the same moment miss marjoribanks sat looking for that appeal which she knew was sure to come
the rain had set in by this time with an evident intention of lasting and even from the windows of lucilla's drawingroom the prospect of the garden walls and glistening trees was sufficiently doleful
nobody was likely to call nothing was doing and lucilla who never caught cold had not the least fear of wetting her feet
and besides her curiosity had been rising every moment since her return and the widow's pathetic appeal come to me my dearest lucilla
i have nobody whom i can talk to in the world but you
had its natural effect upon a mind so feeling
miss marjoribanks got up as soon as she had read the note and changed her dress and put on a great waterproof cloak
instead of thinking it a trouble she was rather exhilarated by the necessity
be sure you make your mistress a nice cup of tea as soon as we get there she said to mary jane
she must want it i am sure if she has not had any dinner for the little maid had betrayed the fact that mrs mortimer could not eat anything and had sent away her dinner which was naturally an alarming and wonderful occurrence to mary jane
the widow was still sitting at the window when lucilla appeared tripping across the wet garden in her waterproof cloak if not a ministering angel at least a substantial prop and support to the lonely woman who trusted in her and yet in the present instance feared her
but anything more unlike a disappointed maiden whose wooer had been taken away from her under her very eyes could not have been seen
on the contrary miss marjoribanks was radiant with raindrops glistening on her hair and what mrs chiley called a lovely colour
if there was one thing in the world more than another which contented lucilla it was to be appealed to and called upon for active service
it did her heart good to take the management of incapable people and arrange all their affairs for them and solve all their difficulties
such an office was more in her way than all the archdeacons in the world
i saw you knew him the moment i looked at you said lucilla
i have seen other people look like that when he appeared
who is he for goodness' sake
i know quite well of course who he is in the ordinary way but do tell me what has he done to make people look like that whenever he appears
mrs mortimer did not directly answer this questionshe fixed her mind upon one part of it like an unreasonable woman and repeated other people
with a kind of interrogative gasp
oh it was only a gentleman said lucilla with rapid intelligence and then there was a little pause
he has been here for six weeks miss marjoribanks continued you must have heard of him indeed you would have heard him preach if you had not gone off after these dissenters
did you really never know that he was here till today
i did not think of him being archdeaconhe was only a curate when i used to know him said poor mrs mortimer with a sigh
tell me all about it said lucilla with ingenuous sympathy and she drew her chair close to that of her friend and took her hand in a protecting encouraging way
you know whatever you like to say that it is quite safe with me
if you are sure you do not mind said the poor widow
oh yes i have heard what people have been saying about him andand you lucilla and if i had known i would have shut myself upi would have gone away for ever and everi would  my dear said miss marjoribanks with a little severity i thought you knew me better
if i had been thinking of that sort of thing i never need have come home at all and when you know how kind papa has been about the drawingroom and everything
say what you were going to say and never think of me
ah lucilla i have had my life said the trembling woman whose agitation was coming to a climaxi have had it and done with it and you have been so good to me and if after all i was to stand between you andandandanybody but here mrs mortimer broke down and could say no more
to be sure she did not faint this time any more than she did on the first occasion when she made miss marjoribanks's acquaintance but lucilla thought it best as then to make her lie down on the sofa and keep her quite quiet and hasten mary jane with the cup of tea
you have been agitated and you have not eaten anything said lucilla
i am going to stay with you till halfpast six when i must run home for dinner so we have plenty of time and as for your life i don't consider you gone off at all yet and you are a great deal youngerlooking than you were six months ago
i am very glad the archdeacon did not come until you had got back your looks
it makes such a difference to a man miss marjoribanks added with that almost imperceptible tone of contempt which she was sometimes known to use when speaking of their absurd peculiarities
as for mrs mortimer the inference conveyed by these words brought the colour to her pale cheeks
it will never come to that she said no more than it did in old days it never can lucilla and i don't know that it is to be wished
i couldn't help being put out a little when i saw him you know but there is one thing that he never never will persuade me said the widow
lucilla could not but look on in surprise and even consternation while mrs mortimer thus expressed herself
a warm flush animated the pale and somewhat worn faceand a gleam of something that looked absolutely like resolution shone in the yielding woman's mild eyes
was it possible that even she had one point upon which she could be firm
miss marjoribanks stood still petrified in the very act of pouring out the tea
if it is only one thing if i were you i would give in to him said lucilla with a vague sense that this sort of selfassertion must be put a stop to mingling with her surprise
never said mrs mortimer again with a still more distinct gleam of resolution
in the first place i have no right whatever to anything more than my uncle gave me
he told me himself i was to have no more and he was very very kind to poor edward
you don't know all the circumstances or you would not say so she cried with a sob
as for miss marjoribanks if it is possible to imagine her clear spirit altogether lost in bewilderment it would have been at that moment but she recovered as soon as she had administered her cup of tea
now tell me all about it said lucilla again sitting down by the sofa and this time mrs mortimer to whom her excitement had given a little spur and stimulus did not waste any more time
he is my cousin she said not my real cousin but distant and i will not deny that long long agowhen we were both quite young you know lucilla  yes yes i understand said miss marjoribanks pressing her hand
he was very nice in those days said mrs mortimer faltering that is i don't mean to say he was not always nice you know but onlyi never had either father or mother
i was living with my uncle garrettmy uncle on the other side and he thought he should have made me his heiress but instead of that he left his money you know to him and then he was dreadfully put out and wanted me to go to law with him and change the will but i never blamed him for my part lucillahe knows i never blamed himand nothing he said would make me give in to go to the law with him  stop a minute said lucilla i am not quite sure that i understand
who was it he wanted you to go to law with
and was it to the archdeacon the money was left
oh lucilla said the widow with momentary exasperation you who are so quick and pick up everything to think you should not understand me when i speak of a thing so important
of course it was not to charles beverley the money was left if it had been left to him how could he have wanted me to go to law
it has always been the question between us said mrs mortimer once more lighting up with exceptional and unwonted energy
he said i was to indict him for conspiracy and i declare to you lucilla that he was not to blame
uncle garrett might be foolish but i don't say even that he was foolish he was so good to him like a son and he had no son of his own and i was only a girl
he never was anything to me said mrs mortimer wiping her eyesnever whatever charles may choose to say but if ever i was sure of anything in the world i am sure that he was not to blame
lucilla's head began to whirl but after her first unsuccessful essay she was wise enough not to ask any more direct questions
she made all the efforts possible with ears and eyes intent to disentangle this web of pronouns and failing waited on in the hope that time and patience would throw a little light upon them
i suppose mr beverley thought he was to blame
she said when the narrator paused to take breath
is not that what i am saying
said mrs mortimer
it was through that it was all broke off
i am sure i don't know whether he has regretted it or not lucilla
it is not always very easy to understand a gentleman you know
after i was married to poor edward naturally i never had any more correspondence with him and to see him today without any warning and to find him just as bent as he was upon making me prosecute and just as full of bad feeling and speaking as if there was some reason more than truth and justice why i should be so determined
no lucilla said mrs mortimer raising herself up on the sofa it is just the same thing as ever and the same obstacle as ever and it never will come to that
you are agitating yourself said miss marjoribanks lie downthere's a dearand keep quite still and see whether we cannot make anything better of it
tell me what would you go to law with him for
lucilla continued with the natural humility of imperfect comprehension
it was perhaps the first time in her life that such a singular chance had happened to miss marjoribanks as to have a matter explained to her and yet be unable to understand
he says he could be indicted for conspiracy or for having too much influence over him and making him do what he liked
but he was very good to him lucilla and to my poor edward and when i was married to him  goodness gracious
were you married to him as well
cried lucilla fairly losing the thread and her balance in this confusing circle
mrs mortimer grew pale and rose quite up from the sofa and went with the air of an insulted woman to seat herself in her usual chair
i don't know why you should address me so she said
he is nothing to me and never was
it is an insult to me to think that i must have a personal reason for refusing to do a wicked and unjust thing
i could give up anything said the widow losing a little of her dignity and growing again pathetici would give in in a moment if it was any fancy of mineyou know i would but i am sure it would be wicked and unjust  i am sure i am not the person to bid you do anything unjust or wicked said lucilla who in the utter confusion of her faculties began to feel offended in her turn
then i beg you will never speak to me of it again
cried mrs mortimer
how is it possible that either he or you can know the rights of it as i do who was in the house at the time and saw everything
he may say what he likes but i know there was no conspiracy he was just as much surprised as you could be or charles or anybody
of course it was for his advantagenobody denies thatbut you don't mean to say that a man is to reject everything that is for his advantage
said the widow turning eyes of indignant inquiry upon her visitor and miss marjoribanks for once was so utterly perplexed that she did not know how to respond
but you said when you were married to him
said lucilla who felt that the tables were turned upon her for the moment
i am sure i beg your pardon for being so stupid but whom were you married to
this was said in the most deprecating tone in the world but still it irritated mrs mortimer whose mind was all unhinged and who somehow felt that she was not finding in miss marjoribanks the help and support to which her clear and detailed explanation entitled her
though her head was aching dreadfully she sat up more upright than ever in her chair
i don't think you can mean to insult me miss marjoribanks said the widow after being so kind
perhaps i have been trying you too much by what i have said though i am sure i would have given up everything and gone away anywhere rather than be the cause of anything unpleasant
you know that it was my poor dear edward i was married to you know i have aa horror said mrs mortimer faltering in generalof second marriages
oh yes said lucilla but there are always exceptions you know and when people have no children nor anythingand you that were so young
i always make exceptions for my part and if you could only get over this one point miss marjoribanks added making a dexterous strategical movement
but mrs mortimer only shook her head
i don't think i am hard to get on with she said but my poor edward always said one must make a stand somewhere
he used to say i was so easy to be persuaded
he was glad to see i had a point to make a stand on instead of being disagreeable about it or thinking he was anything to me
and oh lucilla he was so kind to him said the widow with tears in her eyes
we met him quite by chance and he was so kind
i will never forget it if i should live a hundred years
and why should charles be in such a way
he never did him any harm
if any one was injured it was me and i never felt myself injuredneither did edward
on the contrary he always did him justice lucilla mrs mortimer continued fixing a pathetic look upon her friend
what could lucilla do
she was burning to take it all in her own hands and arrange it somehow and unite the two lovers who had been so long separated but unless she could understand what the point was on which mrs mortimer made her stand what could she do
i never could understand said the widow who began to feel her heart sick with the disappointment of that hope which she had fixed in miss marjoribanks why he should take it so much to heart
poor edward never thought of such a thing
and why he should be so set against poor mr kavan and solucilla
oh tell me do you see anything
what do you mean
i want to know who mr kavan is
said miss marjoribanks much startled
she had for the moment forgotten the archdeacon's discovery and her own suspicions and the idea of connecting the man who had apparently fled from mr beverley's presence with the innocent and helpless woman upon whom the appearance of the broad churchman had so overwhelming an effect had never hitherto entered her imagination
but this name which was not the name of anybody she knew and yet seemed to bear an odd sort of rudimentary relationship to another name struck her like a sudden blow and brought everything back to her mind
it was a bewildering sort of explanation if it was an explanation but still a confused light began to break upon lucilla's understanding
if this was what it all meant then there was the widest opening for charitable exertions and much to be done which only a mind like miss marjoribanks's could do
that is not his name now said mrs mortimer i don't see if he liked it why he should not change his name
i am sure a great many people do but his name was kavan when he lived with my uncle
i don't remember what it was after for of course he was always mr kavan to me and charles beverley never could bear him
he used to thinkbut oh lucilla forgive meoh forgive me if it is too much for you
she added a moment after as another idea struck her
it was not with the idea ofof anything coming of it you know it will never come to thatnot nowi don't know if it is to be wished
i am sure he is quite free so far as i am concerned
it was not with that idea i asked for your advice lucilla said the poor woman in piteous tones
if miss marjoribanks had pressed her and insisted upon knowing what was the idea which had moved her friend to ask her advice mrs mortimer would no doubt have found it very hard to reply but lucilla had no such cruel intentions and the widow notwithstanding her piteous denial of any motive now that her mind was cleared and she had caught the comprehension of her auditor began to regard her with a certain instinct of hope
as for miss marjoribanks this revelation at once troubled and cleared her mind
if this was the culprit he was a culprit and yet he was innocent and to heap coals of fire upon his head was in some respects a christian duty
her ideas went forward at a bound to a grand finale of reconciliation and universal brotherhood
she saw the tools under her hands and her very fingers itched to begin
large and varied as her experience was she had never yet had any piece of social business on so important a scale to manage and her eyes sparkled and her heart beat at the idea
instead of shrinking from interference her spirits rose at the thought
to vanquish the archdeacon to pluck out from the darkness and rehabilitate and set at his ease the mysterious adventurer whom to be sure she could not say she knewfor lucilla was very careful even in her own thoughts not to commit herself on this subjectand to finish off by a glorious and triumphant marriagenot her own it is true but of her making which was more to the purposesuch was the programme she made out for herself with the speed of lightning the moment she had laid hold of the clue which guided or seemed to guide her through the labyrinth
it would be too lengthy a matter to go into all her tender cares for the widow's comfort during the rest of her stay and the pains and delicacy with which she managed to elicit further particulars and to make out her brief so to speak while she cheered up and encouraged the witness
miss marjoribanks jumped to the conclusion that poor edward had been after all but a temporary tenant of the heart which was now again free for the reception of the archdeacon if he could be got to accept the conditions
when halfpast six arrived and thomas came for her with the great umbrella she went off quite resplendent in her waterproof cloak and utterly indifferent to the rain leaving mrs mortimer worn out but with a glimmer of hope in her mind
such was the great work which without a moment's hesitation lucilla took upon her shoulders
she had no more fear of the result than she had of wetting her feet which was a thing mrs mortimer and thomas were both concerned about
but then lucilla knew her own resources and what she was capable of and proceeded upon her way with that unconscious calm of genius which is always so inexplicable to the ordinary world
chapter xxiv   it was the most unlucky moment for the weather to change being the middle of july and as near as possible to st swithin's day but the season had been so delightful up to that time that nobody in carlingford at least had any reason to complain
so far as miss marjoribanks was concerned she was rather glad on the whole that the next day was wet and that she could not go out all the morning nor was likely to be interrupted by visitors
she had all her plans to settle and mature for the great enterprise which she had taken in hand
by this time so far from feeling any personal interest in the archdeacon or considering herself injured by his sudden desertion that little episode had gone out of lucilla's mind as completely as if it had never been
in one point however miss marjoribanks's conviction remained firm it was impressed upon her mind that carlingford would not be made into a bishopric or if made into a bishopric that it was not mr beverley who would be chosen to occupy the new see
it was one of those instinctive certainties which are not capable of explanation which was thus borne in upon her spirit and she could not have felt more sure of it had she seen it under the queen's own hand and seal
while she went about her usual morning occupations her mind was full of her great and novel undertaking
mr beverley was not a man to be revolutionised in a moment and many people would have shrunk from the attempt to work in a few days or weeks with no better arms than those of acquaintance a change which the influence of love had not been able to do in so many years
but it was not in lucilla's nature to be daunted by a difficulty so unimportant
there was thank heaven some difference between herself and the widow who in a strait could think of nothing better to do poor soul
than to faint and miss marjoribanks had the advantage of never as yet having been beaten whereas mrs mortimer had undergone numberless defeats
the hardest matter in the whole business however was the identification of the mr kavan whom the archdeacon thought he had seen in carlingford and was not afraid to speak of as a clever rascal and adventurer
mr beverley had never seen the fellow again as he had told lucilla not many days back and miss marjoribanks had been unfeignedly glad to hear it but now matters had changed
in the course of her reflections she decided that it would now be best that these two men if possible should meet and recognise each other and that the business should once for all be definitively settled
if all the offence he had committed against society was to have had a large sum of money left him by a childless old man lucilla saw no reason why this mysterious culprit should conceal himself and even if he had taken a little liberty with his name that was not a crimehis name was his own surely if anything was his own
at the same time miss marjoribanks took pains to impress upon herself as it is to be hoped a friendly audience will also have the goodness to do that she had no real foundation for her suspicions as to the identity of this personage and might turn out to be completely mistaken
he might have made no change whatever on his name he might be flourishing in some other quarter of england or the world with all his antecedents perfectly well known and unconscious of anything to be ashamed about which to tell the truth was as lucilla confessed to herself a much more likely hypothesis than the supposition which had taken such possession of her mind
but then miss marjoribanks had a just faith in her instincts and in those brief but telling pieces of evidence which supported her conclusion
she was thinking over this important branch of the subject with the greatest care and devotion when looking out by chance into the rain she saw the archdeacon crossing the garden
perhaps it was just as well that she thus had warning and a moment to prepare for his visit not that lucilla was a person to be taken at disadvantage but still in a matter so practical and pressing it was always better to be prepared
mr beverley came in with an air and expression so different from that which he had borne in their intercourse no further gone than yesterday that notwithstanding the corresponding revolution in her own mind miss marjoribanks could not but regard him with mingled admiration and surprise
she judged him as the general world so often judged herself and gave him credit for skill and courage in assuming such an attitude when the fact was he was only preoccupied and natural and did not think of his attitude at all
it did not occur to the archdeacon that he had sinned towards lucilla
he thought it right to explain to her his extreme surprise at the sight of mrs mortimer and possibly to make her aware at the same time of his grievances in so far as mrs mortimer was concerned but perhaps mr beverley was on the whole innocent of those intentions which mrs chiley had attributed to him and which even lucilla more clearsighted had seen dawning in their last interview for to be sure this is one of the questions which the female intellect is apt to judge in a different light from that in which it is regarded by a man
the archdeacon accordingly came in preoccupied with a cloud on his brow but without the smallest appearance of penitence or deprecation by which demeanour he gained without deserving it the respect and to a certain extent the admiration of lucilla
his expression was not that of a man repentant but of a man aggrieved
he had a cloud upon his countenance and a certain air of offence and temper and when he sat down he breathed a short impatient sigh
thank you for receiving me so early he said
i called yesterday afternoon but found you out
you must have had very particular business to take you out in that rain mr beverley continued with subdued exasperation for naturally being a clergyman he was a little impatient to find when it was he who wanted her any of his female friends out of the way
yes said lucilla who thought it was best to open her battery boldly and at once
i was spending the afternoon with poor mrs mortimer poor dear she is so solitary
and to meet mr beverley's illtemper miss marjoribanks put on her most heavenly air of sympathy and rounded her words with a soft sigh as different from his as a flute is from a trumpet
it was with an exclamation of impatience that the archdeacon replied
poor mrs mortimer
he cried i don't know whether you are aware how much her obstinacy has cost me and herself i suppose he added in a parenthesis
not to depreciate your kindness or the truly human and christian way in which you have conducted yourselffancy what my feelings naturally must have been to find her an object of charityactually of charity
i don't mean to say said mr beverley controlling himself that it is degrading to accept succour when given as from man to manquite the contrary but you will excuse me from entering into the general question
she knew perfectly well that if i had known where she wasif she had consented to yield to me on one pointsolely on one point  and she such an obstinate woman
said miss marjoribanks with fine scorn
how could you ever think of such a thing
a woman that never gives in to anybody
if you knew her as well as i do  the archdeacon glanced up with a momentary intense surprise as if it was within the possibilities that such a change might have taken place in the widow's nature and then he caught lucilla's eye and grew red and more aggrieved than ever
mrs mortimer happens to be a relative of mine he said in his authoritative voice
i have known her from her youth
i am better instructed in all her affairs than she can possibly be
when i urge her to any step however much it may be against her inclinations she ought to know that it can only be for her good
i beg your pardon miss marjoribanks
it will give me great grief to find that you upon whose superior good sense i have so much calculated should support her in her folly
i know how much she owes to you  oh no she does not owe me anything said lucilla
it was just my luck you know
i knew she would turn out to be a lady
i don't want to stand up for her if she is wrong but i have only heard her side
when you tell me about it i shall be able to form an opinion miss marjoribanks added prudently for of course everything has two sides
most things said mr beverley but this is precisely one of the things which have not two sides
nothing except some sort of infatuation or otherbut never mind you shall hear the facts said the archdeacon once more making an effort upon himself
her uncle mr garrett was above eighty
why providence should have let him live to such an age to do so much mischief heaven alone knows
some different rule seems to exist up there about those matters from what we find to answer on earth the broadchurchman said with a certain air of disapproval
he had this young fellow to see him and then to live with him and took some sort of idiotic fancy to him and when the will was made it was found that with the exception of a small sum to helen everything was left to this impostor
no i can't say i have any patience with her folly
how could any man have two opinions on the subject
he was neither related to him nor connected with him cried mr beverley with a momentary inclination as lucilla thought to get aground among the pronouns as mrs mortimer had done
i do not suspect my cousin the archdeacon continued with an air so severe and indignant that it was evident he was contradicting his own sentiments of having any partiality for such a person but certainly her obstinacy and determination are such  hush please said lucilla you are only laughing when you use such words
now tell me one thing and don't be angry if it is a stupid questionif there was any one that knew her and you and perhaps him and was to trydon't you think it might be arranged
by money
said the archdeacon and he smiled one of those disagreeable smiles which youthful writers describe by saying that his lip curled with scorn
you seem to take me for mortimer who could go into that sort of compromise
i suppose he did give them money beforebefore she was left a widow said mr beverley grinding his teeth slightly with a savage expression
no miss marjoribanks
where everlasting truth and justice are concerned i do not understand how things can be arranged
after such a truculent statement what was the peacemaker to do
she left the fire to blaze out by itself for a minute or two and then she came down upon the enemy on another wind
i am sure i am very sorry said lucilla softly to think you should be so fond of her and she so fond of you and nothing but this standing in the way and then she is too good for this world and never thinks of herself
i often think if anything was to happen to meand my life is no safer than other people's lives said miss marjoribanks with a sighwhat would become of her poor dear
i am sure if i knew of any wayas for obstinate you know it is not in her to be obstinate
she thinks she is right and you think you are right and i suppose neither of you will give in cried lucilla
what is anybody to do
if any one gives in it should be she said the archdeacon
for my part i will never stand by and consent to such a robberynever
in these matters at least a man must be a better judge than a woman
if you are her friend you will persuade her of her duty mr beverley added and he did not show so much as a symptom of yielding
to say that miss marjoribanks was not discouraged would be more than the truth but she was still at the beginning of her forces and no thought of giving in was in her courageous soul
i will tell you what occurs to me said lucilla frankly
let us find out something about him
do you know anything about him
if she were to hear that he was as you say an impostor you know and a villainwhat is his namewhere does he liveis he a very very wicked man
said miss marjoribanks and she looked up with that ingenuous look of appeal which was always so touching in her to the archdeacon's face
as for mr beverley in his haste and excitement he gave vent to two very contradictory statements
she knows all about him
i don't know anything about him he said with some heat
i mean she knows as much as i do though she draws such a different conclusion
i am sure i saw him in carlingford the first day i was here
for anything i can tell she knows more of him than i do said the broad churchman with a sudden flash of jealousy and anger
it occurred to lucilla then for the first time that she had found the grand clue to the whole
that would be dreadful said miss marjoribanks if she knew him and was keeping him out of the way till you were gone
i did not think of that
if such a thing should be the case fond as i am of mrs mortimer i never could go near her any more said lucilla sadly
oh don't say you think so please
i should have to give her up and that would be dreadful for i owe it to papa when he gives me so much liberty to be very careful
oh mr beverley don't say you think so cried lucilla deeply moved
she put her handkerchief to her eyes and yet she kept watch upon the archdeacon through one of the corners
he had got up by this time and was walking about the room like any other man in trouble
to throw suspicion on the widow or separate her from so effectual a protector was the very last thing he had any inclination to do for to tell the truth he made that jealous suggestion only in order to receive an indignant denial and to be assured that such a thing was impossible
but then mr beverley did not know whom he had to deal with nor that he was not the first man whom miss marjoribanks had reduced to his proper place
if that was the case said lucilla drying her eyes dreadful as it is to think of itoh mr beverley if such a thing were the caseit would be far better for her to marry him and then she would have all the fortune without going to law
if things have gone so far though it is miserable to think of it and to believe that she could be so unkind said miss marjoribanks with a sob and so doubleminded and so deceitful to me  in heaven's name what are you thinking of
said the archdeacon
he had grown as pale as he was before red and came to a dead stop in front of lucilla and stood lowering and menacing over her
his shadow was so big and strong and stood so directly between her and the window that miss marjoribanks's heart gave one bound of something like alarm
dear mr beverley said lucilla try and compose yourself
it would be a dreadful trial to me but i should endeavour to bear it
if we love her we should on the contrary urge her to do it said the young moralist with solemnity however hard it may be to us
it would be better thanthan dreadful concealment and miseryit would be better than knowing and not telling as you say
oh mr beverley if you are sure that is the case let us both go to her and beg her to marry him
i could never never never see her again sobbed lucilla but she would be happy and that would be the end of all
the archdeacon though he was not a weakling was altogether stunned by this address
he sank into the nearest chair and drew it closer to lucilla and looked perfectly flabby and ghastly in his white tie with his alarmed countenance
for the sake of all that is sacred said mr beverley bending forward towards her tell me what foundation you havetell me all you know
now was the critical moment and lucilla felt it
if mrs chiley for example had only advised herself to come in then instead of interrupting people's proposals and driving a likely suitor to desperation
but such happy chances do not occur at the real crises of life
what she wanted was naturally not to explain herself but to let that arrow rankle in her opponent's heart until it should have served her purpose
all that she said in answer to mr beverley's appeal was to hide her face in her handkerchief which was the only means that occurred to her for the moment of gaining a little time for reflection
it is so hard to have such thoughts put into one's head said lucilla of a person who has been one's friend
and she always looked so nice and so true
i never thought she would deceive any one
i thought she was so transparent you know
oh mr beverley it is so dreadful to be disappointed in one's friends
i wish i had never heard of iti wish you had never told me
i almost wish though it is dreadful to say such a thing that you had never come to carlingford and found it all out
my dear miss marjoribanks said the archdeacon solemnly i implore you as the greatest kindness you can do me to tell me all you know
indeed i don't know what i know said lucilla partially raising her face out of her handkerchief i don't think i know anything for my part
i always thought if one could rely upon any one one could rely upon herfor truthfulness and for yieldingness and doing what any one asked her
i did think so and it is perfectly bewildering to think after all that she should be obstinate and deceiving and yet look so different
said lucilla
but if it has come to that we must be firm mr beverley
if you ask my opinion i say she should be allowed to marry him
that would solve everything you know miss marjoribanks added with sad decision
she would get all the fortune without going to law and she would be settled and off one's mind
that would be my final advice if everything has happened as you say
mr beverley was driven as nearly out of his senses by this counsel as it was possible for a man of ordinary selfcontrol and warm temper to be
he got up again and made a stride to and fro and wiped the moisture from his forehead which as lucilla remarked at the moment had a lowchurch look which she would not have expected from him
but on the other hand he gave vent to some stifled and unintelligible exclamations which whatever they might be were not blessings
then he came to himself a little which was what miss marjoribanks was most afraid of and stood over her large and imposing as before
tell me for heaven's sake what you mean
cried the archdeacon
you do not think surely that i for a moment meant to imply that helen would waste a thought upon such a miscreant
good heavens marry him
you must be raving
she would as soon think ofgoing for a soldier said mr beverley with a hoarse and perfectly unmirthful laugh or doing anything else that was mad and unnatural
that is how you women stand up for your friendsalways ready to suggest something inconceivably horrible and debasing
happily you always go too far he added once more wiping his forehead
it was a very lowchurch not to say dissenterish sort of thing to do and it unconsciously reduced her adversary's dignity in miss marjoribanks's opinion besides affording a proof that he was not nearly so much convinced of what he said as he professed to be in his secret heart
mr beverley i think you forget a little said lucilla with dignity
i know nobody but yourself who has any suspicions of mrs mortimer
if it had been anybody but you i should have laughed at them
but to return to the question miss marjoribanks added with calm grace i always used to be taught at mount pleasant that feelings had nothing to do with an abstract subject
i don't see for my part now you have mentioned it why she should not marry him
it would arrange the money matter without any trouble and i have always heard he was very nice said the bold experimentalist fixing her eyes calmly upon the archdeacon's face
i am sure i should never have thought of it if it had been left to me but speaking calmly i don't see the objections now it has been proposed
oh it is only the bell for luncheon that thomas is ringing
is it actually halfpast one
and i expect some people said lucilla
she got up as she spoke and went to the mirror and looked at herself with that beautiful simplicity which was one of miss marjoribanks's distinguishing features
when one has been crying it always shows she said with a little anxiety
as for mr beverley his state of mind as the newspapers say could better be imagined than described
i must go away he said taking up his hat
i don't feel capable of meeting strangers after this exciting conversation
miss marjoribanks continued the archdeacon taking her hand and holding it fast over his hat to give emphasis to his address at least i can trust to you not to breathe a word to mrs mortimernot a syllableof the horrible suggestion which has got utterance i don't know how
i may surely trust to your honour mr beverley said with emphasis but by this time miss marjoribanks considered it time to bring the crisis to an end
i wish you would stay to luncheon she said there are only one or two of my friends
as for honour you know you gentlemen say that we have no sense of honour said lucilla airily and to think that two women could be together and not talk of what might perhaps be a marriage  at this moment some one rang the doorbell
lucilla knew perfectly well that it was only the baker but it could not be expected that the archdeacon should be similarly initiated into the secrets of the house
he thought as was natural that it was the people she expected and almost wrung her hand as he let it go
you will let me see you again first he said in a tone of entreaty
before you see her you will let me see you again
for heaven's sake don't refuse me cried mr beverley
if anybody had but heard him
as lucilla said to herself the minute he was gone
and the truth was that thomas did hear him who had just opened the door to tell his young mistress that her luncheon was waiting and whom the archdeacon did all but knock downstairs in his sudden and unlookedfor exit
the impression naturally conveyed to thomas by these words was of the clearest and most distinct description
he was even known to say afterwards that he never knew a gentleman as spoke more plain
but mr beverley rushed downstairs without thinking of thomas in a most unenviable frame of mind into the rain
he was more afraid of meeting miss marjoribanks's friends than a man of his size and principles should have been afraid of meeting anybody but then there is a vast distinction as everybody is aware and no one more than the archdeacon between physical and moral strength
as for lucilla her tears and anxieties passed off in a miraculous manner as soon as her visitor was gone
she went downstairs and ate her luncheon with the serenest brow and a most agreeable ladylike appetite
and it was not a fib as may perhaps be supposed that she was expecting peoplefor at that hour miss marjoribanks always did expect people who to be sure might be kept back by the rain but whom she was always justified in looking for
perhaps on the whole notwithstanding her warm sense of the duties of hospitality lucilla was glad that it rained so heavily and that nobody came
she had a great deal to think of as she took her maidenly and delicate repast
the first step had been taken and taken triumphantly
henceforward whatever the archdeacon's illusions might be he could no longer stand calm upon his eminence and conclude that it was he and he alone who could raise the widow from her lowly estate
lucilla it is true knew that no such idea as that of marrying her uncle's heir would ever present itself to mrs mortimer and thatat least so far as miss marjoribanks's information wentsuch a thought was equally removed from the mind of the personage unknown whom mr beverley denounced as an impostor
but this did not in the least affect the value of the suggestion as an instrument to be used against the archdeacon who was big enough to defend himself and on whose account the young philanthropist had no compunctions
the first step was thus taken and taken successfully but it was only after this that the real difficulties began and lucilla knew no more as yet how she was to find and identify not to say assail and vanquish the other side the mysterious mr kavan the man whom the archdeacon abused and the widow defended than even the greatest military genius knows at the commencement of the first campaign how to conduct the second
this was what she considered so closely as she sat alone in the dull afternoon
she did not go to mrs mortimer because it was impossible that every day could be a halfholiday and because on the whole she judged it best not to subject herself in the present undeveloped state of the position to much questioning but she sent her a little note to satisfy her mind telling her to keep herself easy and not to let the archdeacon bully her and to confide in the devotion of her affectionate lucilla
when she had thus satisfied the immediate demands of friendship miss marjoribanks took her work and sat down to reflect
nothing could be more exciting than the position in which she found herself but the difficulties were only such as stimulated her genius and then it was not any selfish advantage but the good of her neighbour in its most sublime manifestationthe good of her neighbour who had injured her and been insensible to her attractions which according to the world in general is the one thing unpardonable to a womanwhich lucilla sought
and it was not even the scriptural coals of fire she was thinking of as she pondered her great undertaking in her mind
the enterprise might not be free from a touch of human vanity but it was vanity of a loftier description the pleasure of exercising a great faculty and the natural confidence of genius in its own powers
chapter xxv   the fruit of lucilla's long and mature reflection was that next morning being fine and all the clouds dispersed she went out with her usual firm step and selfpossession and what was rather unusual with her except on necessary occasions of ceremony knocked at mrs woodburn's door
mrs woodburn and miss marjoribanks had never as people say taken to each other
they were as different in their ways as it is possible to imagine
the mimic was a little indolent and would not take the trouble to make any exertions for the good of the community except in the exercise of her peculiar talent though she had been known when excited to go through real fatigue for that but she had none of the steady force the persevering energyor to sum up all in one word the geniusof miss marjoribanks who for her part recognised the use of such an instrument of entertainment as mrs woodburn possessed without appreciating it in her own person for lucilla had no sense of humour as she candidly admitted with that consciousness of her own faults and slight disposition to consider them virtues which is common to persons of great endowments
it was accordingly with a slight sense of effort on both sides that they met thus in the familiarity of an early visit at a moment when people doing their duty to each other in a ceremonial way would not have thought of calling
she was aware that mrs woodburn regarded her even when she kissed her in the most neighbourly and affectionate manner with a look which seemed to say what can she want coming here so early
as for lucilla she was too wise to pretend that it was a mere visit of regard
she was too wise and her interlocutor was too clever and prone to catch every touch of expression though miss marjoribanks flattered herself she had sufficient experience to enable her to dismiss when there was occasion for it all expression from her face
but such was not her policy at this moment
when the two faces had touched each other in that loving and sisterly salutation their owners immediately separated and regarded each other from two opposite chairs without decided hostility it is true but with the watchful air of two people whom the fates may range on different sides and whom it behoves to be mutually watchful
and lucilla thought it the most expedient course under the circumstances to begin her investigations at once
i have come to make an inquisition she said i may as well confess it at once for you would find me out if i didn't
mrs woodburn where is mr cavendish
i am not going to put up with it any longer
he must be written to and had back again
the only man that was to be depended upon in carlingford
said lucilla and to think he should disappear like this and never say a word
mrs woodburn fairly gasped in her companion's face
she could no more tell what this meant than if she had been a person utterly unacquainted with human motives and ways of working and indeed it was only the tricks of the surface for which she had any real insight
my brother
she exclaimed with something between an impulse of defence and denial and a quite opposite instinct of confidence
had he proposed after all without telling his sister
had lucilla a right to ask the question she uttered so frankly
had he been prudent for once in his life and secured this sensible alliance and prop to his position
all these questions rushed at lightningspeed through mrs woodburn's mind but she was not so prompt as miss marjoribanks would have been under the circumstances and all she did was to open her eyes wide and give a start on her chair and say my brother
with a voice which trembled and was half extinguished by surprise
yes mr cavendish said lucilla
do tell me his address
there is not a man in carlingford who is good for anything now that he is gone
you must see that as well as i do
as for flirting i have always said he was the only man that knew anything about it
do tell me where he is and i will write to him or please send him word for me that absolutely he must come back
we are all dying for him you may say
mrs woodburn had recovered a little and found a moment to think but her faculties were not so handy except in her own particular way as might have been expected from such a clever woman
she could even at that moment have taken off miss marjoribanks to the life but she was in the most profound bewilderment as to what lucilla could mean whether she was really laying herself out to catch mr cavendish or whether she was merely talking nonsense without any particular meaning or whether she was feigning indifference by way of getting information and the stupidest person in carlingford would have acquitted herself as well as mrs woodburn felt able to do in the emergency
i should think he would rather hear that some of you were willing to live for him she said in a tremulous way finding nothing better come to her lips than the echo of an old compliment which went against her nature but yet with an instinct of serving her brother so far as it might be in her power
not me said lucilla frankly
some people once thought so you know but i can't say i ever thought so
there never will be anything about living or dying between him and me
i hope we know better said miss marjoribanks besides if i were so much as to think of that sort of thing i should feel i was swindling papa
oh no i assure you i am quite disinterested
i want him for my thursdays
do write and say he must come home
i don't like people to be too disinterested said mrs woodburn and i don't think harry would be at all glad to hear it
i wish he would come back i am sure
i am always bullying him about it
i thought perhaps some of you young ladies had been unkind to him said the anxious sister who had recovered her head and thought it might be possible to get at the secret if there was a secret by means like this
no said miss marjoribanks i have not been unkind to him and there is nobody else i know of said the candid lucilla unless poor barbara and she will never be unkind you know
i will write him a letter if you will give me his address
is it true that somebody has left him a great deal of money and he is going to change his name
his name
said mrs woodburn with a little cry like an imprudent woman and then she recovered herself
i have not heard of anything of the kind she said and he would be sure to tell me of it but in carlingford people know things before they happen
i should be very glad to know that somebody was going to leave him a great deal of money but i don't know about the name  oh i heard it only in a confused sort of way said lucilla or that he had changed his name
i am sure i don't know if it was past or present
did he ever make any change to be somebody's heir
oh i beg your pardon but you know people do it every day
mrs woodburn had grown quite paleperhaps because she began to see that there was some method in these questions perhaps with simple and unreasonable fright at the suggestion
she could not say a word for a moment so startling was the question and then there was something in lucilla's early visit and in her instant onslaught upon mr cavendish which was alarming
she was so frightened and driven into a corner that she could not tell how to answer
it occurred to her all at once that perhaps mr cavendish had opened his heart to miss marjoribanks and given her an inkling of his secret and what would lucilla think if she contradicted her brother
never was a poor woman in a greater difficulty
all her fun and her mimicry collapsed
she no more noticed the peculiarities of lucilla's look and manner than if she had been an ordinary inhabitant of grange lane
changed his name
she faltered in a blank sort of interrogative way and in spite of herself faltered and shook and conveyed to lucilla the most perfect assurance that what she supposed was true
when it is for a great deal of money there is some sense in it when it is only for a prettier name it is dreadfully stupid
don't you think so
as if we all could have pretty names
said lucilla
i should like so much to have a talk with mr cavendish
i picked up some very very old friends of his the other daypeople who used to know him long ago
i am sure he would be interested if he were to know
i don't think it could be him said mrs woodburn with something like the instinct of despair i don't remember any very old friends he has it is so long a time ago and then the poor lady stopped short as if she had something choking her in her throat
i don't think it could be he
not such a very long time said lucilla in her easy way
it is dreadful to give him a character for being old
do write him please and tell him about those people
he is sure to be interested if you say it is a lady and a pretty woman and a widow continued miss marjoribanks
she says he was once very kind to her when her poor husband was alive
mrs woodburn recovered herself a little as lucilla spoke
it must have been some other mr cavendish she said
harry wasso much abroadso long away from home at that moment there was a sound in the house of a heavy step and mr woodburn's whistle became audible in the distance
then the poor woman who had a secret fixed haggard eyes upon miss marjoribanks
she dared not say don't speak of this before my husband
she dared not utter a word to awaken suspicion on one side or the other
she knew very well that if mr woodburn heard of the existence of any old friends of his brotherinlaw he would insist upon having them produced and paying them some attention and at the same time mrs woodburn could not so far confide in lucilla as to beg her to keep silent
this was what her brother's poltroonery brought upon the unfortunate woman
and when the emergency came she was not as equal to it as she expected to be
her talents were not of a nature to do her any good in such a strait
she collapsed entirely and looked round her in a flutter of fright and despair as if to find some means of escape
but this terror all arose from the fact that she did not know miss marjoribanks who was generous as she was strong and had no intention of going to extremities
lucilla got up from her chair when she heard mr woodburn's whistle coming nearer
i hear somebody coming she said and i must not stay for i have quantities of things to do
only mind you tell mr cavendish i have something quite serious to say to him from his old friend and from me please to tell him that it is impossible to get on without him continued lucilla as mr woodburn entered the room
there is not a soul that can flirt or do anything
i should write to him myself if i knew his address
and then as was natural woodburn with his usual absurdity as his wife explained afterwards struck in with some boisterous badinage
as for mrs woodburn in her mingled terror and relief she was too much excited to know what he said
but when lucilla serenely smiling was gone the mimic with her nerves strung to desperation burst into the wildest comic travesty of miss marjoribanks's looks and manners and her inquiries about harry and sent her unsuspicious husband into convulsions of laughter
he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeksthe unconscious simpleton and all the time his wife could have liked to throw him down and trample on him or put pins into him or scratch his beaming jovial countenance
perhaps she would have gone into hysterics instead if she had not possessed that other safetyvalve for mrs woodburn had not that supreme composure and selfcommand which belonged to lucilla's higher organisation
she wrote a long letter that afternoon and had a dreadful headache all the evening after it which considering all things was to be expected under the circumstances and was a weakminded woman's last resource
no headache however disturbed miss marjoribanks's beneficent progress
she went home conscious that if she had not acquired any distinct information she had at least gained a moral certainty
and besides she had measured the forces of mr cavendish's bodyguard and had found them utterly unequal to any prolonged resistance
all that was wanted was prudence and care and that good luck which was as much an endowment in its way as the other qualities by which lucilla might be said to have secured it
she went home meditating her next step and with a certain enjoyment in the sense of difficulty and the consciousness of how much skill and power would be required to carry on three different threads of innocent intrigue with the three different persons in the drama without ever letting the general web get confused or confounding one strand with another
she had to frighten the archdeacon with the idea that mrs mortimer might marry the impostor and she had to keep the widow in the profoundest ignorance of this suggestion and she had to manage and guide the impostor himself to save his position and deliver him from his enemies and make his wouldbe persecutor for ever harmless
if by chance she should forget herself for a moment and say to mr beverley what she meant for mr cavendish or betray her mode of dealing with either to the third person interested then farewell to all her hopes
but when all that was required was skill and selfpossession and courage miss marjoribanks knew herself too well to be afraid
she came in with that sense of having done her duty which is so sweet to a wellregulated mind
but it was not to that internal satisfaction alone that providence limited lucilla's reward
there are exceptional cases to be found here and there even in this world in which virtue finds its just acknowledgment and disinterested welldoing is recompensed as it deserves
while miss marjoribanks was still occupied with the arrangement of her plans she was interrupted by a visitor who entered with a brow clouded by care and yet exalted by the sense of a charge and dignity which is not afforded to every woman
it was mrs centum who thus came to unfold to lucilla the new event which was about to happen in carlingford
she had a great deal to say first as was natural of the dreadful vexation of such a thing happening in holidaytime when the boys were all at home and when she did not know what to do
but you know lucilla it will be delightful for all you young ladies to have the officers said mrs centum it keeps a place lively though for my part i always say in six months there will not be a servant in the house that one can depend upon
it is dreadful for servantsespecially young ones and if they are nicelooking you know but it is very nice for the young ladies and for all the picnics and dances and everything  what officers
said lucilla pricking up her earsfor to tell the truth the very name of officers in a place like carlingford where nobody could flirt but mr cavendish was as water in the desert to miss marjoribanks's soul
has not the doctor told you
said mrs centumbut to be sure very few people know as yet
mr centum says it must be all on your account because you give such nice partiesbut of course that is only his fun you know
however i suppose somebody has told lord palmerston of all those great buildings that were meant for the factories and of carlingford being such a healthy place
and so the general is coming to us tomorrow lucillageneral travers you know that was in all the papers for something he did in india charles used to know him at school
he is quite handsome and has ever so many medals and things
it is a dreadful addition to one's troubles in holidaytime you know but my dear i hope you will ask him to your thursdays and help us to make carlingford pleasant to him
it all depends upon him said mrs centum solemnlyif he likes the place and thinks it will do and finds nice societywhether it is here or at hampton that they establish the depot
at hampton
cried miss marjoribanks naturally excitedthe stupidest wretchedest little place  that is just what mr centum says said the visitor with a sigh what i am nervous about is the servants lucilla and you know that undernurse of mine what a nice steady girl she has always been and such a comfortbut as soon as the soldiers come it turns their heads
i want you to tell me if you'll be so very good lucilla how nancy makes that pat that mr centum is so fond of
i know it is a good deal to ask but i am sure you are one to stand by your friends and if the general should take a dislike to carlingford through any fault of mine i never could forgive myself and i want you to ask him to your thursdays lucillathere's a dear
dear mrs centum cried miss marjoribanks papa must call on the general and ask him to dinner as for my thursdays i always say they are not parties they are only evenings said lucilla sweetly and not worth a gentleman's while
and about the pat lucilla said mrs centum anxiously i hope you won't think it too much of me to askyou are so clever you know and so is nancy and what with the noise and the nursery dinners and all those big boys home from school  mrs centum fixed her eyes with true solicitude on lucilla's face
miss marjoribanks was magnanimous but the pat in question was one of the greatest triumphs of the doctor's table
she thought and with truth that it was a great deal for any one to ask but then it is true that genius has duties as well as privileges and to impress upon mediocrity the benefit of loyally following and copying superior intelligence is of itself a moral effect of the greatest importance
and besides the woman who at such a moment produced a live general in carlingford and held out hopes of officers was not a woman to be denied
i will write it down for you said lucilla graciously if you think your cook will understand or perhaps nancy might step in and show her howif i can persuade nancy
dear mrs centum i hope you will always feel sure that i am ready to do anything for my friends
oh thank you dear cried the grateful woman i knew you were not one to mind and if nancy would be so very kindi am sure you will like the general added mrs centum with effusion he will live here you know if the depot comes and be such an addition
i said to charles the moment he told me that would just be the very thing for lucilla
and he is quite young looking and so nice and pleasant she added in the fulness of her enthusiasm and gratitude
as for miss marjoribanks she shook her head but nevertheless received the assurance with a smile
it is not that sort of thing i am thinking of said lucilla if it had been i need never have come home and now after papa has been so kind about the drawingroom but i am always glad to hear of nice new people said miss marjoribanks and to meet a man that has been in the world is such a pleasure to papa
with this benign acknowledgment of the general's merits lucilla received mrs centum's affectionate leavetakings
to be sure she knew nothing and did not occupy herself much at that moment about general travers
but at the same time miss marjoribanks with her usual piety recognised the approval of providence in this new occurrence and was naturally both encouraged and exhilarated
it is but in rare cases as has been said that the reward of virtue is given so promptly and with such beautiful discrimination and there are even people in the world who profess to have no faith in any prompt or visible recompense
but lucilla was not of that new and heretical school
for her own part she felt it very natural that her exertions for the good of her kind should thus be recognised and acknowledged and returned to her plans with that sweet and exhilarating sense of moral harmony which an approving heaven and a sense of blessings earned and goodness recompensed are so well calculated to give
chapter xxvi   miss marjoribanks's mind had scarcely subsided out of the first exhilarating sense of a great many things to do and a truly important mission in hand when little rose lake sought her with that confession of family troubles and prayer for counsel and aid in the extremity which opened a new way and mode of working to lucilla
rose was proud poor little soul not only of her exceptional position and that of her family as a family of artists but also with a constitutional and individual pride as one of the natural conservators of domestic honour who would rather have died than have heard the lakes lightly spoken of or upbraided with debt or indecorum or any other crime
she had been silent as long as she could about barbara's shortcomings jealously concealing them from all the world and attacking them with a violence which made her big elder sister who was twice as big and six times as strong as she tremble before her when they were alone
but little rose had at length found things come to a point beyond which her experience did not go
barbara began to have secret meetings with a man whose presence nobody was aware of and who did not come openly to the house to seek her and persevered in spite of all remonstrances in this clandestine career and all the prejudices and all the instincts of the young artist rose up against her
a vague presentiment of greater evil behind impelled her to some action and shame and pride combined at the same time to keep her silent
she could not speak to her father because the poor man lost his head straightway and made piteous appeals to her not to make a fuss and threw the burden back again upon her with a double weight and besides he was only a man though he was her father and rose had the pride of a woman in addition to her other pride
in these painful circumstances it occurred to her to consult lucilla who had been as has been recounted in an early part of this history a great authority at mount pleasant where her heroic belief in herself led as was natural others to believe in her
and then miss marjoribanks was one of the people who can keep counsel and rose felt besides that lucilla had been injured and had not revenged herself and that to put confidence in her would be to a certain extent to make up for the offence
all these motives combined with an intolerable sense of having upon her shoulders a burden greater than she could bear drove the young artist at last to grange lane where lucilla as we have said was still in the state of mental exhilaration and excitement naturally consequent upon having a very important piece of work in hand
i don't know what to do said rose i made up my mind i never would say a word to any one
it is so strange she should have no proper pride
but then it is dreadful to think what if anything should come of it
though i am sure i don't know what could come of it but they might run away or something and then people are so fond of talking
i thought for a long time if i only knew some nice old lady but then i don't suppose there are any nice old ladies in carlingford added the preraphaelist with a sigh
oh you little monster
cried lucilla there is mrs chiley the dearest old but never mind make haste and tell me all the same
lucilla said rose solemnly we are not great people like you we are not rich nor able to have all we like and everybody to visit us but all the same we have our pride
the honour of a family is just as precious whether people live said the young artist with a certain severity in grove street or in grange lane
this exordium had its natural effect upon miss marjoribanks her imagination leaped forward a long way beyond the reality which her companion talked of so solemnly and she changed her colour a little as even a woman of her experience might be excused for doing in the presence of something terrible and disastrous so near at hand
i wish you would not frighten me said lucilla i am very sorry for you you dear little rose
you are only a baby yourself and ought not to have any bother
tell me all about it there's a dear
but these soothing tones were too much for rose's composure
she cried and her cheeks flushed and her dewy eyes enlarged and lightened when they had thrown off a little part of their oppression in the form of those hot salt tears
miss marjoribanks had never seen her look so pretty and said so to herself with a momentary and perfectly disinterested regret that there was nobody to see hera regret which probably changed its character before rose left the house
but in the meantime lucilla soothed her and kissed her and took off her hat and shed her pretty curls off her forehead
these curls were not by any means so strong and vehement in their twist as miss marjoribanks's own but hung loosely and softly with the sweet neglect of the poet
you would look very nice if you would take a little pains lucilla said in her maternal way
you must wear your hair just so on thursday and now tell me all about itthere's a dear
lucilla you know said rose drying her tears she has taken to going out in the evening and i am sure she meets him every night
i can't be a spy on her whatever she does and i can't lock her up you know or lock the door or anything like that
i am not her mother said the poor little sister pathetically with a regretful sob
and then she has taken to making herself nice before she goes out
i don't think she ever cared much for being nicenot at home you know but now she has pretty collars and gloves and things and i can't tell where she gets them cried rose her eyes lighting up passionately
she has no money to spend on such things
lucilla i should die if i thought she would accept them from him
you dear old rose you don't know what you are saying said the experienced lucilla most likely if she meets a gentleman she is engaged to him and they always give people presents you know
if you would only tell me who it is
lucilla do not trifle with me said rose it is much too serious for thatengaged without papa knowing of it nor me
you know very well that would be no engagement
i sometimes think she isisfond of him said the reverent little maiden whose voice changed and softened under the influence of that supposition and then again i think it is only because he is rich she went on with new vehemence
oh lucilla if you only knew how dreadful it was to have such thoughtsand there is nobody to take care of her but me
papa cannot be worried for that would react upon everything
an artist is not just like other people
it is everybody's duty to leave him undisturbed and then you know he is only a man and does not understand and if she won't pay any attention to me when i speak to her oh lucilla tell me what can i do
let me think said lucilla gravely
you know i can't tell all in a moment
it is mr cavendish i suppose though you won't say so
now just wait a moment and let me think
i once thought of going to him said rose perhaps he might be generous and go away
an artist can do many things that other people can't do
we have an exceptional position the preraphaelist went on faltering a little and not feeling quite so sure of the fact on that special occasion
i thought of going and begging of him if it was on my knees  my dear said lucilla with great seriousness if you did i think it is most likely he would fall in love with you and that would not mend the matter and i am sure barbara would give you poison
i will tell you what we must do
i would not do it for everybody but you know i was always very fond of you you dear little rose
you shall ask me for tomorrow evening to come to tea
to come to tea
echoed poor rose in dismay
she had been waiting for lucilla's advice with a great deal of anxiety but at the present moment it would be vain to conceal that the proposed expedient seemed to her altogether inadequate for the emergency
the light went out of her face as she opened her eyes wide and fixed them on lucilla and for one moment one desperate moment rose was disloyal and lost faith in the only person who could help her which perhaps under the circumstances was not a thing to cause much surprise
my dear you may be sure i would not propose it if i did not feel it was the best thing to do said lucilla with great gravity
it happens precisely that i want to see mr cavendish and if he is at home he never shows himself and i have been wondering how i could find him
i shall make him walk home with me said miss marjoribanks so you need not be uneasy rose about the trouble i am taking
i am doing it to serve myself as well as you
we shall say eight o'clock if that is not too late
but lucilla said rose with consternation and then she stopped short and could not tell what more to say
you don't understand it
said miss marjoribanks i don't think it was to be expected that you should understand it
a little thing like you has no way of knowing the world
when barbara knows i am there she will be sure to bring him to the very door she will want me to see that he is with her and you may leave the rest to me said lucilla
for my part i have something very particular to say to mr cavendish
it is my luck miss marjoribanks added for i could not think how to get to see him
at eight o'clock tomorrow evening  yes said rose but perhaps it was still doubtful how far she understood the mode of operations proposed
lucilla's prompt and facile genius was too much for the young artist and there was as she herself would have said an entire want of keeping between her own sense of the position tragical and desperate as that was and any state of matters which could be ameliorated by the fact of miss marjoribanks coming to tea
it had been rose's only hope and now it seemed all at once to fail her and yet at the same time that instinctive faith in lucilla which came naturally to every one under her influence struggled against reason in rose's heart
her red soft lips fell apart with the hurried breath of wonder and doubt her eyes still expanded and clearer than usual after their tears were fixed upon lucilla with an appealing questioning look and it was just at this moment when rose was a great deal too much absorbed in her disappointment and surprise and lingering hope to take any notice of strange sounds or sights or of anybody coming that thomas all at once opened the door and showed mrs centum into the room
now it would have mattered very little for mrs centumwho to be sure knew lucilla perfectly well and would never have dreamed for a moment of identifying such a trifling little person as rose lake in any way with miss marjoribanks but then mrs centum happened at that precise moment to be bringing the new arrival the important stranger who had so much in his powergeneral travers himselfto be introduced to lucilla and it was not the fault either of rose or the general if it was on the young mistress of the female school of design that the warrior's first glance fell
naturally the conversation had run upon miss marjoribanks on the past evening for mrs centum was full of the enthusiasm and excitement incident to that pat which lucilla had so magnanimously enabled her to produce
is she pretty
general travers had demanded as was to be expected
well mrs centum had replied and made a long pausewould you call lucilla pretty charles
and charles had been equally dubious in his response for to be sure it was a dereliction from miss marjoribanks's dignity to call her pretty which is a trifling sort of qualification
but when the general entered the drawingroom which might be called the centre of carlingford and saw before him that little dewy face full of clouds and sunshine uncertain unquiet openeyed with the red lips apart and the eyes clear and expanded with recent tearsa face which gave a certain sentiment of freshness and fragrance to the atmosphere like the quiet after a stormhe did not understand what his hosts could mean
i call her very pretty he said under his breath to his interested and delighted chaperone and we are surely justified in appealing to the readers of this history as lucilla who was always reasonable afterwards did to herself whether it could be justly said under all the circumstances that either rose or the general were to blame
the little artist got up hurriedly when she awoke to the fact that other visitors had come into the room but she was not at all interested in general travers whom rose with the unconscious insolence of youth classified in her own mind as an elderly gentleman
not that he was at all an elderly gentleman but then a man of forty especially when he is a fine man and adequately developed for his years has at the first glance no great attraction for an impertinent of seventeen
rose did not go away without receiving another kiss from lucilla and a parting reminder
tomorrow at eight o'clock and mind you leave it all to me and don't worry said miss marjoribanks and rose half ashamed put on her hat and went away without so much as remarking the admiration in the stranger's eyes nor the look of disappointment with which he saw her leave the room
rose thought no more of him than if he had been a piece of furniture but as for the general when he found himself obliged to turn to lucilla and make himself agreeable the drawback of having thus had his admiration forestalled and drawn away from its legitimate object was such that he did not find her at all pretty which after all on a first interview at least is all they think about as miss marjoribanks herself said
we must do all we can to make carlingford agreeable to the general said mrs centum
you know how much depends upon it lucilla
if we can but make him like the place only think what an advantage to societyand we have such nice society in carlingford said the injudicious woman who did not know what to say
nothing very particular said miss marjoribanks
i hope general travers will like us but as for the officers i am not so sure
they are all so light and airy you know and to have nothing but flirting men is almost as bad as having nobody that can flirt which is my position lucilla added with a sigh as long as mr cavendish is away
lucilla cried mrs centum a little shocked one would think to hear you that you were the greatest coquette possible and on the contrary she is quite an example to all our young ladies i assure you general and as for flirting  dear mrs centum said lucilla sweetly one has always to do one's duty to society
as far as i am concerned it is quite different
and i don't mean to say that the officers would not be a great acquisition miss marjoribanks continued with her usual politeness but then too many young people are the ruin of society
if we were to run all to dancing and that sort of thing after all the trouble one has taken said lucilla
perhaps it was not quite civil but then it must be admitted that to see a man look blankly in your face as if he were saying in his mind then it is only you and not that pretty little thing that is miss marjoribanks
was about as exasperating a sensation as one is likely to meet with
lucilla understood perfectly well general travers's look and for the moment instead of making herself agreeable it was the contrary impulse that moved her
she looked at him not blankly as he looked at her but in a calmly considerate way as she might have looked at mr holden the upholsterer had he proposed a new kind of tapisserie to her judgment
one would be always delighted of course to have general travers said miss marjoribanks but i am afraid the officers would not do
as for mrs centum she was quite incapable of managing such a terrible crisis
she felt it indeed a little hard that it should be her man who was defied in this alarming way while mr cavendish and the archdeacon the two previous candidates had both been received so sweetly
to be sure it was his own fault but that did not mend matters
she looked from one to the other with a scared look and grew very red and untied her bonnet and then as none of these evidences of agitation had any effect upon the other parties involved plunged into the heat of the conflict without considering what she was about to say
lucilla i am surprised at you said mrs centum when you know how you have gone on about mr cavendishwhen you know what a fuss you have made and how you have told everybody  by the bye who is mr cavendish
said general travers interposing with that holy horror of a quarrel between women which is common to the inferior half of creation
i wonder if he is a fellow one used to meet everywhere
one never could get any satisfaction who he belonged to
he never pretended to be one of the devonshire cavendishes you know
i don't know if he had any family at all or relations or that sort of thing
in most cases a man gets on just as well without them in my opinion
i wonder if this fellow you are talking of is he
oh no said mrs centum
i hope you will meet him before you leave carlingford
he has a sister married here but we have always understood he was one of the cavendishes
i am sure mrs woodburn always gives herself out for somebody she continued beginning to let the interesting suspicion enter her mind for to be sure they were about of a standing and the banker's wife had sometimes felt a little sore at the idea that her neighbour possessed distinctions of family which were denied to herself
it is true none of her relations ever come to see her said mrs centum and she began to forget the general and lucilla's reception of him in this still more interesting subject
it was the first time that the authenticity of the cavendishes had been attacked in carlingford and to be sure what is the good of having fine connections if they cannot be produced
while mrs centum pondered a suggestion so interesting lucilla on her part also took advantage of the occasion and descended from the calm heights of dignity on which she had placed herself
and the general who was a wellbred man had got over for the moment the unlucky impression made upon him by the fresh face of little rose lake
mr cavendish is very nice said miss marjoribanks
i am very fond of all my own relations but i don't care about other people's
of course he is one of the cavendishes
i don't see how he can help it when that is his name
i should think it was sure to be the same
we should be so obliged to you if you would bring him back to carlingford
i don't know i am sure why he is so obstinate in staying away
perhaps somebody has been unkind to him said the general feeling it was expected of him
i am sure i have not been unkind to him said lucilla
he is such a loss to me
if you are going to do us the pleasure of coming on thursdayoh i am sure we shall feel quite honoured both papa and ii will show you how badly off i am
it is not a party in the least and we don't dance said miss marjoribanks that is why i am a little uncertain about the officers
it is one of my principles that too many young people are the ruin of society but it is hard work sometimes when one is not properly supported lucilla added with a gentle sigh
if i can be of any use said the amused soldier
i don't pretend to be able to replace cavendish if it is cavendish but  no said miss marjoribanks with resignation it is not easy to replace him
he has quite a talent you know but i am sure it is very kind of you and we shall be delighted to have such an acquisition lucilla continued after a pause with a gracious smile and then she led her guests downstairs to luncheon which was every way satisfactory
as for the general it cannot be doubted that he had the worst of it in this little encounter and felt himself by no means such a great personage in carlingford as his hospitable entertainers had persuaded him he should be
mrs centum declared afterwards that she could not form the least idea what lucilla meant by it she who was generally so civil to everybody
but it is not necessary to say that miss marjoribanks knew perfectly well what she was doing and felt it imperatively necessary to bring down general travers to his proper level
carlingford could exist perfectly well without him and his officers but lucilla did not mean that the society she had taken so much pains to form should be condescended to by a mere soldier
and then after all she was only human and it was not to be expected she could pass over the blank look with which her visitor turned to herself after having by evil fortune cast his eyes upon rose lake
at the same time miss marjoribanks always magnanimous did not blame rose who had no hand whatever in the matter and if she avenged herself in a ladylike and satisfactory manner it is not to be supposed that it was simply a sense of offence which actuated lucilla
she did it on the contrary on strictly philosophical principles having perceived that mrs centum was spoiling her general and that it was absolutely necessary that he should be disabused
when they left mrs centum was almost afraid to put the question that trembled on her lips
she uttered it at last faltering and with a very doubtful expression for she could not conceal from herself the fact that the general had been snubbed
how do you like lucilla
she said in the most humble way and then she turned away her face
she could bear it whatever it might be
she said to herself that so long as the children were well and the holidays about over she could bear anything and what did it matter to her about the officersbut at the same time she preferred to avert her face when she received the blow
i am sure miss marjoribanks is a person for whom i shall always entertain the highest respect said the general and he gave a little laugh
was that pretty little creature a sister of hersor a friendor what
i don't know when i have seen anything so pretty said the unsuspecting man and then mrs centum turned round upon him with a kind of horror
that lucilla's sisterwhy she has no sister i told you so she is an only child and will have everything
she will be quite an heiress cried mrs centum if the old doctor were to die though i am sure poor dear man i hope he will not die
there is no other medical man in the town that one can have the least confidence in except dr rider and then he is so young and can't have much experience with children
her sister indeed
it was little rose lake the drawingmaster's daughter said mrs centum with cruel distinctness
the general only said oh
but it was in a crestfallen tone for to be snubbed by one lady and struck with sudden enthusiasm for another who after all was not a lady to speak of but only a drawingmaster's daughter was rather hard upon the poor man
thus it was the soldier who in ordinary circumstances ought to have been the most successful who began in the most cruel and uncomfortable way his campaign in carlingford
chapter xxvii   miss marjoribanks except for her habitual walk did not go out much that day
she was too much occupied with what she had in hand
she could not conceivefor lucilla naturally took a reasonable view of affairs in general and did not account for the action of any such unknown quantity as love for examplewhy mr cavendish should conceal himself so carefully from society in carlingford and yet run all the risk of meeting barbara lake in the evenings
it seemed to lucilla inconceivable and yet it was impossible not to believe it
mr cavendish though she had seen him on the very verge of a proposal did not present himself to her mind in the aspect of a man who would consider the world well lost for any such transitory passion neither as was natural did barbara lake appear to lucilla the least like a person calculated to call forth that sentiment but nevertheless it must be true and the only way to account for it was by thinking after all what fools they were and what poor judges and how little to be depended on when women were concerned
miss marjoribanks was determined to lose no more time but to speak to mr cavendish if it was mr cavendish and she could get the chance quite plainly of the situation of affairsto let him know how much she knew and to spur him up to come forward like a man and brave anything the archdeacon could do
had it been any small personal aim that moved lucilla no doubt she would have shrunk from such a decided step but it was on the contrary the broadest philanthropical combination of christian principles help to the weak and succour to the oppressed and a little just a very little of the equally evangelical idea of humbling the proud and bringing down the mighty
she was so much occupied with her plans that it was with a little difficulty she roused herself to keep up the conversation with her father at dinner and be as amusing and agreeable as ordinary which indeed was more than ordinarily her duty since dr marjoribanks came in in a fractious and disturbed state of mind discontented with things in general
the truth was he had got a letter from tom marjoribanks from india where that unlucky man had gone
it was all very well and natural to go to india and lucilla had felt indeed rather satisfied with herself for having helped forward that desirable conclusion especially after the doctor had taken pains to explain to her not knowing that she had any share in it that it was the very best thing for tom to do
for it has been already said that dr marjoribanks though he liked tom and thought it very odd that providence should have given the girl to him and the boy to his incapable sisterinlaw who did not in the least know how to manage him had no desire to have his nephew for a soninlaw
going to india was very right and proper and the best thing to do for a man might get on there even at the bar who would have no chance here but after he had made one step in the right direction it was only to be expected that all sorts of misfortunes should happen to tom
he was wrecked which might have been looked for and he lost his boxes with the greater part of his outfit either at that unhappy moment or in the desert or at an after part of his unlucky career and the object of the letter which dr marjoribanks had just received was to get money to make up for his losses
tom who was a very good son did not want to vex his mother and accordingly it was his uncle whom he applied to to sell out a portion of the money he had in the funds
she would think i was ruined or that it was my fault or at least that i meant to spend all my money wrote tom and you understand uncle that it is not my fault
confound him
it is never his fault said dr marjoribanks as if that could possibly be brought against the unfortunate young man as a crime
no papa it is his luck said lucilla poor tombut i should not like to take a passage in the same boat with him if i was the other people
though i am sure he is not a bit to blame
i hope he does not mean to go on like this said the doctor
he will soon make ducks and drakes of his five thousand pounds
a young fellow like that ought to mind what he's doing
it is a great deal easier to throw money away than to lay it by
papa it is his luck said miss marjoribanks it is all put into a system in political economy you know
for my part i am always the other way
it is very funny before you get used to it but you know there has to be a balance in everything and that is how it must be
i don't think it at all funny said dr marjoribanks unless your good luck and his bad were to be joined together which is not an expedient i fancy
when he said this the doctor gave a sharp glance at his daughter to see if by chance that might perhaps be what she was thinking of but naturally the maiden candour and unsuspecting innocence of lucilla was proof to such glances
she took no notice at all of the implied suspicion
but though it was very absurd for anybody to think that she would have married him it was not in miss marjoribanks's nature to be disloyal to tom
i think he is quite right about his mother papa said lucilla she would never understand it you know she would think the world was coming to an end
i would not for anything take a passage in the same boat with him but he is nice in his way poor fellow
i wonder what he has ever done to have such dreadful luckbut i hope you are going to do what he asks you and with this calm expression of her interest miss marjoribanks went upstairs
when the doctor became thus aware of his daughter's sentiments it seemed to him that he was more at liberty to be kind to his nephew
he had never been able to divest himself of a little lurking dread an inherent idea which was so obstinate that it felt like a prophecy that somehow or other after costing her father so much and making such a difference in the house lucilla who on the whole was a dear production would fall to tom's share with all dr marjoribanks's other possessions and the doctor saw no reason why he should work and lay up money for a boy whom providence with a wonderful want of discrimination had bestowed not upon him but upon mrs john marjoribanks
however when that question was settled and done with his heart began to relent to tom the unlucky who after all when the soninlaw hypothesis was fully dismissed was his natural born nephew and as lucilla said very nice in his way poor fellow
the doctor began to write him a letter and softened more and more with every line he wrote but as for lucilla she had something more immediately important to occupy her upstairs
the fact was that miss marjoribanks had found a shadowy figure in black in the corner of one of the sofas when she came into the drawingroomafigure with a veil down and a large shawl and a tremulous air
it was very seldom that mrs mortimer took courage to visit her young patroness and to go out at night except sometimes to salem chapel when there was a meeting and when the timid woman represented to herself that it was her duty was a thing unknown to her
but yet nevertheless it was mrs mortimer who sat waiting for lucilla
they had not met since that momentous interview in which the widow revealed her history to miss marjoribanks's sympathetic ears and the poor woman had been able to bear no longer the solitude of her cottage and her gardenwalls and her little pupils and mary jane
to know that something was going on outside that concerned herto hear the waves as it were beating round the walls of her prison and never to have even so much as a peep at them what they were about if the tide was beginning to turn or the wind to change or the lifeboat to appearwas more than mrs mortimer even with all her training to patience could put up with and accordingly she had made a frantic rush out under cover of night to see if there was anything to see and hear if there was anything to hear
you don't know how dreadful it is to keep staring at the walls all day and never see any change said the widow
it is very stupid and silly but you know i cannot help it
i get to fancy always that something wonderful must be going on on the other side
that is because you don't go out enough said lucilla
you know how often i have said you should go out once every day and then you would see that everything outside was very much the same as everything within
oh lucilla
don't say so said mrs mortimer and besides he has been again and i could see you had been saying something to him
he spoke as if i understood it all when i did not understand a word of it and he spoke of him you know and was quite solemn and warned me to think well of it and not do anything rashas if i had anything to think about or was going to do anything
tell me what you said to him lucilla for i am sure by the way he spoke he must have taken him for himself and perhaps you for me
who did he take for himself i wonder
said lucilla
as for you and me dear mrs mortimer we are so different that he could never take us for each other whatever the circumstances might be
ah yes lucilla
we are different said the poor widow
you have all your own people to take care of you and you are not afraid of anybody but as for me i have not a creature in the world who cares what becomes of me
as she made this forlorn statement it was only natural that the poor woman should cry a little
this was no doubt the result of the four gardenwalls that closed in so tightly and the aggravating little pupils but miss marjoribanks felt it was not a state of feeling that could be allowed to go on
you ought not to speak like that i am sure there are a great many people who are interested in you and you have always me said lucilla with a certain reproachful tenderness
as for mrs mortimer she raised her head and dried her eyes when miss marjoribanks began to speak and looked at her in a somewhat eager inquiring way but when lucilla uttered those last reassuring words it is undeniable that the widow's countenance fell a little
she faltered and grew pale again and only cried the moreperhaps with gratitude perhaps with disappointment
and when she said i am sure you are very kind lucilla which was all the poor soul could utter it was in a very tremulous undecided voice
the fact that she had always the sympathy and cooperation of such a friend as miss marjoribanks did not seem to have the exhilarating effect upon her that it ought to have had
it did not apparently do any more for her than the similar reassurance that lucilla was coming to tea did for rose lake
but then like every other benefactor of the human race miss marjoribanks was aware that the human mind has its moments of unbelief
it was a discouraging experience to meet with but she never permitted it seriously to interrupt her exertions for the good of her kind
you should not have so poor an opinion of your friends said lucilla who after all was giving only a stone when her suppliant asked for bread
you know how much interested we all are in you and for me anything i can do  oh lucilla you are very kind nobody could be kinder cried mrs mortimer with compunction
it is very nice to have friends
i do not know what i should do without you i am sure but then one cannot live upon one's friends and then one knows when they go away said the widow with more feeling than distinctness of expression that they all go away to something of their own and pity you or forget you but you always stay there and have nothing of your own to go away to
i am not grumbling but it is hard lucilla and then you are young and happy and at home and i don't think it is possible you can understand
my dear said miss marjoribanks it is quite easy to understand and i know exactly what you mean
you want me to tell you all about mr beverley and what i said to him and what he has in his mind
if he is the something of your own you would like to go away to i think it is a pity
i am sure he has a temper and i would not marry him for my part
but if you mean me i have nothing to go away to said lucilla with a little scorn
i should be ashamed not to be enough for myself
when i leave you it is not to enjoy myself but to think about you and to plan for you and all that you want to know is about him
said miss marjoribanks piercing through and through the thin armour of her incapable assailant
naturally all the widow's defences fell before this ruthless response
she cried with a mingled sensation of shame at being found out and penitence for being so ungrateful and a certain desolate distress with her own incapacity and want of power to defend herself
it was an acute variety of feminine anguish on the whole
the idea that she a mature woman a married woman and widow who ought to have been done with all these vanities should have been found out by a young girl to be thinking about a gentleman struck poor mrs mortimer with a sharp sense of shame as if her wistful preoccupation had been a crime
indeed the chances are if it had been a crime she would not have been nearly so much ashamed of it
she hid her face in her hands and blushed down to the very edge of her black dress and up into the glooms of her widow's veil and all the selfdefence she was capable of was a faint oh lucilla
a mere appeal of weakness without reasona virtual throwing of herself in acknowledged guilt at her judge's feet
thomas is coming with the tea said miss marjoribanks
come into my room and take off your bonnet
what is the good of worrying yourself when you know i have taken it into my own hands
spoiling your eyes with crying and making everybody uncomfortable never does the least good and besides one never knows what harm one might do one's self said lucilla seriously
i don't think you gone off at all for my part but if you don't take proper carei shall give you some rosewater and you will be all right after you have had a cup of tea
oh no it will be best to go home
i am such a poor creature now
i am not good for anything
let me go home lucilla said poor mrs mortimer
but lucilla would not let her go home and by the time tea was ready and dr marjoribanks had come upstairs she had so managed to soothe her visitor's nerves and console her spirits that the doctor himself grew complimentary
he was so civil in fact that lucilla felt slightly startled and on the whole thought it was as well that the archdeacon was at hand and affairs in a promising way for it was doubtful whether even miss marjoribanks's magnanimity could have got over any ridiculous exhibition of interest on the part of her father who certainly was old enough to know better
even to see him taking mrs mortimer's tea to her and congratulating her upon her improved looks and felicitating himself and the world in general on the fact that carlingford agreed with her was aggravating to his daughtermore aggravating though it is strange to say so than even the blank looks of general travers in the morning or his transference of the homage intended for herself to little rose lake that was no more than a blunder and lucilla felt a consolatory conviction that so far as incivility went the general had received a very satisfactory setoff
but to see dr marjoribanks exerting himself in such an unheardof way made her open her eyes
if he were still accessible to such influences nobody could answer for anything that might happen and the widow was so grateful for his kindness that at one moment it was all that lucilla could do to keep her lips shut fast and restrain herself from a tempting allusion which would have made an end of mrs mortimer
it was the first time that lucilla's protge had ventured to come thus familiarly and uninvited to her friend's house and the doctor who knew no special reason for the visit expressed his satisfaction with a warmth which was quite uncalledfor and hoped that lucilla might often have the advantage of her company and actually betrayed symptoms of a disposition to see her home if miss marjoribanks had not already made provision for that emergency
when the visitor had finally departed under the charge of thomas and mary jane the father and daughter regarded each other for the first time with dubious glancesfor as far as lucilla was concerned it was a revelation to her of a new and altogether unsuspected danger and the doctor for his part was very conciliatory and showed a certain consciousness of having committed himself which made matters twenty times worse
really lucilla your friend is a credit to you said dr marjoribanks
it was a stroke of talent to pick her up as you did and make a woman of herand a pretty woman too he added incautiously as if he at his age had anything to do with that
i am so glad you think so papa said lucilla in her dutiful way
i don't think myself that she has gone off at all to speak of
in some lights she might pass for being no older than i amif she was very well dressed you know and it really does not matter what age a woman is if she keeps her looks
i should be very glad to see her nicely married for my part she is one of the people who ought to be married miss marjoribanks continued with an inflection of compassionate tolerance in her voice
as for the doctor he mistook her as usual and took her tone of pity and kindly patronising disdain for another instance of his daughter's policy and high art whereas the truth was she was quite in earnest and meant every word she said
and then dr marjoribanks's sense of humour was keener than that of lucilla
after this the conversation flagged slightly for miss marjoribanks had undeniably received a shock
in the midst of her benevolent preoccupation and care for other people it had suddenly dawned upon her that her own stronghold might be attacked and the tables turned upon her in the twinkling of an eye
there are days of discouragement in the most triumphant career and this was one of those uncomfortable moments
her faith in herself did not fail her for an instant but the faith of her natural born subjectsthe creatures of her bountyhad visibly failed her
neither rose lake nor mrs mortimer had shown that confidence in lucilla's genius which experience and loyalty both called upon them to show
when dr marjoribanks had gone downstairs to resume the case which he was writing out for the lancet lucilla passed through one of those moments of sublime despondency which now and then try the spirits of the benefactors of their race
a few tears came to her eyes as she reflected upon this great problem
without such trials genius would not fully know itself nor be justly aware of its own strength
for no temptation to give up her disinterested exertions had any effect upon the mind of miss marjoribanks and even her sense of pain at the unbelief of her followers was mingled with that pity for their weakness which involves pardon
even when they wounded her she was sorry for them
it was nature that was in fault and not the fallible human creatures who had it not in them to believe in the simple force of genius
when lucilla had shed these few tears over her subjects' weakness and want of faith she rose up again in new strength from the momentary downfall
it was as we have said a sublime moment
the idea of giving them up and leaving their affairs to their own guidance never for an instant penetrated into her heroic mind but she was human and naturally she felt the prick of ingratitude
when the crisis was over she rose up calmly and lighted her candle and went to her room with a smile upon her magnanimous lips
as she performed that simple action lucilla had lifted up the feeble widow and taken the family of lakes and mr cavendish and even the burly archdeacon himself upon her shoulders
they might be ungrateful or even unaware of all she was doing for them but they had the supreme claim of need upon strength and miss marjoribanks notwithstanding the wound they had given her was loyal to that appeal and to her own consciousness of superior power
at the same time it would not be just to omit all mention of a consolatory recollection which occurred to lucilla in this moment of her weakness
at such a crisis the mind of genius may be supported by a matter very trifling in itself
even at the instant when the moisture sprang to her eyes miss marjoribanks said to herself poor tom
and felt that the bitterness to a certain extent had evaporated out of her tears
he was a long way off and lucilla would have thought it madness indeed to connect herself in any way with the fortunes of her unlucky cousin yet it gave her a certain support to think that amid all the want of faith she was encountering tom believed in her heart and soul
it was an insignificant matter so far as any practical result was concerned if indeed anything can be called insignificant which gives strength to a great mind in a moment of discouragement
she said poor tom
and felt as if for the moment she had something to lean on and was comforted
we mention this fact rather as a contribution to the history of those phenomena of the human mind which have as yet escaped the metaphysician than as an actual circumstance in the life of miss marjoribanks
she was a woman of genius and he only a very simple unlucky fellow and yet a sensation of comfort came to lucilla's heart when she said poor tom
chapter xxviii   lucilla prepared her toilette the next evening to take tea with the lakes with greater care than she would have spent upon a party of much greater pretensions
she was to be sure dressed as usual in the white dress high which she had brought into fashion in carlingford but then that simple evening toilette required many adjuncts which were not necessary on other occasions seeing that this time she was going to walk to her destination and had in her mind the four distinct aims of pleasing rose of dazzling barbara of imposing upon mr cavendish and finally of being as always in harmony with herself
she was as punctual to the hour and minute of her engagement as if she had been a queen and indeed it was with a demeanour as gracious that she entered the little house in grove street where naturally there had been also sundry preparations made for her visit
mr lake himself who had postponed his usual walk and was taking his tea an hour later than usual received his young visitor with all the suavity natural to him and as for barbara she did the honours with a certain suppressed exultation and air of triumph which proved to lucilla that her plan was indeed an inspiration of genius
as for rose it would be impossible to describe what were her sensations
her faith still failed her at that momentous hour
she was sceptical of lucilla and naturally of all the world and regarded everybody with jealous scrutiny and expectation and distrust as was natural to a young conspirator
she was profoundly excited and curious to know what miss marjoribanks meant to do and at the same time she did not believe in miss marjoribanks and was almost disposed to betray and interfere with her if such treachery had been possible
it was rose lucilla specially came to visit and yet rose was the only one who was cool to her and did not seem fully to appreciate her condescension but then happily miss marjoribanks was magnanimous and at the same time had a purpose to support her which was much more comprehensive and of larger application than anything that had entered into the mind of rose lake
i am proud to see you in my house miss marjoribanks said mr lake
i have always considered your excellent father one of my best friends
i am not able to give my children the same advantages but i have always brought them up not to have any false pride
we have no wealth but we have some things which cannot be purchased by wealth said the drawingmaster with mild grandeur and he looked round upon the walls of his parlour which were hung with his own drawings and where one of willie's held the place of honour
in all carlingford there was no other house that enjoyed a similar distinction and consequently it was with a delicious sense of chivalrous deference yet equality that the exceptional man of grove street received the young sovereign of grange lane
i am so glad to come mr lake said lucilla
it is so nice to be among such old friends and besides that you know there never was any voice that suited mine like barbara's and that dear old rose was always my pet at mount pleasant
i should have come long ago if anybody had ever asked me said miss marjoribanks
and as for mr lake he was so overpowered by this implied reproach upon his hospitality that he scarcely knew how to reply
my dear miss marjoribanks if you have not been asked it has been from no want ofof goodwill said mr lake anxiously
i do not know what the girls can have been thinking of
you see rose's genius takes another line and barbara naturally has a great many things to think of but in the future i hope  oh yes i shall come without being asked said lucilla
and when the tea came it was all she could do to keep herself quiet and remember that she was a visitor and not take it out of the incapable hands of barbara who never gave her father the right amount of sugar in his tea
to tell the truth barbara's thoughts were occupied by a very different subject and even rose had but little attention to spare for her papa's comforts at that special moment
but lucilla's larger mind embraced everything
she sat with her very fingers itching to cut the breadandbutter for him and give him a cup of tea as he liked it and asked herself with indignation what was the use of that great creature with her level eyebrows and her crimson bloom who could not take the trouble to remember that three lumps was what mr lake liked
miss marjoribanks had never taken tea with him before but his second cup had she dispensed it would have been exactly to his tastewhich was a thing barbara had not learned to make it in all these years
no wonder that a certain sense of contemptuous indignation arose for one moment even in the calm and impartial bosom of genius
perhaps rose would not have done much better but then rose was good for something else which was always a setoff on the other side
thus it will be seen that lucilla had a respect for use even of a kind which in her own person she did not much appreciate as became a person of a truly enlightened mind but a creature who was of no earthly good irritated her wellregulated spirit for to be sure the possession of a fine contralto which is at the same time not fine enough to be made use of professionally is not a matter of sufficient moment in this world to excuse a young woman for not knowing how to give her father a comfortable cup of tea
it was nearly nine o'clock before mr lake went out for his walk and by that time it was almost dark and the lamp outside was lighted which was not far from the door
lucilla had taken a seat near the window with the view of witnessing everything and it cannot be denied that she felt a little excited when barbara went out of the room after her father leaving rose alone with her guest
miss marjoribanks's heart gave a beat or two the more in the first minute though before the next had passed it had fallen into its usual measure
there were no candles as yet in the parlour and grove streetor at least the bit of it which lay before the window lighted by the lamp outside and relieved against a little square of bluishgreen sky which intervened between miss hemmings's house and that of old mr wrangle on the opposite sidewas very clear to the interested spectator
there was nobody visible but an organman who was grinding a popular melody very dolorously out of his box in what rose would have called the middle distance and beyond miss jane hemmings looking out of the long staircase window and three little boys in different attitudes belowthat is if one did not count a tall figure which perhaps with the view of listening to the music of the organ was coming and going in a limited circuit round the light of the lamp
how convenient it is to have the lamp so near said lucilla
oh don't light any candles please it is so nice to sit in the dark
where is barbara i wonder
let us have some music and put down that dreadful organ
i hope she has not gone out
and where are you you sulky little rose
she has gone upstairs said rose who began to feel all the enormity of her conduct in thus betraying her sister
i hate sitting in the dark
i hate being a spy come in from the window lucilla now you are here  my dear rose said miss marjoribanks i think you forget a little
for my part i do not understand what being a spy means
barbara knows very well i am here
i should scorn to take an advantage of anybody for my part
if she does not bring him past the very window and under my eyesah yes that is just what i thought said lucilla with gentle satisfaction
but by this time poor little rose had roused herself into an innocent fury
what is just as you thought
said rose laying an impatient grasp on miss marjoribanks's arm
come in from the window lucilla this momentthis moment
oh me to think it should be my doing
oh lucilla don't be so mean and shabby and wretched
i tell you to come income in directly
if you do not shut the window and come and sit here in the corner i will never never speak to you again
miss marjoribanks as was natural took no notice of this childish fury
she was sitting just where she had been sitting all the evening within sight of the street lamp and the organgrinder and miss jane hemmings at the staircase windowjust where barbara had placed her and where that young woman calculated on finding her when she made a promenade of triumph up the partially lighted street by the side of her clandestine suitor
perhaps barbara had seen miss jane as well and knew that public opinion was thus watching over her but at all events she was not at all ashamed of herself or indignant at being spied upon
on the contrary it was a kind of apotheosis for barbara only second to the grand and crowning triumph which would be accomplished in carlingford church under the shadow of that veil of real brussels which grew more and more real every day
thus neither the actors in the drama nor the principal spectator were in the smallest degree disturbed by horror or shame or sense of guilt excepting always the fanciful little rose who suffered for everybody who could have wished that the earth would open and swallow up barbara and her lover who could have slaughtered lucilla on the spot and given herself over to any kind of torture for her treachery
naturally nobody paid any sort of attention to rose
barbara for her part took her admirer's arm in the twilight with a swelling of exultation which the gaining of the very highest prize in the department of ornamental art could scarcely have conveyed to the bosom of the little artist and lucilla put back her small assailant softly with her hand and smoothed down her ruffled plumes
my dear it is miss hemmings that is spying said lucilla and poor barbara would be so disappointed if i were to go away from the window
have patience just a little longerthere's a dear
it is all exactly as i thought
and then there followed a pause which was a terrible pause for rose
the organgrinder stopped his doleful ditty and there was scarcely any sound to be heard in the street except the footsteps approaching and retiring the measured tread of two people occupied with each other going now more slowly now more quickly as the humour seized them or as their conversation grew in interest even the sound of their voices came by times to the auditorsbarbara's with an occasional laugh or tone of triumph and the other deeper with which rose had but little acquaintance but which was perfectly known to lucilla
all this time while her companion sat panting in the dark corner miss marjoribanks was looking to the joints of her harness and feeling the edge of her weapons
for after all it was no small enterprise upon which she was going forth
she was going to denounce the faithless knight to his face and take him out of the hands of the enchantress but then she herself meant to take him in hand and show him his true dangers and vindicate his honour
a more disinterested enterprise was never undertaken by any knighterrant
yet at the same time lucilla could not help entertaining a certain involuntary contempt for the man who had deserted her own standard to put himself under that of barbara lake and who was being paraded up and down here without knowing it to gratify the vanity of his new sovereign and make an exhibition of his weakness
lucilla would have been more than mortal if she had not felt the difference between her own rule which would have been all to his good and the purely egotistical sway of barbara and even in her magnanimous mind it was impossible that pity itself should not be mingled with a certain disdain
she sat quite still for so long that barbara grew intoxicated with her triumph
it is perhaps the last time lucilla said to herself with a movement of compassion and the breadth of her human sympathy was such that she waited till the very latest moment and let the deluded young woman have the full enjoyment of her imaginary victory
then miss marjoribanks rose with a certain solemnity and put on her hat and gave an unappreciated kiss to rose who kept in her corner
goodnight i am going said lucilla
the words were simple enough but yet they rang in rose's ears like the signal of a conspiracy
when the calm leader of the expedition went forth sensible of the importance of her mission but tranquil as great minds always are in a moment of danger rose got up too and followed trembling in every limb
she was capable of having thrown herself upon the spears in her own person in a sudden lan of indignation and passion but she was not capable of waiting till the right moment and meeting her antagonists in reasonable combat
miss marjoribanks went out deliberately without any unnecessary haste sweeping into the dusky twilight with her virginal white draperies
it was a very ordinary scene and yet even in the midst of her excitement rose could not help observing involuntarily its pictorial qualitiesif only any painter could have transferred to his canvas the subdued musical hum of surrounding life the fragrance of the mignonette and the peaceful stillness of the summer night
the sky shone out greenblue lambent and wistful from the vacant space between miss hemmings's and mr wrangle's and there were the dusky twilight shadows below and the yellow gleam of the lamp and barbara's exulting triumphant figure and the white robes of the avenging angel
rose could not have observed all this if she had not been stilled into a kind of breathless awe by the solemn character of the situation which struck her as being somehow like one of millais's pictures
as for the lovers they had just turned at the moment that miss marjoribanks came out and consequently met her straight in the face as she stood suave and smiling at the little garden door
it is mr cavendish said lucilla i am so glad i have been hoping and trying to see you for ever so long and as soon as ever i heard you talking i felt sure it was your voice
this was the greeting she addressed to barbara lake's lover
for his part he stood before her growing red and growing pale struck dumb by the unlookedfor meeting and with such a sense of being ashamed of himself as never before had entered his mind though no doubt he had done worse actions in his day
even barbara had not calculated upon this open encounter and instead of giving him any assistance as was a woman's duty in such a case she only tossed her head and giggled with an embarrassment which was more pride than shame
as for mr cavendish he would have liked to disappear under the pavement if it had been possible
for once he and rose were agreed
if a gulf had opened before him he would have jumped into it without ever pausing to ask himself why
and yet all the time miss marjoribanks was looking as placid as if she had been in her own drawingroom and expecting his reply to her friendly observations
when he realised that he ought to say something mr cavendish felt that he had as much need to wipe his forehead as ever the archdeacon had
he turned hot and cold and felt his mind and his tongue frozen and could not find a word to say
with a sudden horror he woke up like one of comus's revellers and found himself changed into the likeness of the creature he consorted with
if he had found an ass's head on his shoulders he could not have felt more startled and horrified than when he heard himself in the imbecility of the moment giggle like barbara and answer to lucilla's remark oh
yes it was my voice
i am very sorry to separate you from barbara said miss marjoribanks but she is at home you know and i want so much to talk to you
barbara goodnight i want mr cavendish to walk home with me
rose don't stand in the garden and catch cold thank you dear for such a pleasant evening said lucilla pressing another kiss upon her little friend's unwilling cheek
when she had done this she put out her hand to barbara and passed her sweeping her white garments through the narrow gateway
she took mr cavendish's arm as if he had been a young brother come to fetch her
let us go round by the chapel said miss marjoribanks i have so much to say to you
be sure to practise for thursday barbara and bid your papa goodnight for me
this was how she carried off mr cavendish finally out of barbara's very fingers and under her very eyes
when the two sisters were left standing together at the door they could do nothing but stare at each other in the extremity of their amazement
rose for her part remained but a moment and then feeling by far the guiltiest and most miserable of the whole party ran upstairs to her own room and cried as if her heart would break
barbara on the contrary who was past crying stood still at the door and watched lucilla's white dress disappearing on the way to grange lane with indescribable emotions
a young woman cannot call the police or appeal to the crier when it is her lover whom she has lost but to see him carried off by the strong handto watch him gradually going away and disappearing from her eyesto hear his steps withdrawing into the distancewas such a trial as few are called upon to bear
she stood and looked after him and could not believe her eyes
and then it was all so suddenan affair of a moment
barbara could not realise how the world had turned round and this revolution had been effectedone minute she had been leaning on his arm triumphant making a show and exhibition of him in the pride of her heart though he did not know it and the next was not she standing here watching him with a blank countenance and a despairing heart while lucilla had pounced upon him and carried him off in her cruel grasp
the blow was so sudden that barbara stood speechless and motionless till the two departing figures had vanished in the darkness
would he come back again tomorrow or was he gone for ever and ever
such were the thoughts of the forsaken maiden as she stood paralysed under this sudden change of fortune at her father's door
if some cruel spectator had thrown into the fire that brussels veil with which her imagination had so long played and barbara had stood heartstruck watching the filmy tissue dissolve into ashes before her eyes her sense of sudden anguish could not have been more acute
yet after all barbara's pangs were nothing to those of mr cavendish as he felt miss marjoribanks's light touch on his arm and felt his doomed feet turn in spite of himself in the most dangerous direction and became conscious that he was being led beyond all possibility of resistance back to grange lane and to his fate
to be sure it was dark which was one consolation but it was not dark enough to conceal lucilla's white dress nor the wellknown form and lineaments of the young monarch of grange lane in whose company nobody could pass unobserved
mr cavendish could have faced danger by sea and land with the average amount of courage but the danger of the walk down the little street which afterwards led to st roque's and up the embowered stillness of grange lane was more than he was equal to
he could not be sure of making a single step by these gardenwalls without meeting somebody who knew himsomebody whose curiosity might ruin him in carlingford or even without the risk of encountering in the face of that archenemy who would not go away and whose presence had banished him from the place
it may be supposed that under these terrible circumstances mr cavendish's thoughts of barbara who had got him into this scrape were far from loverlike
he was a man universally popular among ladies and who owed a great deal of the social consideration which he prized so highly to this fact and yet the most gentle sentiment in his mind at that moment was a confound these women
which he breathed to himself all low and deep as he went slowly along by lucilla's side
as for miss marjoribanks her thoughts were of a very much more serious description than anything her unlucky escort was thinking of and a minute or two passed in silence before she could make up her mind to speak
i have been thinking a great deal about you lately and wishing very much to see you said lucilla
did not mrs woodburn tell youi think i should have written to you had i known your address
and i am sure you would have made me the happiest of men said the victim with rueful politeness
what had i done to deserve such a privilege
but my sister did not tell me she left me to hear it from your own  yes said miss marjoribanks with a certain solemnity interrupting him i have been thinking a great dealand hearing a great deal about you mr cavendish
when she had said this lucilla sighed and her sigh found a terrible echo in her hearer's bosom
she knew that he turned green in the darkness as he gave an anxious look at her
but he was too much alarmed to give her an opportunity of studying his face
hearing of me he said and tried to laugh what have my kind friends been saying
and for one moment the sufferer tried to delude himself that it was some innocent gossip about barbara which might be circulating in grange lane
hush said lucilla don't laugh please for i want to have a very serious talk
i have been hearing about you from some very very old friends mr cavendishnot anything about this you know miss marjoribanks added waving her hand in the direction of grove street
and then barbara lake and everything connected with her vanished like a shadow from the unfortunate man's mind
it was horribly ungrateful on his part but it was as miss marjoribanks would have said just what might have been expected and how they always behave
he had no longer any time or patience for the object which had been giving occupation and interest to his solitude
he woke up in a moment and gave a passing curse to his folly and faced the real danger as he best could
you must be making a mistake miss marjoribanks he said with some bitterness it should have been very very old enemy
i know who it is
it is that archdeacon you ladies make such a fuss about
it is he who has been telling lies about me said mr cavendish
he breathed a deep hard breath as he spoke and the blood came back to his face
perhaps for the first moment he felt satisfied and breathed freer after it was over but at the same time it was very dreadful to him to feel that he was found out and that henceforth grange lane would shut its doors and avert its countenance
if you take his word for it i may give in at once he continued bitterly
a parson will say anything they are as bad asas women
this the poor man said in his despair because he did not know what he was saying for in reality he knew that women had been his best friends and that he had still a chance if the judgment was to rest with them
you are very ungrateful to say so said miss marjoribanks but it is only because you are excited i suppose
no mr cavendish it was not the archdeacon on the contrary it was a lady and she said nothing but good of you said lucilla and then there was a pause
as for mr cavendish it would be altogether impossible to describe the state of his mind
he was like a man suddenly reprieved but giddy with the shock and feeling the halter still round his neck and knowing that he had himself undermined the ground on which he was standing
it was lucilla who supported him in the shock of the moment for all his selfcommand could not keep him from a momentary shiver and stagger when he found that things were not so bad as he thought
a lady and she said nothing but good
he muttered under his breath and then he made an effort to recover himself
pardon me i cannot guess who my unknown friend may be
it is very soothing to one's feelings to be spoken well of by a lady said mr cavendish and he laughed again in a discordant unsteady way
lucilla regarded him through all these fluctuations with natural pity and at the same time with the calmness of a knowledge which was aware of all and had nothing more to discover and at the end mr cavendish perceived her calm and the absence of wonder and curiosity in her face and began to perceive that he had something very serious to deal withmore serious even than he had at first supposed
i am going to tell you all about it said miss marjoribanks but in the meantime wait a minute and let me speak to you
i have something very serious to say
it was for this they stopped short at the foot of grange lane just where the land was already parcelled out for st roque's
what lucilla was going to say was too important to be spoken while walking and she withdrew her hand from mr cavendish's arm
they were both so much absorbed that they did not see anybody coming nor indeed had any attention to spare for external affairs
the blood had deserted mr cavendish's face and he was once more green with anxiety and inquietude
he stood facing her feeling that the crisis of his fate had come and not knowing whether it was absolute despair or a faint dawning of hope that possessed him
if he had been the most passionate of lovers and if she had held in her hands the dreadful alternative between rapture and misery there could not have been a more rapt and absorbing attention in mr cavendish's face
i want to tell you first of all that you must have confidence in me said lucilla youmusthave confidence in me
we can do nothing without that
i know everything mr cavendish miss marjoribanks added compassionatelyeverything but nobody else knows it
i hope i can arrange everything if it is left in my hands
this is what i wanted to tell you first of all
before everything you must have confidence in me
what mr cavendish might have answered to this solemn appeal it would be vain to imagine for the truth was he was stopped before he could utter a word
he was stopped and seized by the hand and greeted with a frankness which was perhaps all the more loud and cordial from what appeared to the newcomer the comic character of the situation
it is cavendish by jove
the intruder exclaimed waving his hand to some people who were coming on behind him
i beg a thousand pardons for disturbing you my dear fellow but they all talk about you so that i was determined to make sure it was you
good heavens miss marjoribanks
general travers added taking off his hat
it was mr and mrs centum who were coming down behind himshe with a light shawl thrown over her head tempted out by the beauty of the evening and lucilla saw in a moment the consequences of this encounter and how it would be over all carlingford before tomorrow morning that she and mr cavendish were betrothed at the very least
miss marjoribanks had all her wits about her as ever fortunately for both
yes it is me she said calmly i have been taking tea with the lakes and i made mr cavendish give me his arm home
he did not like being found out to be sure but he could not help himself and we all know about that lucilla added with a smile taking once more the unfortunate man's arm
oh yes we all know said mrs centum with a laugh but yet notwithstanding everybody felt sure that it was all lucilla's cleverness and that barbara lake was a myth and fiction
and it was thus with miss marjoribanks leaning on his arm and general travers in all the warmth of renewed friendship guarding him on the other side that mr cavendish whose head was in a whirl of excitement and who did not know what he was doing was led back in triumph past colonel chiley's very door where the archdeacon was lying in wait to crunch his bones back from all his aberrations into the very heart of grange lane
chapter xxix   mr cavendish was led back to his own house that evening by general travers whose claim of acquaintance was too decided to be rejected
he never knew very well what passed between the moment when miss marjoribanks began to expound to him the urgent necessity that he should confide in her and the moment in which he found himself in his own house admitted eagerly by the surprised and anxious servants and conducted by the energetic soldier
that he had taken leave of lucilla at her own door that he had watched her white dress sweep away into the dark garden with a faint sense that it was his only remaining protector who thus left him and that after that he had smoked a horrible cigar with mr centum and been accompanied home by the old acquaintance who had turned up at so unlucky a momentwas all that the poor man was aware of
and yet it is to be supposed that on the whole he behaved himself very much like other people since general travers had no distinct idea that his company was undesirable or that his cordial recognition was anything but welcome
the general indeed took it as quite natural under the circumstances that cavendish should be a little confused
a man who is no longer a very young man and has a character to support does not care to be found mooning with the object of his affections on a summer evening like a boy of twenty and general travers was perfectly aware that he had thus a very good joke against cavendish
it is worth a man's while to set up a bachelor establishment in the country the general said
by jove
i wish i could do it
it makes a fellow feel arcadian and ready for anything and for his own part he was very ready to seize upon his former acquaintance a man who belonged to his club and had a chance to know what he was talking about
as for charlie centum the soldier said what between business and matrimony he has grown the greatest guy imaginable and i can't go off directly you know and then there's always this business about the depot
it's immense luck to find you here cavendish general travers added with flattering cordiality and if poor mr cavendish was not grateful it certainly was not his friend's fault
he led the way into his house with a glum countenance and a sinking heart though fortunately the latter was not visible
it was a very nice house fitted up with all that luxury of comfort which a man who has as mrs centum said only himself to look to can afford to collect around him
mr cavendish had only himself and he had made his habitation perfect though on the whole he did not pass a very great deal of his time at home
he had some nice pictures and a good library though he was not particularly given to the arts and he had an admirable cellar as all the gentlemen owned in carlingford though for his own part he was very moderate in that point and did not give himself any airs on the subject
mr centum on the contrary was one of the men who talk about vintages and raise expectations never to be carried out
and general travers could not but feel the force of the contrast as he sat deep into the night and talked over everything with the man who by that time he felt convinced was one of his best friends
as for mr cavendish it would be very difficult to describe his feelings
he had been knocking about in all sorts of poor places making clandestine visits to his sister and hovering round the more than suburban simplicity of grove street and the sense of being once more enveloped and surrounded by all that was pleasant to the eye and comfortable to the outer man was wonderfully consolatory and agreeable
but his mind was in a dreadfully harassed condition all the same
he was preoccupied to the last degree wondering what miss marjoribanks really knew and how far he had betrayed himself and to what extent it would be safe as she herself said to confide in lucilla and at the same time he was obliged to listen to and show a certain interest in the general's stories and to make now and then a painful effort of mind to recall some of the mutual friends referred to whose names and persons had in the meantime slipped out of his memory
all the babble of the club which general travers felt must be so refreshing to the ears of a rusticated member fell as flat upon mr cavendish whose mind was full of other matters as if it had been the merest old woman's gossip which to be sure it slightly resembled in some points
the gallant general made himself so agreeable that he nearly drove the unfortunate man out of his senses and when he had exhausted all other means of aggravation returned with fresh zest to the sentimental circumstances in which as he supposed he had found his companion out
very sensible i call it said general travers
to be candid i don't call her strictly handsome you know she's too big for thatand i don't suppose she's of any family to speak of though perhaps you don't mind that trifling circumstance but a woman that will dress well and light up well and knows how to give a man a capital dinner by jove
and no doubt has a pretty little bit of money into the bargaini respect your taste cavendish said the friendly critic with effusion and somehow this applause irritated its recipient more than all that had gone before
i am sure i am much obliged to you said mr cavendish though unfortunately i don't merit your approbation
miss marjoribanks is a great friend of mine but she wouldn't have me and i don't mean to ask her
at the same time she has very good connections and that is not the way to talk of a girl of twenty
she is worth a dozen of your fast young ladies said the sufferer with some heat
he was not in the least in love with lucilla and indeed had a certain dread of her at this present moment but he could not forget that she had once stood by him in his needand besides he was glad of any subject on which he could contradict his visitor
i dare say her family is better than either yours or mine
scotch you know said mr cavendish trying to laugh
as for the general he leaned back on his chair with an indulgent air and stroked his mustache
beg your pardonmeant no offence he said
for my part i don't see that it matters if a woman is goodlooking and has something you know
for instance there was a pretty little thinga charming little thinglake or something like that  ah
said mr cavendish
it was a frightful want of selfcontrol but he had been a long time at full strain and he could not help it
it did not occur to him for the moment that nobody in his senses would have applied the term little thing to barbara and after all the slow aggravation that he had been submitting to the idea of this insolent soldier interfering in grove street was beyond his power of endurance
as for the general the tone of this exclamation was such that he too turned round on his chair and said yes
with equally unmistakable meaning startled but ready for the emergency whatever it might be
thus the two looked at each other for a second friends in the ordinary acceptation of the word and yet perhaps on the eve of becoming enemies
mr cavendish had up to that moment pretty nearly forgotten barbara lake
it was a piquant sort of occupation when he had nothing else to do and when the world according to his morbid fancy was on the eve of turning its back upon himbut from the moment when he had said between his teeth confound these women
and had felt the excitement of the approaching crisis barbara and her crimson cheeks and her level eyebrows and her contralto had gone altogether out of his mind
at the same time it is quite true that a man may feel himself at liberty to forget a woman when other matters of more immediate interest are absorbing his attention and yet be driven furious by the idea suddenly presented to him that somebody else who has nothing earthly to do with it is about to interfere
mr cavendish however recovered himself while the general sat staring at him and began to see how ridiculous his defiance was
wellgo on
i did not say anything he said and lighted another cigar
yet he did not face his companion as a friendly listener should but began to beat measure to an irritating imaginary air on the table with a certain savage energy by moments as if he were beating time on the general's head
then why do you stop a fellow short like that
said general travers i was going to tell you of some one i saw the other day in the house of youryour friend you know
she was under miss marjoribanks's wing that was how i saw herand i hope you are not playing the gay deceiver my frienda little thing roundfaced hazeleyeda little soft rosebud sort of creature said the general growing eloquent
by jove
cavendish i hope you don't mean to make yourself disagreeable
these sort of looks you know  it was rose i suppose said mr cavendish relieved in a moment and to tell the truth he could not help laughing
the more eloquent and angry the general grew the more amused and contemptuous grew his entertainer
he was so tickled by the position of affairs that he actually forgot his anxieties for the moment
no doubt it was rose he repeated and laughed rose
what anybody could see in that little dragon
and then the contrast between the soldier who prided himself on his knowledge of the world and liked to talk of his family and position to the annoyance of those who had none and the amusement of those who happen to possess these valuable qualificationsand the mistress of the female school of design filled mr cavendish with amusement perhaps all the more because he himself was in a similar scrape
as for general travers he was as much disposed to be angry as a moment before mr cavendish had been
it might be rose he said or lily either for anything i can tell but there is nothing laughable in it that i can see
you seem to be perfectly au courant at all eventswhich i hope is quite satisfactory to miss marjoribanks said the soldier and then he resumed after a disagreeable little pause they tell me that everybody meets at the doctor's on thursdays
i suppose i shall see you there
thursday ain't it
tomorrow
he looked as he spoke with what seemed to his victim an insulting consciousness in poor cavendish's face
but in reality the general did not mean to be insulting and knew nothing whatever of the horrible internal pang which rent his companion when it was thus recalled to him that it was tomorrowa fact which up to this moment had not occurred to the unfortunate
tomorrow and not even tomorrowtodayfor by this time it was two o'clock in the morning and the unwelcome intruder was wasting the little time he had for deciding what he should do
once more his own personal anxieties which he had put aside for a moment at the sudden dictate of jealousy surged over everything and swallowed up all lesser sensations
tomorrowand by this time everybody knew that he was in carlingford and he could not stay away from the weekly assembly without attracting general attention to himself and throwing open the floodgates of suspicion
what was he to do
should he turn his back on the enemy once for all and run away and break off his connection with carlingford
or should he dare everything and face the archdeacon and put his trust in lucilla as that highminded young woman had invited him to do
with these thoughts in his mind it may be supposed that mr cavendish gave but a very mingled attention to the babble of his visitor who found the wine and the cigars so good and perhaps had begun to be a little moved out of his ordinary lucidity by their effect
you've got a nice little house cavendish said the general but it's too small for a married man my boy
these women are the very deuce for turning a man out of his comfortable quarters
you'll have to go in for boudoirs and those sort of things and by george
you'll be an ass if you do with a snug little box like this to retire into said the philosophical warrior and poor cavendish smiled a ghastly smile with the strongest inclination all the time to take him by the collar and turn him out of doors
but then he was a warrior and a general officer and a member of the same club and six feet highall which particulars not to speak of the sacred rights of hospitality made it somewhat difficult to carry this idea out
don't you think centum will be sitting up for you
he said mildly it's past two o'clock and it's thursday morning the victim added with a sigh
the last words were an involuntary utterance of his own despair but fortunately they struck general travers's vein of humour which happened to be lively at the moment and worked the desired but unexpected result
the general laughed loud and long and declared that he respected a man who was aboveboard and meant to look respectable for miss marjoribanks's sake and then he poured a mighty libation to lucilla and took an affectionate leave of her supposed lover
the general made a great commotion in the decorous quiet of grange lane when he knocked at mr centum's door
though it was nearly three o'clock in the morning nothing but his inherent dread of a woman would have prevented him from knocking up the banker to share his hilarity but mrs centum in her nightcap peaceably asleep as she was at the moment daunted the soul of the gallant soldier and naturally his recollection was not very perfect next day
i had something very funny to tell you but by jove
i forget what it was
general travers said next morning when he met his host at breakfast and thus one bad joke at least was spared
but mr cavendish shut his door upon his departing guest without any sense poor fellow of having done or said anything in the least funny
he said thank heaven
with a kind of groan of relief when his troublesome visitor was gone
and then he went back again into his library where they had been sitting
perhaps he had never fully appreciated before the comfort of everything the handsome house which he had enjoyed so long without thinking anything of it and all the pleasant luxurious accessories of life
he had been doing without them for a week or two and he had not liked it and yet at that moment it seemed to mr cavendish that he could rather be content to lose them all at a stroke to make it known in carlingford that he was ruined and had lost his fortune than that carlingford should find out that he was not after all one of the cavendishes nor the person it took him for
but alas
all his fortune could not bring reality to these pretensions nor hinder the exposure to which he looked forward with such horror
it is true that he was an adventurer but he was not a base one nor had he done anything dishonourable either to gain his fortune or to captivate the good opinion of society which had become so important to him
but there are actual crimes that would be sooner forgiven to a man than the folly of having permitted himself to be considered one of the cavendishes and having set his heart on making a figure in that mild provincial world
mr cavendish knew enough of human nature to know that a duchess or a lordchamberlain would forgive more readily than mr and mrs centum any such imposition upon them and intrusion into their exclusive circle
and then his sister who could not run away
for her sake it seemed to him that he had better rush off at once and sell his house and furniture and horses and give up carlingford
as he thought of that all the advantages of carlingford came upon him stronger than ever
perhaps a man who has always been used to be recognised as one of the members of a local aristocracy would not have seen anything half so precious as mr cavendish saw in the fact of being everywhere known and acknowledged as a constituent part of grange lanerecognised by the county people and by the poor people and pointed out as he passed by one and another to any stranger who might happen to be so ignorant as not to know mr cavendish
to people who are not used to it there is a charm in this universal acknowledgment
and then he had more need of it than most men have and when carlingford signed his patent of gentility and acknowledged and prized him it did an infinite deal more than it had any intention of doing
to keep its regard and recognition he would have done anything given up the half or three parts or even on emergency all he had
perhaps he had an undue confidence in the magnanimity of society and was too sure that in such a case it would behave with a grandeur worthy of the occasion but still he was quite right in thinking that it could forgive the loss of his fortune sooner than his real offence
and now it was thursday morning the day upon which he must either fight or flee
he too had laughed at miss marjoribanks's evenings in his time and thought of thursday lightly as lucilla's day but there was nothing in the least amusing in the prospect of that assembly now
when a man has thoughts like these to entertain him nothing can be more useless than to go to bed although in ordinary circumstances at three o'clock in the morning that is about the only thing one can do
poor mr cavendish however was not quite free to act as he thought proper
he had been a long time away from home and he did not feel himself in a position to shock his servants' feelings with impunity
he went to his room accordingly like a martyr carrying all his difficulties with him and these unpleasant companions naturally made a night of it when they had him all to themselves
when sheer fatigue and exhaustion procured him a moment's sleep it was only getting deeper and deeper into trouble for then it was the archdeacon who had planted a heavy foot on his neck or general travers who with still more fatal force had found out the way to grove street
when mr cavendish awoke he said to himself confound these women
with more fervour than ever but at the same time he swore a mighty oath to himself that he would horsewhip the fellow who ventured to come in his way
barbara lake might be no great things but at least it was to him and no one else that she belonged
such was the complication that afforded him a little outlet for his temper in the midst of the dreadful difficulties of his position and the question which was constantly renewing itself in his thoughts as to whether he should go or stay
the idea of presenting himself in the centre of society in miss marjoribanks's drawingroom and being met by the archdeacon and held up to public contempt there and then with all the world looking on and even travers who would carry the narrative out of carlingford was something too horrible to be contemplated and yet how was he to escape
he was still in this state of mind driven backwards and forwards by every new wind when the morning came and when miss marjoribanks's note was put into his hand
for the truth was that after long consideration lucilla had determined that the matter was one which could not be permitted to stand over
she was of too energetic a temperament to let things linger on in an uncertain way when they could be made an end of and brought to a conclusion and then as nobody can predict what sudden and unexpected turn human affairs may take it was always possible that if miss marjoribanks did not make an end of the business dramatically and to the satisfaction of everybody concerned it might be found some fine day to have resolved itself by means of some one of those illegitimate and incomplete expedients which abound in ordinary life
it was with this view that miss marjoribanks took the step of writing to mr cavendish
she had written in the sacred retirement of her own maiden chamber when all the world was still perhaps at the moment when general travers was as he would himself have vulgarly called it chaffing cavendish about the beautiful and disinterested friendship which united him to the young sovereign of grange lane
but naturally such poor raillery was far from the virginal thoughts of lucilla at that retired and sacred hour and we may venture to add that the elevating influence of the maiden's bower in which she composed it and of that tranquil moment of meditation and solitude breathed in every line and gave force to every sentiment of the letter which mr cavendish tore open with an excited hand
perhaps he was too anxious and curious to give it the solemn perusal which it ought to have received
my dear mr cavendishit was very unlucky that we should have      been interrupted this evening at such an important moment when i      had so much to say to you
but i think the best thing i can do is      to write feeling quite sure that when you know all you cannot      possibly mistake my motives
everybody has retired and i am quite      alone and the silence seems to me full of meaning when i think      that the fate of a person for whom i have so great a regard may be      hanging upon it
i might be afraid of writing to you so frankly if      i did not feel quite sure that you would appreciate my intention
dear mr cavendish it is not the archdeacon who has said anything
he does not know it is you therefore of course he could not      say anything directly bearing upon you
but then you know if he      were to meet you by hazard as he is sure to do some dayand for      my part i rather think he is fond of grove streetyou would be      exposed at once and everything would be lost for we all know the      prejudices that exist in carlingford
i have another plan of      operations to propose to you which i feel quite sure is for your      good and also naturally for the good of anybody to whom you may      intend to unite your fortunes
i feel quite sure that it is far      safer to adopt a bold resolution and to have it over at once
come      to dinner tomorrow
if you may happen to find an enemy you will      find also an unlookedfor friend and so far as i am concerned      you know that you may calculate on my support
i do not wonder at      your being anxious about it but if you will only have full      confidence in me and a little in yourself believe me it will be      all over in a night
if there had ever been anything between you      and me as these stupid people suppose i might have felt      hesitation in writing to you like this but when i know a thing to      be right i hope i will never be afraid to do it
i have been      called upon to do many things that are not common for girls of my      age and perhaps that is why i made up my mind at once to set this      all straight for you
once more i repeat dear mr cavendish have      confidence in me
come tomorrow evening as if nothing had      happened and take my word for it that all will go wellyour      friend       lucilla marjoribanks
psif you would like to come and talk it over with me      tomorrow i shall be at home till twelve o'clock but unless it      will be a satisfaction to your own mind it is not necessary for      me for i have all my plans laid
footnote  it is only justice to miss marjoribanks to say that she was not addicted to fine writing but then she was a person who liked to have everything in keeping and naturally an emergency such as the present does not come every day and requires to be treated accordingly
                              it would be quite out of the question to attempt any explanation of mr cavendish's feelings when he read this letter
his utter bewilderment his terror his rage his final helpless sense that it would be utterly hopeless for him or half a dozen men to enter the field against this curious complication of unknown friends and open enemies and generous protectors took away from him the last remnant of courage
he did not know what to do or to think
he swallowed his coffee with a sense of despair and sent the rest of his breakfast away untasted thus betraying without intending it his emotions to his kitchen
it stands to reason as there's a cause for it mr cavendish's domestics concluded in committee of the whole house and surely if ever man had good reason for not eating his breakfast it was he
when he had gone over it all again till his head had grown utterly confused and his thoughts were all topsyturvy mr cavendish took a sudden resolution
he went upstairs and changed his dress with a certain solemnity
he made a toilette more careful than if he were going as he once had gone to propose
it was like nelson going into gala uniform for a battle
and then he went out to discover if possible what was coming to him
the difference was that in this battle no honour but only a possible salvage of reputation and fortunate escape was to be gained
chapter xxx   it is possible that some people may think mr cavendish's emotions too acute for all the danger to which he was exposed but no doubt every alarm gets intensified when a man broods on it and thinks of nothing else for weeks at a time
all that he had to do at the present moment was to walk into carlingford by the most frequented way and to go up grange lane where every house was open to him and where nobody was so great a favourite as he
there were as many chances in his favour that he would not in that friendly neighbourhood encounter his one enemy as there is for every man who goes into action that the bullet which is predestined to strike somebody will not be directed to him but then mr cavendish had not the excitement of personal conflict nor the kind of security which is given by sharing a risk with a great many other people
and to see everything smiling and serene around and yet to know that the most deadly danger may arrive to you at any innocent opening or round the first streetcorner is a kind of risk which naturally tells upon the nerves more than a more open peril
mr cavendish met dr marjoribanks and the doctor was good enough to stop his brougham and keep him in conversation for five minutes with his back to the foe if foe there was approaching and then he met mrs chiley who all but kissed him and was so glad to see him again and so pleased that he was in time to make acquaintance with the archdeacon and so sure that lucilla would be quite happy now he had come back
perhaps i ought not to say so but i know she has missed you said the injudicious old lady and she took both his hands and held the miserable man in a kind of pillory from whence he gazed with despairing eyes over her shoulder feeling sure that now was the fatal moment and that his enemy must be coming
but fortune still favoured him as it happened
he had the presence of mind to say i am going to call on miss marjoribanks and mrs chiley dropped his hands on the instant as if they burned her and patted him on the arm and sent him away
she is sure to be in just now and i am so glad and my dear you need not mind me for i am both your friends mrs chiley said
but when he was delivered from that danger something still more formidable awaited the unfortunate man
he could not believe his eyes at first nor conceive it possible that fate would have such a spite against him but there was no mistaking the crumpled dress any more than the straight eyebrows and flashing oblique glances that had already found him out
of all the horrible chances in the world it was barbarabarbara who had a right to think he had deserted her on the previous night and with whom his next interview could not be otherwise than stormywho thus appeared like a lion in his way
when he saw what awaited him mr cavendish lost courage
his heart sank down into unfathomable depths
he did not know what he could say to her to shorten the inevitable interview nor how he could escape nor how hinder her from discovering that it was lucilla he was going to see and he had no longer any doubt in his mind that while he was thus engaged the archdeacon must inevitably appear
if he had had time to think of ordinary subjects he would have been sufficiently annoyed at the idea of an interview with barbara in broad daylight on the sacred soil of grange lane where all the world could or might be spectators but such a merely prudential sentiment was entirely swallowed up today in much more urgent considerations
he would have been content just now in the horror of the moment to plight his troth to barbara by way of getting rid of her and leaving his path clear but he could not stop her or himself from advancing and dared not give any vent to the panic which was consuming his soul
oh i am sure i never thought of seeing you here mr cavendish said barbara with a toss of her head
she would have done a great deal to secure her wavering lover but she could not be amiable at a moment when she had him at a disadvantage
perhaps you are going to see miss marjoribanks said the foolish young woman
to tell the truth she did not suspect him of any such treachery but her heart was beating louder than usual and she had the best position of the two or thought she had and chose what she supposed the most aggravating thing to say
but it is always hard to tell what a man may do when he is in a state of despair
mr cavendish looked her in the face with the composure of desperation though she did not know that
all that he was able to think of was how to get rid of her soonest and to be able to continue his way
yes i am going to see miss marjoribanks he said with a face which extremity rendered stolid and impassible
as for poor barbara her colour changed in a moment
the very least that she had a right to expect was that he should have asked her pardon put himself at her feet and her mingled spite and humiliation and mortification at this response were beyond telling
her cheeks blazed with sudden rage her passion was so furious that she actually did what he wanted and stood out of his way and made him an imperious sign to pass on and leave her
but even then she did not expect to be taken at her word
when mr cavendish took off his hat in that heartless way and passed on barbara stood aghast not able to believe her senses
had he really passed and left her she who had done so much for him
had he actually gone over to her adversary before her very eyes
she stood stockstill when he left her gazing after him blazing with rage and despite and scarcely able to keep herself from shrieking out the torrent of reproaches and vituperations that were in her mind
she made no attempt whatever to hide her wrath or jealous curiosity from any eyes that might be there to see but to be sure she had as her sister said no proper pride
if mr cavendish had carried out his intentions the chances are that barbara driven desperate would have rushed after him and found some means of breaking in upon his interview with lucilla but after all this badgering he had not the courage to carry out his intentions
he looked down the long sunshiny line of grange lane with a sickening sense that any of these doors might open at any moment and his fate rush out upon him
there was not a soul to be seen but that only made it all the more likely to poor mr cavendish's distempered fancy that somebody was coming
he had not even a single thought at leisure to give to barbara and never asked himself whether or not she was standing watching him
all his senses and faculties were engaged forecasting what might happen to him before he could reach dr marjoribanks's house
he was approaching it from the lower end of grange lane and consequently had everything to risk and when mr centum's door opened and all the nurses and all the children poured out the unfortunate man felt his heart jump and drop again if possible lower than ever
it was this that drove him instead of going on to lucilla to take refuge in his sister's house where the door happened to be open
he rushed in there and took breath and was safe for the instant
but barbara for her part watching him divined none of mr cavendish's reasons
her heart too gave a jump and her wrath cooled down miraculously
no doubt it was a little impatience at being questioned which had made him answer as he did
he had not gone to lucillahe had not deserted her standard who had always met him halfway and done so much for him
barbara calmed down as she saw him enter at mrs woodburn's door
after having thus witnessed his safe exit she felt at liberty to go back and return to her own affairs and prepare her toilette for the evening for it moved her very little less than mr cavendish to know that it was thursday and that there was no telling what might happen that night
as for the hero of all this commotion he went and buried himself in mrs woodburn's back drawingroom and threw himself on the sofa in the dark corner and wiped his forehead like the archdeacon
it was not his fault if events had overwhelmed him
if he had not met in succession dr marjoribanks and mrs chiley and barbara he would have gone right to lucilla without stopping to question himself furtherbut he could not bear all this accumulation
panic had seized upon him and this panic wrought more effectually than all argument
it was so terrible to live under such a shadow that he felt it must be put an end to
if only he were left at rest for this moment he felt that he could make up his mind to take the perilous leap at night and dare everything
it can't be worse than ruin he said to himself and tried not to think that for his sister it might be something even worse than ruin
but the first thing of all was to get a little rest in the meantime and hide himself and forget the nightmare that was seated on his shoulders
when mrs woodburn came to him in haste and saw his careful dress and pale looks she was frightened for the moment
she thought it possible for one second that despair had driven him out of his wits and that there might be for anything she could tell a little bottle of prussic acid in his waistcoat pocket
that was her first idea and her second was that he was going to carry out at last his most wise and laudable resolution of proposing to miss marjoribanks and that it was thisnaturally a serious and hazardous enterprisewhich made him look so pale
harry if you are going to lucilla
said mrs woodburn wait and rest yourself a little and i will get you a glass of wine
keep still there's some tokay said the anxious sister
don't you go and worry yourself
you shall see nobody
i'll bring it you with my own hand
oh confound the tokay
said mr cavendish
i know what woodburn's tokay isif that mattered
look here i want to speak to you
i was going to lucilla but i'm not up to it
oh not in the way you think
don't be a fool like everybody
i tell you she wouldn't have me and i won't ask her
read this which is much more to the purpose mr cavendish added taking out miss marjoribanks's letter
he watched her while she read it with that sense of contempt and superiority which a man naturally feels who has advanced much beyond the point in any special matter at which his interlocutor is still stationary
he even smiled at her cry of horror and amazement and found the agitation she showed ridiculous
don't make a row about it he said regaining his colour as his sister lost hers
it's all right
i can't ask lucilla marjoribanks to have me after that but i mean to put my trust in her as she says
i was going to ask her to explain but after all on thinking of it i don't see the good of explanations said mr cavendish with lofty tranquillity
the fact is she is right nelly and stand or fall we'll have it out tonight
but mrs woodburn was scarcely in a condition to reply much less to give any advice
oh good heavens
what does she know
cried the trembling woman
what do you suppose she can know
she gave me a dreadful fright coming and asking about you and your name
and then she never was a great friend of mineand if she should say anything to woodburn
oh harry go away go away and don't face her
you know you slighted her and she is laying a snare for us
oh harry go away
she can't do you much harm but she could ruin me and any little peace i have
woodburn would nevernever forgivehe would be frantic you know
it has always been he that made a fuss about the cavendishesand good heavens
to be in a girl's power and she one that you have slighted harry
oh for heaven's sake for pity's sake if you care anything for me  hold your tongue nelly said mr cavendish
don't make a row
what on earth is the use of heaven'ssaking
i tell you i am going to make an end of it
if i were to run away now it would turn up again at some other corner and some other moment
give me a pen and a bit of paper
i will write a note and say i am coming
i don't want any explanations
if it's all a mistake so much the better but i'm going to face it out tonight
it was some time before mrs woodburn recovered her senses but in the meantime her brother wrote lucilla his note and in sight of his sister's agitation felt himself perfectly composed and serene and manful
it even made him complaisant to feel the difference that there was when the emergency really arrived at last between his own manly calm and her womanish panic
but then it was for herself that she was afraid lest her husband should find out that she was not one of the cavendishes
you must have been giving yourself airs on the subject mr cavendish said as he fastened up his note
i never was so foolish as that for my part and naturally the more he admired his own steadiness and courage the steadier and more courageous he grewor at least so he felt for the moment with her terror before his eyes
if you do go said mrs woodburn at last oh harry for goodness' sake mind that you deny everything
if you confess to anything it will all be proved against you don't allow a single thing that's said to you
it is a mistaken identity you knowthat is what it is there was a case in the papers just the other day
oh harry for heaven's sake don't be weakdeny everything you don't know anything about ityou don't know what they meanyou can't understand  it is i that have to do it nelly said mr cavendish more and more tranquil and superior
you must let me do it my way and he was very kind and reassuring to her in his composure
this was how things ought to be and it was astonishing how much he gained in his own mind and estimation by mrs woodburn's panic
being the stronger vessel he was of course superior to all that
but somehow when he had got back to his own house again and had no longer the spectacle of his sister's terror before him the courage began to ooze out of mr cavendish's fingerpoints he tried hard to stimulate himself up to the same point and to regain that lofty and assured position but as the evening approached matters grew rather worse than better
he did not turn and flee because flight in the present alarmed and touchy state of public opinion would have equally been destruction and nobody could answer for it how far if he failed to obey her miss marjoribanks's discretion might go
and thus the eventful evening fell and the sun went down which was to mr cavendish as if it might be the last sun he should ever metaphorically seewhile in the meantime all the other people dressed for dinner as if nothing was going to happen and as if it was merely a thursday like other thursdays which was coming to grange lane
chapter xxxi   lucilla waited till twelve o'clock as she had said for mr cavendish's visit and so mingled are human sentiments even in the mind of a person of genius that there is no doubt she was at once a little disappointed and that mr cavendish gained largely in her estimation by not coming
her pity began to be mingled by a certain respect of which to tell the truth he was not worthy but then miss marjoribanks did not know that it was circumstances and not selfregard or any sense of dignity that had kept him back
with the truest consideration it was in the diningroom that lucilla had placed herself to await his visit for she had made up her mind that he should not be disturbed this time by any untimely morning caller
but as she sat at the window and looked out upon the garden and was tantalised by fifty successive ringings of the bell none of which heralded her expected visitor a gentler sentiment gradually grew in lucilla's mind
perhaps it would not be just to call it positively regret but yet she could not help a kind of impression that if the archdeacon had never come to carlingford and if mr cavendish had never been so weak as to be drawn aside by barbara lake and if everything had gone as might have been expected from first appearancesthat on the whole it might have been well
after all he had a great many good qualities
he had yielded to panic for the moment but so far as lucilla knew he was now girding up his loins to meet the emergency in a creditable way and if as has been just said nothing had come in the wayif there had been no archdeacon no mrs mortimer no barbaraif mr chiltern had died as was to have been expected and mr cavendish been elected for carlingfordthen lucilla could not help a momentary sense that the arrangement altogether might have been a not undesirable one
now of course all that was at an end
by dexterous management the crisis might be tided over and the worst avoided but lucilla became regretfully conscious that now no fate higher than barbara was possible for the unfortunate man who might once and with hope have aspired to herself
it was very sad but there was no help for it
a certain tenderness of compassion entered miss marjoribanks's bosom as she realised this change
it would be hard if a woman did not pity a man thus shut out by hard fate from any possibility of ever becoming the companion of her existencea man who on the whole had many capabilities yet whose highest fortune in life could not mount above barbara lake
this thought filled lucilla's heart with gentle regret
it was sad but it was inevitable and when mr cavendish's note was brought to her in which he said simply and very briefly that though not sure whether he understood the meaning of her letter he should certainly do himself the pleasure of accepting as usual her kind invitation miss marjoribanks's regret grew more and more profound
such a man who had been capable of appreciating herself to think that having known her he should decline upon barbara
the pity was entirely disinterested for nobody knew better than lucilla that under the circumstances no other arrangement was possible
he might marry the drawingmaster's daughter but miss marjoribanks was too well aware of her duty to her friends and to her position in society to have given her consent to his marriage with anybody's daughter in grange lane
but still it was a pitynobody could say that it was not a pitya man so visibly capable of better things
lucilla however could not afford to waste her morning in unprofitable regrets
an evening so critical and conclusive had to be provided for in many different ways
among other things she had to invite or rather command the presence of a guest whom to tell the truth she had no particular desire to see
the archdeacon was only a man when all was said and might change his mind like other men and to bring mrs mortimer to grange lane in the evening looking interesting as to be sure she could look by times after that unpleasant exhibition of dr marjoribanks's feelings was naturally a trial to lucilla
mr beverley had drawn back once before and that when mrs mortimer was young and no doubt a great deal more attractive than at present and now that she was a widow forlorn and faded it would be no wonder if he were to draw back especially as lucilla acknowledged to herself when he saw the ancient object of his affections in her own society and among all the fresh young faces of grange lane and if the archdeacon should draw back and leave the field open and perhaps the doctor who ought to know better should step inwhen she had got so far lucilla rose up and shook out her draperies as if by way of shaking off the disagreeable idea
at all events i have to do my duty she said to herself
and thus it was with that last and most exquisite refinement of welldoing the thought that she might possibly be going to harm herself in benefiting others that miss marjoribanks heroically put on her hat and issued forth in the dinnerhour of the little pupils to invite her last and most important guest
this period of suspense had not been by any means a happy or comfortable period for mrs mortimer
the poor widow was living in a constant expectation of something happening whereas her only true policy was to have made up her mind that nothing would ever happen and shaped herself accordingly to her life
instead of eating her dinner as she ought to have done at that hour of leisure and fortifying herself for the weary afternoon's work she was sitting as usual at the window when miss marjoribanks came to the door
and if it was a tedious business looking out of the window when the rain was drenching the four walls of the garden and breaking down the flowers and reducing all the poor little shrubs to abject misery it could not be said to be much more cheerful in the sunshine when pleasant sounds came in over that enclosurevoices and footsteps of people who might be called alive while this solitary woman was buried and had nothing to do with life
such a fate may be accepted when people make up their minds to it but when so far from making up one's mind one fixes one's thoughts upon the life outside and fancies that every moment the call may come and one may find one's place again in the active world the tedium grows more and more insupportable
as for lucilla naturally she could not see any reason why mrs mortimer should sit at the windowwhy she could not content herself and eat her dinner instead
there are a great many people in carlingford who have not nearly such a pleasant lookout lucilla said for my part i think it is a very pretty garden
the wistaria has grown quite nice and there is a little of everything said miss marjoribanks and so far as that went she was no doubt the best judge having done it all herself
oh yes it is very pretty and i am sure i am very grateful to providence for giving me such a home said the widow but she sighed poor soul as she said it for to tell the truth though she was not so young as she once was it takes some people a long time to find out that they themselves are growing old and have done with life
and then outside in that existence which she could hear but could not see there was one figure which was wonderfully interesting to poor mrs mortimer which is a complication which has a remarkable effect on the question of content or discontent
you ought to take a walk every day said miss marjoribanks that is what is the matter with you but in the meantime there is something else i want you to do
this is thursday you know and i have always some people on thursday
it is not a partyit is only an eveningand no dress to speak of
your black silk will look quite nice and be all that is necessary
black is very becoming to some people said lucilla reflectively
she looked at mrs mortimer with her head a little on one side and saw in a moment with the rapid glance of genius just what she wanted
and some lace for your head miss marjoribanks added
i don't think you have gone off at all and i am sure you will look very nice
it is at nine o'clock
this evening lucilla
said mrs mortimer faintly but you know i never go outi am not fit for society
oh don't ask me please
since poor edward died'  yes said lucilla it must have been a great loss i am sure though i can't say i mind going into a room alone as some people do but you know you can avoid that if you like by coming early
come at eight and there will be nobody in the drawingroom and you can choose your own corner
put it quite backat the back of your head said miss marjoribanks with a little anxiety
i could show you how if i had the lace
i do so want you to look nice
oh never mind the fashion
when one has a style of one's own it is always twenty times better
put it as you used to wear it before you were married and then with that nice black silk  oh lucilla don't ask me said the widow
i shall not know how to talk nor look nor anything and then i know nobody and then  my dear you have always me said lucilla with tender reproach
i am so sorry i can't stop any longer
i leave it quite to your own taste about the lace
and you will find people you know you may be quite sure of that
remember not later than nine o'clock and come at eight if you don't like to come into the room by yourself
goodbye now
i want you to look very nice tonight miss marjoribanks added giving her friend an affectionate kiss you must for my sake
but lucilla cried mrs mortimer
it was vain to make any further protest however for lucilla was gone having in the first place communicated her requirements to mary jane who was not likely to forget nor to let her mistress be late
and mind she is nice said miss marjoribanks emphatically as she went out at the door
it was necessary she should be nice without that the intended situation which lucilla was preparingthe grand finale of her exertionswould fall flat and probably fail of its effect
for this it was necessary that the widow should look not only pretty but interesting and a little pathetic and all that a widow should look when first dragged back into society
miss marjoribanks gave a momentary sigh as she emerged from the garden door and could not but feel conscious that in all this she might be preparing the most dread discomfiture and downfall for herself
even if it passed over as it ought to do and nobody was charmed but the archdeacon who was the right person to be charmed lucilla felt that after this she never could have that entire confidence in her father which she had had up to this moment
the incipient sentiment dr marjoribanks had exhibited was one that struck at the roots of all faith in him as a father and every person of sensibility will at once perceive how painful such a suggestion must have been to the mind of a young woman so entirely devoted as was miss marjoribanks to the consolation and comfort of her dear papa
lucilla was not allowed to spend the rest of this momentous afternoon in maturing her plans as might have been necessary to a lesser intelligence and when the refreshing moment came at which she could have her cup of tea before preparing for the fatigues of the evening it was mrs chiley who came to assist at that ceremony
the old lady came in with an important air and gave lucilla a long lingering kiss as old ladies sometimes do when they particularly mean it
my dear i am not going to stay a moment but i thought you might have something to tell me the kind old woman said arranging herself in her chair with the satisfaction of a listener who expects to be confided in
as for lucilla who had no clue to mrs chiley's special curiosity and who had a good many things on her mind just at that moment which she rather preferred not to talk about she was for once struck with veritable astonishment and did not know what to say
dear mrs chiley what should i have to tell you
said miss marjoribanks
you know very well where i should go the very first moment if anything happened and by way of staving off more particular questions she took her old friend a cup of tea
yes my dear i hope so said mrs chiley but at the same time her disappointment was evident
it is very nice thank youyour tea is always nice lucillabut it was not that i was thinking of
i can't understand how it is i am sure
i saw him today with my own eyes and could not help seeing how anxious he was looking
i hope i do hope you have not been so cruel as to refuse him lucillaand all for something that is not his fault poor fellow or that could be explained you may be sure
miss marjoribanks grew more and more surprised as she listened
she put away the kettle without filling the teapot and left her own cup standing untasted and went and sat down on the stool by mrs chiley's feet
tell me whom i have refused this time for i don't know anything about it said lucilla and then her visitor burst forth
it must be all that creature's fault
he told me he was coming here and to tell the truth i stood and watched him for you know how interested i am my dear and then a little while after he met that barbara
oh lucilla why were you ever so foolish as to have her here
i told you how it would end when you brought those artist people about your house
they are all a set of adventurers
cried mrs chiley
i saw them meet and i was so disgusted that i did not know what i was doing but he passed her as nicely as possible
just a civil word you know and then he was past
just as i would have done myself for it is always best not to be uncivil to anybody
i could see her standing as if she had been struck with lightning and naturally lucilla i never thought anything else than that he had come here and that all was right between you
oh my dear i hope you are sure you have not refused him mrs chiley said piteously anyhow lucilla you need not mind telling me
i may be sorry but i will not blame you my dear
i have not refused anybody said lucilla with a modest innocence that it was a pleasure to see but dear mrs chiley she continued raising her drooping eyelids i think you make a mistake about mr cavendish
my own opinion is that barbara would make him a very nice wife
oh please don't be angry
i don't mean to say you know that i think her quite what one would call nicefor oneself
but then the gentlemen have such strange ways of thinking
many a girl whom we could not put up with is quite popular with them said miss marjoribanks with a certain mild wonder at the inexplicable creatures whom she thus condescended to discuss
i suppose they have a different standard you know and for my part i would advise mr cavendish to marry barbara
i think it is the best thing he could do
lucilla
cried mrs chiley almost with a shriek of horror
she thought as was perhaps natural that there was some pique in what her young companion said not doing miss marjoribanks justiceas indeed few people didfor that perfect truthfulness which it was lucilla's luck always to be able to maintain
mrs chiley thought it was her young friend's maidenly pride and determination not to take up the part of a woman slighted or jilted
you may refuse him my dear if your heart is not with him said the old lady but i would not be so hard upon him as that poor fellow
you may say what you please but i always will think him nice lucilla
i know i ought to be on the archdeacon's side said mrs chiley putting her handkerchief to her eyes but i am an old woman and i like my old friends best
oh lucilla it is not kind of you to keep up appearances with me
i wish you would give way a little
it would do you good my darling and you know i might be both your grandmothers lucilla she cried putting her arm round her favourite
as for miss marjoribanks she gave her old friend a close embrace which was the only thing that even her genius could suggest to do
i have always you said lucilla with touching eloquence and then she freed herself a little from mrs chiley's arms
i don't say perhaps that everybody will receive her but i mean to make an effort for my part and i shall certainly tell mr cavendish so if he ever speaks of it to me
as for mr beverley he is going to be married too
did not you hear
he told me all about it himself one day said miss marjoribanks and i will ask him tonight if i may not tell you who the lady is
it is quite a little romance and i hope we shall have two marriages and it will make it quite gay for the winter
when you know all about it lucilla added tenderly by way of breaking the shock i am sure you will be pleased
but instead of being pleased mrs chiley was speechless for the moment
her fresh old cheeks grew ashy with dismay and horror
the archdeacon too
she cried gasping for breath
oh lucilla my dearand you
then the kind old lady held miss marjoribanks fast and sobbed over her in the despair of the moment
to think after all the pains that had been taken and all the hopes and all the speculations that neither the one nor the other was coming to anything
if it should be that general after alland i cannot abide him sobbed lucilla's anxious friend
but miss marjoribanks's genius carried her through this trial as well as through all the others which she had yet encountered on her way
dear mrs chiley
said lucilla it is so good of you to care but if it had been that i was thinking of i need never have come home at all you know and my object in life is just what it has always been to be a comfort to papa
upon which mrs chiley kissed her young friend once more with lingering meaning
my dear i don't know what they mean she said with indignation everybody knows men are great fools where women are concernedbut i never knew what idiots they were till now and you are too good for them my darling
said mrs chiley with indignant tenderness
perhaps miss marjoribanks was in some respects of the same way of thinking
she conducted her sympathetic friend to the garden door when it came to be time for everybody to go and dress with a certain pathetic elevation in her own person which was not out of accord with mrs chiley's virtuous wrath
to have mrs mortimer and barbara lake preferred to her did not wound lucilla's prideone can be wounded in that way only by one's equals
she thought of it with a certain mild pity and charitable contempt
both these two men had had the chance of having her and this was how they had chosen
and there can be little wonder if miss marjoribanks's compassion for them was mingled with a little friendly and condescending disdain
it was however an ease to lucilla's mind that she had let mrs chiley know and was so far free to work out her plans without any fear of misconception
and on the whole her old friend's tender indignation was not disagreeable to her
thus it was without any interval of repose to speak of that her lofty energies went on unwearied to overrule and guide the crisis which was to decide so many people's fate
chapter xxxii   dr marjoribanks was not a man to take very much notice of trivial external changes and he knew lucilla and her constitution and being a medical man was not perhaps so liable to parental anxieties as an unprofessional father might have been but even he was a little struck by miss marjoribanks's appearance when he came into the drawingroom
he said you are flushed lucilla
is anything going to happen
with the calmness of a man who knew there was not much the matterbut yet he did observe that her colour was not exactly what it always was
i am quite well papa thank you said lucilla which to be sure was a fact the doctor had never doubted and then the people began to come in and there was no more to be said
but there could be no doubt that lucilla had more colour than usual
her pulse was quite steady and her heart going on at its ordinary rate but her admirable circulation was nevertheless so far affected that the ordinary rosetints of her complexion were all deepened
it was not so distinctly an improvement as it would have been had she been habitually pale but still the flush was moderate and did miss marjoribanks no harm
and then it was a larger party than usual
the centums were there who were general travers's chaperons and so were the woodburns and of course mrs chiley which made up the number of ladies beyond what was general at dr marjoribanks's table
lucilla received all her guests with the sweetest smiles and all her ordinary ease and selfpossession but at the same time her mind was not free from some excitement
she was on the eve of a crisis which would be the greatest failure or the greatest success of her public life and naturally she anticipated it with a certain emotion
mr cavendish for his part had sufficient sense to come very early and to get into a dark corner and keep himself out of the way for though he was screwed up to the emergency his selfpossession was nothing to that of lucilla
but on the whole it was perhaps mrs woodburn who suffered the most
her heightened colour was more conspicuous than that of miss marjoribanks because as a general rule she was pale
she was pale almost white and had dark eyes and dark hair and possessed precisely all the accessories which make a sudden change of complexion remarkable and the effect this evening was so evident that even her husband admired her for a moment and then stopped short to inquire by george
had she begun to paint
to which question mrs woodburn naturally replied only by an indignant shrug of her white shoulders and aversion of her head
she would not have been sorry perhaps for this night only if he had believed that it was rouge and not emotion
of all the people at dr marjoribanks's table she perhaps was the only one really to be pitied
even mr cavendish if vanquished would at the most receive only the recompense of his deeds and could go away and begin over again somewhere else or bury himself in the great depths of general society where nobody would be the wiser but as for his sister she could not go away
the first result for her would be to give the master to whom she belonged and for whom she had with some affection a great deal of not unnatural contempt a cruel and overwhelming power over her and she knew poor soul that he was not at all too generous or delicate to make use of such a power
in such a case she would be bound to the rock like a kind of hapless andromeda to be pecked at by all the birds and blown at by all the winds not to speak of the devouring monster from whom no hero could ever deliver her and with all these horrible consequences before her eyes she had to sit still and look on and do nothing to see all the hidden meaning of every look and movement without appearing to see it to maintain ordinary conversation when her ear was strained to the uttermost to hear words of fate on which her whole future depended
no wonder her colour was high and she could not go into a corner as mr cavendish did nor keep silent nor withdraw herself from observation
neither her pulse nor her heart would have borne the scrutiny to which miss marjoribanks's calm organs might have been subjected with perfect security and the chances are if the doctor had by any hazard put his finger on her wrist when he shook hands with her that instead of handing her over to general travers to be taken down to dinner he would have on the contrary sent her off to bed
fortunately by this time the year was declining and that happy season had returned in which people once more begin to dine by artificial light and at the same time it was not absolutely dark in the drawingroom so that lucilla had not as she said thought it necessary to have the candles lighted
if there should happen to be a mistake as to who is to take down who it will only be all the more amusing said miss marjoribanks so long as you do not go off and leave me
this was addressed to the archdeacon to whom lucilla was very particular in her attentions at that moment
mrs chiley who was looking on with a great sense of depression could not help wondering whywhen she knows he is engaged and everything settled the old lady said to herself with natural indignation
for her part she did not see what right a man had to introduce himself thus under false pretences into the confiding bosom of societywhen he was as bad as married or even indeed worse
she was ruffled and she did not think it worth while to conceal that she was so for there are limits to human patience and a visitor who stays six weeks ought at least to have confidence in his entertainers
mrs chiley for once in her life could have boxed lucilla's ears for her uncalledfor civility
i think it very strange that it is not the general who takes her downstairs she said to mrs centum
it is all very well to have a respect for clergymen but after being here so often and the general quite a strangeri am surprised at lucilla said the indiscreet old lady
as for mrs centum she felt the neglect but she had too much proper pride to own that her man was not receiving due attention
it is not the first time general travers has been here she said reserving the question and so in the uncertain light when nobody was sure who was his neighbour the procession filed downstairs
to enter the diningroom all brilliant and shining as it was radiant with light and flowers and crystal and silver and everything that makes a dinnertable pretty to look upon was as mrs centum said quite a contrast
a close observer might have remarked as mrs woodburn and lucilla took their places that both of them instead of that flush which had been so noticeable a short time before had become quite pale
it was the moment of trial
poor mr cavendish in his excitement had taken just the place he ought not to have taken immediately under the lamp at the centre of the table
during the moment when the unsuspecting archdeacon said grace with his eyes decorously cast down miss marjoribanks owned the ordinary weakness of humanity so much as to drop her fan and her handkerchief and even the napkin which was arranged in a symmetrical pyramid on her plate
such a sign of human feebleness could but endear her to everybody who was aware of the momentous character of the crisis
when these were all happily recovered and everybody seated lucilla kept her eyes fixed upon the archdeacon's face
it was as we have said a terrible moment
when he raised his head and looked round him naturally mr beverley's eyes went direct to the mark like an arrow he looked and he saw at the centre of the table surrounded by every kind of regard and consideration full in the light of the lamp his favourite adventurer the impostor whom he had denounced the first time he took his place by miss marjoribanks's side
the archdeacon rose to his feet in the excitement of the discovery he put his hand over his eyes as if to clear them
he said good god
loud out with an accent of horror which paralysed the two people lower down than himself
as for miss marjoribanks she was not paralysedshe who had not lost a single glance of his eyes or movement of his large person
lucilla rose to the height of the position
she put her hand upon his arm sharply and with a certain energy
mr beverley thomas is behind you with the soup said miss marjoribanks
the archdeacon turned round to see what it was conscious that somebody had spoken to him but as indifferent to his companion and to civility as he was to thomas and the soup
what
he said hoarsely interrupting his scrutiny for the moment
but when he had met miss marjoribanks's eye the archdeacon sat down
lucilla did not liberate him for a moment from that gaze
she fixed her eyes upon his eyes and looked at him as people only look when they mean something
if you tell me what surprised you so much perhaps i can explain said miss marjoribanks
she spoke so that nobody could hear but himself and in the meantime general travers at her left hand was making himself excessively agreeable to mrs woodburn and no doubt occupying all her attention and lucilla never turned her eyes for a moment from the archdeacon's face
i beg your pardon said mr beverley
i was confounded by what i saw
good heavens
it is not possible i can deceive myself
i understand your alarm
i am not going to make a disturbance and break up your party
i can wait the archdeacon said drawing a rapid forcible breath
miss marjoribanks do you know who that man is
oh yes said lucilla softening into a smile
perfectly i assure you
he is one of papa's guests and very much respected in carlingford and he is one of myvery particular friends miss marjoribanks added
she laughed as she spoke a kind of laugh which is only appropriate to one subject and which is as good any day as a confession and the flush was so obliging as to return at that moment to her ingenuous countenance
we have known each other a long time lucilla went on after that pretty pause and then she raised her confiding eyes which had been cast down once more to the archdeacon's face
you can't think how nice he is mr beverley said miss marjoribanks
she clasped her hands together just for a moment as she did so with an eloquent meaning which it was impossible to mistake
the archdeacon for his part gazed at her like a man in a dream
whether it was trueor whether he was being made a fool of more completely than ever man before wasor whether he was the victim of an optical or some other kind of delusionthe poor man could not tell
he was utterly stricken dumb and did not know what to say
he accepted the soup humbly which thomas set before him though it was a white soup an effeminate dish which went utterly in the face of his principles
and then he looked at the innocent young creature at his side in that flutter of happy confusion
it was a terrible position for the broadchurchman
after such a tacit confession he could not spring from his seat and hurl the impostor out of the room as in the first place he had a mind to do
on the contrary it was with a voice trembling with emotion that he spoke
my dear miss marjoribanks said the archdeacon i am struck dumb by what you tell me
good heavens
that it should have come to this and yet i should be neglecting my duty if i kept silent
you do notyou cannot know who he is
oh yes said lucilla with another little laugheverythingand how he used to know mrs mortimer and all about it
he has no secrets from me said miss marjoribanks
she caught mr cavendish's eye at the moment who was casting a stealthy glance in her direction and who looked cowed and silenced and unquiet to the most miserable degree and she gave him a little reassuring nod which the archdeacon watched with an inward groan
what was he to do
he could not publicly expose the man who had just received this mark of confidence from his young hostess who knew everything
perhaps it was one of the greatest trials of christian patience and fortitude which the archdeacon who was not great as he himself would have said in the passive virtues had undergone in all the course of his life
he was so utterly subdued and confounded that he ate his soup and never found out what kind of soup it was
that is he consumed it in large spoonfuls without being aware by way of occupying his energies and filling up the time
you cannot mean it he said after a pause
you must be imperfectly informed
at least let me talk to your father
you must hear all the rights of the story
if you will let me speak half a dozen words toto that person miss marjoribanks i am sure he will leave the place he will give up any claim  oh yes please talk to him said miss marjoribanks it will be so nice to see you friends
nothing would make me so happy
you know i have heard all about it from you and from mrs mortimer already so i am sure there cannot be much more to tell and as for papa he is very fond of mr cavendish said lucilla with an imperceptible elevation of her voice
is it he whom you call mr cavendish
said the archdeacon
he too had raised his voice without knowing it and several people looked up who were not at the moment engaged in active conversation of their own
the owner of that name for his part also turned his face towards the upper end of the table
he was sick of the suspense and continued endurance and by this time was ready to rush upon his fate
did any one call me
he said and there was a little pause and the company in general fixed its regard upon those three people with a sense that something remarkable was going on among them though it could not tell what or why
the archdeacon wants to make your acquaintance said miss marjoribanks
mr cavendishmr beverley
there you know each other and when we are gone you can talk to each other if you like lucilla added but in the meantime you are too far off and i want the archdeacon
he is so much liked in carlingford she continued lowering her voice
you can't think how glad we are to have him back again
i am sure if you only knew him better said miss marjoribanks
as for the archdeacon words could not give any idea of the state of his mind
he ate his dinner sternly after that and did not look at anything but his plate
he consumed the most exquisite plats the tenderest wings of chicken and morsels of pat as if they had been his personal enemies
for to tell the truth he felt the tables altogether turned upon him and was confounded and did not know what it could mean
it was the general who took up mr beverley's abandoned place in the conversation
the gallant soldier talked for two with the best will in the world
he talked of cavendish and all the pleasant hours they had spent together and what a good fellow he was and how much the men in the club would be amused to hear of his domesticity
it was a kind of talk very natural to a man who found himself placed at table between his friend's sister and as he supposed his friend's future bride
and naturally the archdeacon got all the benefit
as for lucilla she received it with the most perfect grace in the world and saw all the delicate points of the general's wit and appreciated him so thoroughly that he felt half inclined to envy cavendish
by jove
he is the luckiest fellow i know general travers said and probably it was the charms of his intelligent and animated conversation that kept the ladies so long at table
mrs chiley for her part did not know what to make of it
she said afterwards that she kept looking at lucilla until she was really quite ashamed and though she was at the other end of the table she could see that the poor dear did not enjoy her dinner
it happened too that when they did move at last the drawingroom was fuller than usual
everybody had come that eveningsir john and some others of the county people who only came now and then and without any exception everybody in carlingford
and lucilla certainly was not herself for the first halfhour
she kept close to the door and regarded the staircase with an anxious countenance
when she was herself at the helm of affairs there was a certain security that everything would go on tolerablybut nobody could tell what a set of men left to themselves might or might not do
this was the most dreadful moment of the evening
mrs mortimer was in the drawingroom hidden away under the curtains of a window knowing nobody speaking to nobody and in a state of mind to commit suicide with pleasure but miss marjoribanks though she had cajoled her into that martyrdom took no notice of mrs mortimer
she was civil it is true to her other guests but there could not be a doubt that lucilla was horribly preoccupied and in a state of mind quite unusual to her
i am sure she is not well mrs chiley said who was watching her from afar
i saw that she did not eat any dinnerand the kind old lady got up slowly and extricated herself from the crowd and put herself in motion as best she could to go to her young friend's aid
it was at this moment that lucilla turned round radiant upon the observant assembly
the change occurred in less than a moment so suddenly that nobody saw the actual point of revolution
miss marjoribanks turned round upon the company and took mr cavendish's arm who had just come upstairs
there is a very very old friend of yours in the corner who wants to see you said lucilla and she led him across the room as a conqueror might have led a captive
she took him through the crowd to whom she dispensed on every side her most gracious glances
i am coming directly miss marjoribanks saidfor naturally she was called on all sides
what most people remarked at this moment was that the archdeacon who had also come in with the other gentlemen was standing very sullen and lowering at the door watching that triumphal progress
and it certainly was not lucilla's fault if mrs chiley and lady richmond and a few other ladies were thus led to form a false idea of the state of affairs
i suppose it is all right between them at last lady richmond said not thinking that barbara lake was standing by and heard her
according to appearances it was all perfectly right between them
miss marjoribanks triumphant led mr cavendish all the length of the room to the corner where the widow sat among the curtains and the archdeacon looked on with a visible passion and jealous rage which were highly improper in a clergyman but yet which were exciting to see
and this was how the little drama was to conclude according to lady richmond and mrs chiley who on the whole were satisfied with the conclusion
but naturally there were other people to be consulted
there was mr beverley whom miss marjoribanks held in leash but who was not yet subdued and there was dr marjoribanks who began to feel a little curiosity about his daughter's movements and did not make them out and there was barbara lake who had begun to blaze like a tempest with her crimson cheeks and black bold eyes
but by this time lucilla was herself again and felt the reins in her hands
when she had deposited mr cavendish in safety she faced round upon the malcontents and upon the observers and on the world in general
now that her mind was at rest and everything under her own inspection she felt herself ready and able for all
chapter xxxiii   the archdeacon stood before the fireplace with dr marjoribanks and a host of other gentlemen
mr beverley's countenance was covered with clouds and darkness
he stood not with the careless ease of a man amusing himself but drawn up to his full height and breadth a formidably muscular christian in a state of repression and restraint which it was painful and at the same time pleasing to see
the berserker madness was upon him and yet such are the restraints of society that a young woman's eye was enough to keep him downlucilla's eye and the presence of a certain number of other frivolous creatures in white muslin and of some old women as he irreverently called them who were less pleasant but not more imposing
he was an archdeacon and a leading man of his party whose name alone would have conferred importance upon any movement and whom his bishop himselfnot to speak of the clergy whom he charged in his visitation addresses like a regiment of cavalrystood a little in awe of
yet such are the beneficial restraints of society that he dared not follow his natural impulses nor even do what he felt to be his duty for fear of miss marjoribanks which was about the highest testimony to the value of social influence that could be given
at the same time it was but natural that under such circumstances the archdeacon should feel a certain savage wrath at the bond that confined him and be more indignant than usual at the false and tyrannical conventionalism called society
and it was at this moment of all times in the world that general travers like a halfeducated brute as according to mr beverley's ideas he was took the liberty of calling his attention to what the soldier called a lot of pretty girls
and everything admirably got up by jove
he added not having the remotest idea what effect so simple an observation might produce
yes it is admirably got up said the archdeacon with a snarl of concealed ferocity
you never said anything more profoundly true
it is all got up the women and the decorations and the gaiety and all this specious seeming
and these are creatures made in the image of god
said the broadchurchmanthe future wives and mothers of england
it is enough to make the devils laugh and the angels weep
it may be supposed that everybody was stricken with utter amazement by this unlookedfor remark
dr marjoribanks for his part took a pinch of snuff which as a general rule he only did at consultations or in the face of a difficulty and as for the unlucky soldier who had called it forth there can be no doubt that a certain terror filled his manly bosom for he naturally felt as if he must have said something extraordinary to call forth such a response
i never was accused before of saying anything profoundly true the general said and he grew pale
i didn't mean it i'm sure if that is any justification
where has cavendish vanished to i wonder
the soldier added looking round him scared and nervousfor it was evident that his only policy was to escape from society in which he was thus liable to commit himself without knowing how
female education is a monstrous mistake said mr beverleyalways has been and so far as i can see always will be
why should we do our best to make our women idiots
they are bad enough by nature
instead of counterbalancing their native frivolity by some real instructiongood heavens
the critic paused
it was not that his emotions were too much for him it was because the crowd opened a moment and afforded him a glimpse of a figure in black silk with the lace for which miss marjoribanks had stipulated falling softly over a head which had not quite lost its youthful grace
he gave a glance round him to see if the coast was clear
lucilla was out of the way at the other end of the room and he was free
he made but one stride through the unconscious assembly which he had been criticising so severely and all but knocked down little rose lake who was not looking at the archdeacon though she stood straight in his way
he might have stepped over her head without knowing it so much was he moved
all the gay crowd gave way before him with a cry and flutter and lucilla for her part was out of the way
but there are moments when to be out of the way is the highest proof of genius
miss marjoribanks had just had a cup of tea brought her of which she had great need and her face was turned in the other direction but yet she was aware that the archdeacon had passed like a berserker through those ranks which were not the ranks of his enemies
she felt without seeing it that the wind of his going agitated his own large coat tails and heavy locks and made a perfect hurricane among the white muslin
lucilla's heart beat quicker and she put down her tea though she had so much need of it
she could not swallow the cordial at such a moment of excitement
but she never once turned her head nor left off her conversation nor betrayed the anxiety she felt
up to this time she had managed everything herself which was comparatively easy but she felt by instinct that now was the moment to make a high effort and leave things alone
and it may be added that nothing but an inherent sense of doing the right thing under the circumstances could have inspired miss marjoribanks to the crowning achievement of keeping out of the way
when mr beverley arrived in front of the two people who were seated together in the recess of the window he made no assault upon them as his manner might have suggested
on the contrary he placed himself in front of them with his back to the company creating thus a most effectual moral and physical barrier between the little nook where his own private vengeance and fate were about to be enacted and the conventional world which he had just been denouncing
the archdeacon shut the two culprits off from all succour and looked down upon them casting them into profound shade
i don't know what combination of circumstances has produced this meeting he said but the time was ripe for it and i am glad it has happened and it was with dry lips and the calmness of passion that he spoke
mrs mortimer gave a little cry of terror but her companion for his part sat quite dumb and immovable
the moment had arrived at last and perhaps he too was glad it had come
he sat still expecting to see the earth crumble under his feet expecting to hear the humble name he had once borne proclaimed aloud and to hear ridicule and shame poured upon the impostor who had called himself one of the cavendishes
but it was no use struggling any longer
he did not even raise his eyes but sat still waiting for the thunderbolt to fall
but to tell the truth the archdeacon though a torrent of words came rushing to his lips felt at a difficulty how to begin
i don't understand how it is that i find you here with the man who has ruined your prospects he said with a slight incoherence and then he changed the direction of his attack
but it is you with whom i have to do he said you sir who venture to introduce yourself into society withwith your victim by your side
do you not understand that compassion is impossible in such a case and that it is my duty to expose you
you have told some plausible story here i suppose but nothing can stand against the facts
it is my duty to inform dr marjoribanks that it is a criminal who has stolen into his house and his confidencethat it is a conspirator who has ventured to approach his daughterthat it is  a criminal
a conspirator
said mr cavendish and he looked in his accuser's face with an amazement which notwithstanding his rage struck the archdeacon
if he had called him an impostor the culprit would have quailed and made no reply
but the exaggeration saved him
after that first look of surprise he rose to his feet and confronted the avenger who saw he had made a blunder without knowing what it was
you must be under some strange mistake he said
what do you accuse me of
i know nothing about crime or conspiracy
either you are strangely mistaken or you have forgotten what the words mean
they are words which i mean to prove said the archdeacon but there can be no doubt that his certainty was diminished by the surprise with which his accusation was received
it checked his first heat and it was with a slightly artificial excitement that he went on trying to work himself up again to the same point
you who worked yourself into a wretched old man's confidence and robbed an unoffending woman said mr beverley and then in spite of himself he stopped short for it was easier to say such things to a woman who contradicted without giving much reason than to a man who with an air of the utmost astonishment stood regarding his accuser in the face
these are very extraordinary accusations said mr cavendish
have you ever considered whether you had any proof to support them
he was not angry to speak of because he had been entirely taken by surprise and because at the same time he was unspeakably relieved and felt that the real danger the danger which he had so much dreaded was past and over
he recovered all his coolness from the moment he found out that it was not a venial imposition practised upon society but a social crime of the ugliest character of which he was accused
he was innocent and he could be tranquil on that score
as for robbing mrs mortimer he added with a little impatience she knows on the contrary that i have always been most anxious and ready to befriend her  to befriendher
cried the archdeacon restored to all his first impetuosity
he could not swear because it was against his cloth and his principles but he said good heavens
in a tone which would have perfectly become a much less mild expletive
it is better we should understand each other thoroughly he said
i am not in a humour for trifling
i consider it is her fortune which enables you to make an appearance here
it is her money you are living upon and which gives you position and makes you presume asas you are doingupon my forbearance
do you think it possible that i can pass over all this and let you keep what is not yours
if you choose to give up everything and retire from carlingford and withdraw all your pretensionsit is not for my part said mr beverley with solemnity taking breath to deal harshly with a penitent sinner
it is my duty as a clergyman to offer you at least a place of repentance
after that  but he was interrupted once more
mrs mortimer made her faint voice heard in a remonstrance
oh charles i always told youi had no right to anything
cried the terrified widow but that was not what stopped the archdeacon
it was because his adversary laughed that he stopped short
no doubt it was the metallic laugh of a man in great agitation but still mr beverley's ear was not fine enough at that moment to discriminate
he paused as a man naturally pauses at the sound of ridicule still furious yet abashed and half conscious of a ludicrous aspect to his passionand turned his full face to his antagonist and stood at bay
it is a modest request certainly mr cavendish said
give up all i have and all i am and perhaps you will forgive me
you must think me a fool to make such a proposal but look here said the accused energetically i will tell you the true state of affairs if for once you will listen
i do it not for my sake nor for your sake but for the sake ofof the women involved he added hastily and it was well for him that instead of looking at the shrinking widow beside him as he said so his eye had been caught by the eager eye of his sister who was watching from her corner
with that stimulus he went on calming himself down and somehow subduing and imposing upon the angry man by the mere act of encountering him fairly and openly
i will tell you what are the actual circumstances and you can see the will itself if you will take the trouble said the defendant with a nervous moderation and selfrestraint in which there was also a certain thrill of indignation
the old man you speak of might have left his money to a more worthy person than myself but he never meant to leave it to his grandniece and she knew that
she was neither his companion nor his nurse
there was nothing between them but a few drops of blood
for my part i gave himbut to be sure it would not interest you to know how i spent my youth
you came upon the scene likea man in a passion mr cavendish said with an abrupt laugh which this time was more feeble and proved that his composure was giving way and misjudged everything as was natural
you are doing the same again or trying to do it
but you are a clergyman and when you insult a man  i am ready to give him satisfaction said the broadchurchman hotly and then he made a pause and that sense of ridicule which is latent in every englishman's mind came to the archdeacon's aid
he began to feel ashamed of himself and at the same time his eye caught his own reflection in a mirror and the clerical coat which contrasted so grotesquely with his offer of satisfaction
mr beverley started a little and changed his tone
this has lasted long enough he said in his abrupt imperious way
this is not the place nor the time for such a discussion
we shall meet elsewhere the archdeacon added austerely with a significance which it is impossible to describe
his air and his words were full of severe and hostile meaning and yet he did not know what he meant any more than mr cavendish did who took him at his word and retired and made an end of the interview
whatever the archdeacon meant it was his adversary who was the victor
he went off threading his way through the curious spectators with a sense of relief that almost went the length of ecstasy
he might have been walking on his head for anything he knew
his senses were all lost and swallowed up in the overwhelming and incredible consciousness of safety
where were they to meet elsewhere
with pistols in a corner of carlingford common or perhaps with their fists alone as mr beverley was broadchurch
when a man has been near ruin and has escaped by a hairbreadth he may be permitted to be out of his wits for a few minutes afterwards
and the idea of fighting a duel with a dignitary of the church so tickled mr cavendish that he had not the prudence to keep it to himself
you will stand by me if he calls me out
he said to general travers as he passed and the air of utter consternation with which the warrior regarded him drove mr cavendish into such agonies of laughter that he had to retire to the landingplace and suffocate himself to subdue it
if any man had said to him that he was hysterical the chances are that it was he who would have called that man out or at least knocked him down
but he had to steal downstairs afterwards and apply to thomas for a cordial more potent than tea for naturally when a man has been hanging over an abyss for ever so long it is no great wonder if he loses his head and balance when he suddenly finds himself standing on firm ground and feels that he has escaped
as for the archdeacon when the other was gone he sat down silently on his abandoned chair
he was one of the men who take pride in seeing both sides of a question and to tell the truth he was always very candid about disputed points in theology and ready to entertain everybody's objection but it was a different thing when the matter was a matter of fact
he put down his face into his hands and tried to think whether it was possible that what he had just heard might be the true state of the case
to be sure the widow who was seated half fainting by his side had given him the same account often enough but somehow it was more effective from the lips of a man who confronted him than from the mild and weeping woman whom he loved better than anything else in the world but whose opinion on any earthly or heavenly subject had not the weight of a straw upon him
he tried to take that view of it and then it occurred to him that nothing was more ludicrous and miserable than the position of a man who goes to law without adequate reason or without proof to maintain his cause
such a horrible divergence from everything that was just and right might be as that the wellknown and highlyesteemed archdeacon beverley might be held up for the amusement and edification of the country in a times leader which was a martyrdom the archdeacon would have rather liked than otherwise in a worthy cause but not for a wretched private business connected with money
he sighed as he pondered feeling as so many have felt the difficulties which attend a good man's progress in this lifehow that which is just is not always that which is expedient and how the righteous have to submit to many inconveniences in order that the adversary may have no occasion to blaspheme
in this state of mind a man naturally softens towards a tender and wistful sympathiser close at hand
he sighed once more heavily and lifted his head and took into his own a soft pale hand which was visible near him among the folds of black silk
so you too have been brought into it helen the archdeacon said pathetically i did not expect to see you here
it was lucilla said mrs mortimer timidly it was not any wish of mine
oh charles
if you would let me speak
if you will but forget all this and think no more about it and i will do my best to make you a here the poor woman stopped short all at once
what she meant to have said was that she would make him a good wife which nature and truth and the circumstances all prompted her to sayas the only possible solution to the puzzle
but when she had got so far the poor widow stopped blushing and tingling all over with a sense of shame more overwhelming than if she had done a wicked action
it was nothing but pure honesty and affection that prompted her to speak and yet if it had been the vilest sentiment in human nature she would not have been so utterly ashamed
that was not what i meant to say
she cried with sharp and sudden wretchedness and was not the least ashamed of telling a downright lie instead
but to tell the truth the archdeacon was paying no particular attention
he had never loved any other woman but he was a little indifferent as to what innocent nonsense she might please to say
so that her confusion and misery and even the half offer of herself which occasioned these feelings were lost upon him
he kept her hand and caressed it in the midst of his own thoughts as if it was a child's head he was patting
my poor helen he said coming back to her when he found she had stopped speaking i don't see why you should not come if this sort of thing is any pleasure to you but afterwards he said reflectively
he went to that sort of thing often himself and rather liked it and did not think of any afterwards but perhaps the case of a weak woman was different or perhaps it was only that he happened to be after his downfall in a pathetic and reflective state of mind
afterwards
said mrs mortimer
she did not take the word in any religious or philosophical but in its merest matteroffact meaning and she was sadly hurt and wounded to see that he had not even noticed what she said much as she had been ashamed of saying it
she drew away her hand with a quick movement of despite and mortification which filled mr beverley with surprise
afterwards i shall go back to my little house and my school and shut myself in and never never come back again you may be sure said the widow with a rush of tears to her eyes
why they did not fall or how she kept herself from faintingshe who fainted so easilyshe never on reviewing the circumstances could tell and miss marjoribanks always attributed it to the fact that she was absent and there was no eaudecologne on the table
but whatever the cause might be mrs mortimer did not faint and perhaps there never was anything so like despair and bitterness as at that moment in her mild little feminine soul
never come back again
said the archdeacon rousing up a little and then he put out his large hand and took back the other as if it had been a pencil or a book that he had lost
all this let it be known was well in the shadow and could not be seen by the world in general to teach the young people a bad lesson
why should not you come back
i am going away too said mr beverley and he stopped short and resisted the effort his prisoner made to withdraw
oddly enough at that moment his rectory rose suddenly before him as in a visionhis rectory all handsome and sombre without a soul in it room after room uninhabited and not a sound to be heard except that of his own foot or his servant's
it was curious what connection there could be between that and the garden with its four walls and the tiny cottage covered with wistaria
such as it was it moved the archdeacon to a singular and considering the place and moment rather indecorous proceeding
instead of contenting himself with the resisting hand he drew the widow's arm within his as they sat together
i'll tell you what we must do helen he said confidentiallywe must go back to basing together you and i i don't see the good of leaving you by yourself here
you can make what alterations you like when you get to the rectory and i shall let thatthat person alone if you wish it with his illgotten gear
he will never come to any good said the archdeacon with some satisfaction and then he added in a parenthesis as if she had expressed some ridiculous doubt on the subject of course i mean that we should be married before we go away
it was in this rapid and summary manner that the whole business was settled
naturally his companion had nothing to say against such a reasonable arrangement
she had never contradicted him in her life about anything but one thing and that being set aside there was no possible reason why she should begin now
chapter xxxiv   this was how the crisis came to an end which had been of so much interest to the parties immediately affected
mrs woodburn had one of her nervous attacks next morning and was very ill and alarmed dr marjoribanks but at her very worst moment the incorrigible mimic convulsed her anxious medical adviser and all her attendants by a sudden adoption of the character of mrs mortimer whom she must have made a careful study of the previous night
tell him to tell him to go downstairs cried the halfdead patient i want to speak to him and he is not to hearif he were not so thoughtless he would offer him some lunch at least mrs woodburn said pathetically with closed eyes and a face as pale as death
she never did anything better in her life dr marjoribanks said afterwards and mr woodburn who was fond of his wife in his way and had been crying over her burst into such an explosion of laughter that all the servants were scandalised
and the patient improved from that moment
she was perfectly well and in the fullest force a week afterwards when she came to see lucilla who had also been slightly indisposed for a day or two
when thomas had shut the door and the two were quite alone mrs woodburn hugged miss marjoribanks with a fervour which up to that moment she had never exhibited
it was only necessary that we should get into full sympathy with each other as human creatures she said lifting her finger like the archdeacon and for all the rest of that autumn and winter mrs woodburn kept society in carlingford in a state of inextinguishable laughter
the odd thing was that miss marjoribanks who had been one of her favourite characters disappeared almost entirely from her repertory
not quite altogether because there were moments of supreme temptation which the mimic could not resist but as a general rule lucilla was the only woman in carlingford who escaped the universal critic
no sort of acknowledgment passed between them of the obligations one had to the other and what was still more remarkable no discussion of the terrible evening when lucilla had held the archdeacon with her eye and prevented the volcano from exploding
perhaps mrs woodburn for her part would have been pleased to have had such an explanation but miss marjoribanks knew better
she knew it was best not to enter upon confidences which neither could ever forget and which might prevent them meeting with ease in the midst of the little world which knew nothing about it
what lucilla knew she knew and could keep to herself but she felt at the same time that it was best to have no expansions on the subject
she kept it all to herself and made the arrangements for mrs mortimer's marriage and took charge of everything
everybody said that nothing could be more perfect than the bride's toilette which was as nice as could be and yet not like a real bride after all a difference which was only proper under the circumstances for she was married in lavender poor soul as was to be expected
you have not gone off the least bit in the world and it is quite a pleasure to see you lucilla said as she kissed her that morningand naturally all carlingford knew that it was owing to her goodness that the widow had been taken care of and provided for and saved up for the archdeacon
miss marjoribanks in short presided over the ceremony as if she had been mrs mortimer's mother and superintended the wedding breakfast and made herself agreeable to everybody
and in the meantime before the marriage took place most people in carlingford availed themselves of the opportunity of calling on mrs mortimer
if she should happen to be the future bishop's lady and none of us ever to have taken any notice of her somebody said with natural dismay
lucilla did not discourage the practical result of this suggestion but she felt an instinctive certainty in her mind that now mr beverley would never be bishop of carlingford and indeed that the chances were carlingford would never be elevated into a bishopric at all
it was not until after the marriage that mr cavendish went away
to be sure he was not absolutely present at the ceremony but there can be no doubt that the magnificent parure which mrs mortimer received the evening before her marriage from an old friend which made everybody's mouth water and which she herself contemplated with mingled admiration and dismay was sent by mr cavendish
do you think it could be from him or only from him
the bride said bewildered and bewildering
i am sure he might have known i never should require anything so splendid
but lucilla for her part had no doubt whatever on the subject and the perfect good taste of the offering made miss marjoribanks sigh thinking once more how much that was admirable was wasted by the fatal obstacle which prevented mr cavendish from aspiring to anybody higher than barbara lake
as for the archdeacon he too found it very easy to satisfy his mind as to the donor of the emeralds
he put them away from him severely and did not condescend to throw a second glance at their deceitful splendour
women are curiously constituted said mr beverley who was still at the height of superiority though he was a bridegroom
i suppose those sort of things give them pleasurethings which neither satisfy the body nor delight the soul
if it had been something to eat would it have pleased you better
said lucilla moved for once in her life to be impertinent like an ordinary girl
for really when a man showed himself so idiotic as to despise a beautiful set of emeralds it went beyond even the wellknown tolerance and compassionate goodhumour with which miss marjoribanks regarded the vagaries of the gentlemen
there is a limit in all things and this was going too far
i said to satisfy the body miss marjoribanks said the archdeacon which is an office very temporarily and inadequately performed by something to eat
i prefer the welfare of my fellowcreatures to a few glittering stoneseven when they are round her neck mr beverley added with a little concession to the circumstances
jewellery is robbery in a great town where there is always so much to be done and so little means of doing it to secure health to the people and education  yes said miss marjoribanks who knew in her heart that the archdeacon was afraid of her
it is so nice of you not to say any of those dreadful sanitary wordsand i am sure you could make something very nasty and disagreeable with that diamond of yours
it is a beautiful diamond if i were helen i should make you give it me said lucilla sweetly and the archdeacon was so much frightened by the threat that he turned his ring instinctively and quenched the glitter of the diamond in his closed hand
it was a present he said hastily and went away to seek some better occupation than tilting with the womankind who naturally had possession of the bride's little house and everything in it at that interesting moment
it was the last evening of lucilla's reign and she was disposed to take the full good of it
and though mrs mortimer's trousseau was modest and not as lydia brown repeated like that of a real bride it was still voluminous enough to fill the room to overflowing where it was all being sorted and packed under miss marjoribanks's eye
it is a very nice diamond indeed said lucilla if i were you i would certainly make him give it to merings are no good to a gentleman
they never have nice hands you knowthough indeed when they have nice hands said miss marjoribanks reflectively it is a great deal worse for they keep always thrusting them under your very eyes
it is curious why they should be so vain
they talk of women
lucilla added with natural derision but my dear if i were you i would make him give it me a nice diamond is always a nice thing to have
lucilla said the widow i am sure i don't know how to thank you for all you have done for me but dear if you please i would not talk like that
the gentlemen laugh but i am sure they don't like it all the same for indeed the bride thought it her duty having won the prize in her own person to point out to her young friend how to attain the same end she ought to behave
miss marjoribanks did not laugh for her sense of humour as has been said was not strong but she kissed her friend with protecting tenderness
my dear if that had been what i was thinking of i need never have come home said lucilla and her superiority was so calm and serene that mrs mortimer felt entirely ashamed of herself for making the suggestion
the widow was simpleminded and like most other women it gratified her to believe that here and there as in miss marjoribanks's case there existed one who was utterly indifferent to the gentlemen and did not care whether they were pleased or not which restored a little the balance of the world to the widowbride who felt with shame that she cared a great deal and was quite incapable of such virtue
as for lucilla herself she was not at that moment in conscious enjoyment of the strength of mind for which her friend gave her credit
on the contrary she could not help a certain sense of surprised depression as she superintended the packing of the boxes
the man had had it in his power to propose to her and he was going to be married to mrs mortimer
it was not that lucilla was wounded or disappointed but that she felt it as a wonderful proof of the imperfection and weakness of human nature
even in the nineteenth century which has learnt so much such a thing was possible
it filled her with a gentle sadness as she had the things put in and saw the emeralds safely deposited in their restingplace
not that she cared for the archdeacon who had thus disposed of himself but still it was a curious fact that such a thing could be
altogether it must be admitted that at this special moment miss marjoribanks occupied a difficult position
she had given the archdeacon to understand that mr cavendish was a very particular friend and even when the danger was past lucilla scorned to acknowledge her pious prevarications
during all this interval she continued so gracious to him that everybody was puzzled and mrs woodburn even insisted on her brother after all making his proposal which would be better late than never
i am sure she is fond of you said the softened mimic and that sort of thing doesn't matter to a woman as it does to a man for it has been already said that mrs woodburn notwithstanding her knack of external discrimination had very little real knowledge of character
and even at moments mr cavendish himself who ought to have known better was half tempted to believe that lucilla meant it
the effect upon dr marjoribanks was still more decided
he thought he saw in his daughter the indications of that weakness which is sometimes so surprising in women and it disturbed the doctor's serenity and he actually tried to snub lucilla on sundry occasions with that wonderful fatuity which is common to men
i hope when this marriage is over people will recover their senses
i hear of nothing else dr marjoribanks said one day at dessert when they were alone
he took some chestnuts as he spoke and burned his fingers which did not improve his temper
that sort of rubbish i suppose is much more interesting than attending to your natural duties the doctor added morosely which was not a kind of address which miss marjoribanks was used to hear
dear papa said lucilla if i attended to my duties ever so much i could not keep you from burning your fingers
there are some things that people must do for themselves the dutiful daughter added with a sigh
nobody could doubt who knew lucilla that she would have gladly taken the world on her shoulders and saved everybody from those little misadventures but how could she help it if people absolutely would not take care of themselves
the doctor smiled grimly but he was not satisfied
he was on the contrary furious in a quiet way
i don't need at this time of day to be told how clever you are lucilla said her father and i thought you had been superior to the ordinary folly of women  papa for heaven's sake
cried miss marjoribanks
she was really alarmed this time and she did not hesitate to let it be apparent
i do not mean to say that i always do precisely what i ought to do said lucilla nobody does that i know of but i am sure i never did anything to deserve that
i never was superior and i hope i never shall be and i know i never pretended to it she said with natural horror for the accusation as everybody will perceive was hard to bear
the doctor laughed again but with increased severity
we understand all that he said
i am not in the secret of your actions lucilla
i don't know what you intend or how far you mean to go
the only thing i know is that i see that young fellow cavendish a great deal oftener in the house and about it than i care to see him and i have had occasion to say the same thing before
i know nothing about his means said dr marjoribanks his property may be in the funds but i think it a great deal more likely that he speculates
i have worked hard for my money and i don't mean it to go in that way lucilla
i repeat i am not in the secret of your proceedings  dear papa
as if there was any secret said lucilla fixing her candid eyes upon her father's face
i might pretend i did not understand you if there was anything in what you say but i never go upon false pretences when i can help it
i am very fond of mr cavendish she continued regretfully after a pause
there is nobody in carlingford that is so nice but i don't see whom he can marry except barbara lake
miss marjoribanks would have scorned to conceal the unfeigned regret which filled her mind when she uttered these words
i am dreadfully sorry but i don't see anything that can be done for him she said and sighed once more
as for the doctor he forgot all about his chestnuts and sat and stared at her thinking in his ignorance that it was a piece of acting and not knowing whether to be angry or to yield to the amusement which began to rise in his breast
he may marry half a dozen barbara lakes said dr marjoribanks and i don't see what reason we should have to interfere so long as he doesn't want to marry you  that would be impossible papa said lucilla with pensive gravity
i am sure i am very very sorry
she has a very nice voice but a man can't marry a voice you know and if there was anything that i could doi am not sure that he ever wished for that either miss marjoribanks added with her usual candour
it is odd but for all that it is true
for it was a moment of emotion and she could not help giving utterance to the surprise with which this consideration naturally filled her mind
what is odd and what is true
said dr marjoribanks growing more and more bewildered
but lucilla only put aside her plate and got up from her chair
not any more wine thank you she said
i know you don't want me any more and i have so much to do
i hope you will let me invite barbara here when they are married and pay her a little attention for nobody likes her in grange lane and it would be so hard upon him
the more i think of it the more sorry i am said lucilla he deserved better papa but as for me everybody knows what is my object in life
thus miss marjoribanks left the table leaving her father in a singular state of satisfaction and surprise
he did not believe a word of what she had been saying with that curious perversity common to the people who surrounded lucilla and which arose not so much from doubt of her veracity as from sheer excess of confidence in her powers
he thought she had foiled him in a masterly manner and that she was only as people say amusing herself and had no serious intentions and he laughed quietly to himself when she left him in the satisfaction of finding there was nothing in it
miss marjoribanks for her part went on tranquilly with the arrangements for the marriage one by one she was disembarrassing herself from the complications which had grown round her during the first year of her reign in carlingford and now only the last links of the difficulty remained to be unrolled
the explanation she had with mr cavendish himself was in every way more interesting
it happened pretty late one evening when lucilla was returning with her maid from the widow's little cottage which was so soon to be deserted
she was just at that moment thinking of the wistaria which had grown so nicely and of all the trouble she had taken with the garden
nobody could tell who might come into it now after she had done so much for it and miss marjoribanks could not but have a momentary sense that on the whole it was a little ungrateful on the part of mrs mortimer when everybody had taken such pains to make her comfortable
at this moment indeed lucilla was slightly given to moralising though with her usual wisdom she kept her meditations to herself
she was thinking with a momentary vexation of all the plants that had been put into the beds and of so much time and trouble lostwhen mr cavendish came up to her
it was a cold evening and there was nothing in common between this walk and the walk they had taken together from grove street to grange lane on an earlier occasion
but this time so far from being reluctant to accompany her mr cavendish came to her side eagerly
the maid retired a little behind and then the two found themselves in that most perfect of all positions for mutual confidencea street not too crowded and noisy all shrouded in the darkness and yet twinkling with the friendly lights of an autumn evening
nothing could have been more perfect than their isolation from the surrounding world if they thought proper to isolate themselves and yet it was always there to be taken refuge in if the confidence should receive a check or the mind of the chance companions change
i have been trying to catch a glimpse of you for a long time said mr cavendish after they had talked a little in the ordinary way as everybody was doing in grange lane about the two people henceforward to be known in carlingford as the beverleys
but you are always so busy serving everybody
and i have a great deal to say to you that i don't know how to say
then don't say it please said lucilla
it is a great deal better not
it might be funny you know but i am not disposed to be funny tonight
i am very glad about mrs mortimer to be sure that she is to be settled so nicely and that they are going to be married at last
but after all when one thinks of it it is a little vexatious
just when her house was all put to rights and the garden looking so pretty and the school promising so well said lucilla and there was a certain aggrieved tone in her voice
and it is you who have done everything for her as for all the rest of us said mr cavendish though he could not help laughing a little and then he paused and his voice softened in the darkness by lucilla's side
do not let us talk of mrs mortimer he said
i sometimes have something just on my lips to say and i do not know whether i dare say it
miss marjoribanks  and here he came to a pause
he was fluttered and frightened which was what she and not he ought to have been
and at the bottom of his heart he did not wish to say it which gave far more force to his hesitation than simply a doubt whether he might dare
perhaps lucilla's heart fluttered too with a sense that the moment which once would not have been an unwelcome moment had at last arrived
her heart it is true was not very particularly engaged but still she was sensible of all mr cavendish's capacities and was very fond of him as she said and her exertions on his behalf had produced their natural effect and moved her affections a little
she made an involuntary pause for the hundredth part of a minute and reckoned it all up again and asked herself whether it were possible
there was something in the first place becoming and suitable in the idea that she who was the only person who knew his secret should take him and it together and make the best of them
and lucilla had the consciousness that she could indeed make a great deal of mr cavendish
nobody had ever crossed her path of whom so much could be made and as for any further danger of his real origin and position being found out and exposed to the world miss marjoribanks was capable of smiling at that when the defence would be in her own hands
she might yet accept him and have him elected member for carlingford and carry him triumphantly through all his difficulties
for a small partnay even for the half of a minutelucilla paused and made a rapid review of the circumstances and reconsidered her decision
perhaps if mr cavendish had been really in earnest that which was only a vague possibility might have become in another minute a fact and real
it was about the first time that her heart had found anything to say in the matter and the fact was that it actually fluttered in her reasonable bosom and experienced a certain malaise which was quite new to her
was it possible that she could be in love with mr cavendish
or was it merely the excitement of a final decision which made that unusual commotion far away down at the bottom of lucilla's heart
however that might be miss marjoribanks triumphed over her momentary weakness
she saw the possibility and at the same moment she saw that it could not be and while mr cavendish hesitated she who was always prompt and ready made up her mind
i don't know what i have done in particular either for her or the rest of you she said ignoring the other part of her companion's faltering address except to help to amuse you but i am going to do something very serious and i hope you will show you are grateful as you saythough i don't know what you have to be grateful aboutby paying great attention to me
mr cavendish i am going to give you good advice said lucilla and notwithstanding her courage she too faltered a little and felt that it was rather a serious piece of business that she had taken in hand
advice
mr cavendish said like an echo of her voice but that was all he found time to say
we are such old friends that i know you won't be vexed said lucilla and then we understand each other
it is so nice when two people understand each other they can say quantities of things that strangers cannot say
mr cavendish you and barbara are in love said lucilla making a slight pause and looking in his face
miss marjoribanks
cried the assaulted man in the extremity of his amazement and horror
as for lucilla she came a little closer to him and shook her head in a maternal semireproving way
don't say you are not said miss marjoribanks you never could deceive menot in anything like that
i saw it almost as soon as you met
they are not rich you know but they are very nice
mr lake and rose said lucilla with admirable prudence keeping off the difficult subject of barbara herself are the two very nicest people i know and everybody says that willie is dreadfully clever
i hope you will soon be married and that you will be very happy she continued with an effort
it was a bold thing to say and lucilla's throat even contracted a little as if to prevent the words from getting utterance but then she was not a person when she knew a thing was right to hesitate about doing it and in miss marjoribanks's mind duty went before all as has already been on several occasions said
after this a horrible silence fell upon the twoa silence which like darkness could be felt
the thunderbolt fell upon the victim's unprotected head without any warning
the idea that lucilla would talk to him about barbara lake was the very last that could have entered mr cavendish's mind
he was speechless with rage and mortification
he took it for an insult inflicted upon him in cold blood doing lucilla much injustice as the other people who took the candid expression of her sentiments for a piece of acting
he was a gentleman notwithstanding his doubtful origin and civilised down to his very fingertips but he would have liked to have knocked miss marjoribanks down though she was a woman
and yet as she was a woman he dared not for his life make any demonstration of his fury
he walked along by her side down into the respectable solitude of grange lane passing through a bright bit of george street and seeing askance by the light from the shop windows his adviser walking beside him with the satisfaction of a good conscience in her face
this awful silence lasted until they reached dr marjoribanks's door
thank you for coming with me so far said lucilla holding out her hand
i suppose i must not ask you to come in though papa would be delighted to see you
i am afraid you are very angry with me miss marjoribanks added with a touch of pathos but you may be sure i would always stand by you and i said it because i thought it was for the best
on the contrary i am much obliged to you said mr cavendish with quiet fury and deeply touched by the interest you take in my happiness
you may be sure i shall always be grateful for it and for the offer of your support said the ungrateful man with the most truculent meaning
as for miss marjoribanks she pressed quite kindly the hurried hand with which he touched hers and went in still saying goodnight
she had done her duty whatever might come of it
he rushed home furious but she went to a little worstedwork with a mind at peace with itself and all men
she was gentler than usual even to the maids who always found miss marjoribanks a good mistressbut she felt a little sad in the solitude of her genius
for it is true that to be wiser and more enlightened than one's neighbours is in most cases a weariness to the flesh
she had made a sacrifice and nobody appreciated it
instead of choosing a position which pleased her imagination and suited her energies and did not go against her heart lucilla moved by the wisest discretion had decided not without regret to give it up
she had sacrificed her own inclination and a sphere in which her abilities would have had the fullest scope to what she believed to be the general good and instead of having the heroism acknowledged she was misunderstood and rewarded with ingratitude
when miss marjoribanks found herself alone in the solitude of her drawingroom and in the still greater solitude as we have said of her genius she felt a little sad as was natural
but at the same moment there came into lucilla's mind a name a humble name which has been often pronounced in the pages of this history and it gave her once more a certain consolation
a sympathetic presence seemed to diffuse itself about her in her loneliness
there are moments when the faith of a very humble individual may save a great soul from discouragement and the consciousness of being believed in once more came with the sweetest and most salutary effect upon lucilla's heart
chapter xxxv   it was the very day after the marriage and two or three days after this conversation that mr cavendish left carlingford
he went to spend the winter in italy which had long been a dream of his as he explained to some of the young ladiesmost of whom had the same dream without the enviable power of carrying it out
he made very brief and formal adieux to lucilla to the extreme amazement of all the surrounding world and then disappeared leavingjust at that moment after the excitement of the marriage was over when grange lane stood most in need of somebody to rouse its drooping spiritsa wonderful blank behind him
lucilla said much less about her feelings on this occasion than she was in the habit of doing but there could be no doubt that she felt it and felt it acutely
and the worst of it was that it was she who was universally blamed for the sudden and unexplained departure of the most popular man in carlingford
some people thought he had gone away to escape from the necessity of proposing to her and some of more friendly and charitable disposition believed with mrs chiley that lucilla had refused him and some who were mostly outsiders and of a humble class were of opinion that miss marjoribanks had exercised all her influence to send mr cavendish out of the way of barbara lake
it was with this impression that rose made her way one of those foggy autumn mornings through the fallen leaves with which the garden was carpeted to see if any explanation was to be got from lucilla
the artinspectors from marlborough house had just paid their annual visit to carlingford and had found the female school of design in a condition which as they said in their report warranted the warmest encomiums and rose had also won a prize for her veil in the exhibition at kensington of ornamental art
these were triumphs which would have made the little artist overwhelmingly happy if they had not been neutralised by other circumstances but as it was they only aggravated the difficulties of the position in which she found herself
she came to lucilla in a bonneta circumstance which of itself was solemn and ominous for generally that portentous article of dress which was homemade and did not consist with cheerful dispositions was reserved by rose for going to church and her soft cheeks were pale and the hazel eyes more dewy than usual though it was rain and not dew that had been falling from them during those last painful days
i am ashamed to ask you such a question said rose but i want you to tell me lucilla if you know why mr cavendish has gone away
she will not come and ask you herself or rather i would not let her come for she is so passionate one does not know what she might do
you have behaved a little strange lucilla said the straightforward rose
if he cared for her and she cared for him you had no right to come and take him away
my dear i did not take him away said miss marjoribanks
i had to talk to him about somebusiness that was all
it is disgraceful of barbara to bother you about it who are only a baby and oughtn't to know anything  lucilla
cried rose with flashing eyes i am seventeen and i will not put up with it any longer
it is all your fault
what right had you to come and drag us to your great parties
we are not as rich as you nor as fine but we have a rank of our own cried the little artist
you have a great deal more money but we have some things that money cannot buy
you made barbara come and sing and put things into her head and you made me come though i did not want to
why did you ask us to your parties lucilla
it is all your fault
lucilla was in a subdued state of mind as may have been perceived and answered quite meekly
i don't know why you should all turn against me like this she said more sadly than surprised
it is unkind of you to say it was my fault
i did not expect it from you and when i have so many vexations miss marjoribanks added
she sat down as she spoke after being repulsed by rose with an air of depression which was quite unusual to her for to be blamed and misunderstood on all sides was hard for one who was always working in the service of her fellowcreatures and doing everything for the best
as for rose her heart smote her on the instant
have you vexations lucilla
she said in her innocence
it was the first time such an idea had entered into her mind
i don't think i have anything else said lucilla though even as she said it she began to recover her spirits
i do all i can for my friends and they are never pleased and when anything goes wrong it is always my fault
perhaps if you were not to do so much rose began to say for she was in her way a wise little woman but her heart smote her again and she restrained the truism and then after a little pause she resumed her actual business
i am ashamed to ask you but do you know where mr cavendish is lucilla
said rose
she is breaking her heart because he has gone away
did he never go to say goodbye nor anything
asked miss marjoribanks
she was sorry for it was quite the contrary of the advice she had given but still it would be wrong to deny that mr cavendish rose higher in lucilla's opinion when she heard it
i don't know any more than everybody knows
he has gone to italy but he will come back and i suppose she can wait miss marjoribanks added with perhaps a touch of contempt
for my part i don't think she will break her heart
it is because you do not know her said rose with some indignationfor at seventeen a broken heart comes natural
oh lucilla it is dreadful and i don't know what to do
cried the little artist changing her tone
i am a selfish wretch but i cannot help it
it is as good as putting an end to my career and just after my design has been so successfuland when papa was so proudand when i thought i might have been a help
it is dreadful to think of oneself when her heart is breaking but i shall have to give up everything and ii can't help feeling it lucilla cried rose with a sudden outburst of tears
all this was sufficiently unintelligible to miss marjoribanks who was not the least in anxiety about barbara's breaking heart
tell me what is the matter and perhaps we can do something said lucilla forgetting how little her past exertions had been appreciated and rose with equal inconsistency dried her tears at the sound of miss marjoribanks's reassuring voice
i know i am a wretch to be thinking of myself she said
she cannot be expected to stay and sacrifice herself for us after all she has suffered
she has made up her mind and advertised in the times and nothing can change it now
she is going out for a governess lucilla
going for awhat
said miss marjoribanks who could not believe her ears
for a governess said rose calmly for though she had been partly brought up at mount pleasant she had not the elevated idea of an instructress of youth which might have been expected from a pupil of that establishment
she has advertised in the times rose added with quiet despair with no objections to travel
i would do anything in the world for barbara but one can't help thinking of oneself sometimes and there is an end of my career
when she had said this she brushed the last tear off her eyelashes and sat straight up a little martyr and heroic victim to duty
her eye though fixed on empty space beamed keen with honour but still there was a certain desperation in the composure with which rose regarded after the first outburst the abandonment of all her hopes
she is a selfish thing said lucilla indignantly she always was a selfish thing
i should like to know what she can teach anybody
if i were you and your papa i certainly would not let her go away
i don't see any reason in the world why you should give in to her and let her stop youryour career you know why should you
i would not give in to her for one moment if i were your papa and you
why should i
said rose because there is nobody else to do anything lucilla
fleda and dreda are such two little things and there are all the boys to think of and poor papa
it is of no use asking why
if i don't do it there will be nobody to do it said rose with big tears coming to her eyes
her career was dear to her heart and those two tears welled up from the depths but then there would be nobody else to do ita consideration which continually filters out the people who are good for anything out of the muddy current of the ordinary world
and your pretty drawings and the veil and the school of design
cried lucilla
you dear little rose don't cry
it never can be permitted you know
she cannot teach anything and nobody will have her
she is a selfish thing though she is your sister and if i were your papa and you  it would be no good said rose
she will go whatever anybody may say
she does not care said the little martyr and the two big tears fell making two big round blotches upon the strings of that bonnet which lucilla had difficulty in keeping her hands off
but when she had thus expressed her feelings rose relented over her sister
she has suffered so much here how can any one ask her to sacrifice herself to us
said the young artist mournfully
and i am quite happy said rosequite happy it makes all the difference
it is her heart you know lucilla and it is only my career
and this time the tears were dashed away by an indignant little hand
barbara's heart if she had such an organ had never in its existence cost such bitter drops
but as for lucilla what could she do
she could only repeat if i was your papa and you with a melancholy sense that she was here balked and could do no more
for even the aid of miss marjoribanks was as nothing against dead selfishness and folly the two most invincible forces in the world
instead of taking the business into her own hands and carrying it through triumphantly as she had hitherto been in the habit of doing lucilla could only minister to the sufferer and keep up her courage and mourn over the career thus put in danger
barbara's advertisement was in the newspapers and her foolish mind was made up and the hope that nobody would have her was a forlorn hope for somebody always does have the incapable people as miss marjoribanks was well aware
and the contralto had been of some use in grange lane and a little in grove street and it would be difficult either in the one sphere or the other to find any one to fill her place
it was thus amid universal demolition that christmas approached and miss marjoribanks ended the first portion of her eventful career
chapter xxxvi   one fytte of lucilla's history is here ended and another is to be told
we have recorded her beginning in all the fulness of youthful confidence and undaunted trust in her own resources and have done our best to show that in the course of organising society miss marjoribanks like all other benefactors of their kind had many sacrifices to make and had to undergo the mortification of finding out that many of her most able efforts turned to other people's profit and went directly against herself
she began the second period of her career with to some certain extent that sense of failure which is inevitable to every high intelligence after a little intercourse with the world
she had succeeded in a great many things but yet she had not succeeded in all and she had found out that the most powerful exertions in behalf of friends not only fail to procure their gratitude but sometimes convert them into enemies and do actual harm which is a discovery which can only be made by those who devote themselves as miss marjoribanks had done to the good of the human species
she had done everything for the best and yet it had not always turned out for the best and even the people who had been most ready to appeal to her for assistance in their need had proved the readiest to accuse her when something disagreeable happened and to say it was your fault
in the second stage of her progress miss marjoribanks found herself with a great responsibility upon her shoulders with nearly the entire social organisation of carlingford depending upon her and at the same time with her means of providing for the wants of her subjects sensibly diminished and her confidence in the resources of the future impaired to an equal degree
one thing was sure that she had taken the work upon her shoulders and that she was not the woman to draw back whatever the difficulties might be
she did not bate a jot of her courage though the early buoyancy of hope had departed never to return
it is true that she was not so joyful and triumphant a figure as when she conquered nancy and won over dr marjoribanks and electrified mr holden by choosing curtains which suited her complexion but with her diminished hopes and increased experience and unabated courage no doubt miss marjoribanks presented a still nobler and more imposing aspect to everybody who had an eye for moral grandeur though it would be difficult to tell how many of such worthy spectators existed in grange lane
there was as our readers are aware another subject also on which lucilla had found her position altered
it was quite true that had she been thinking of that she never need have come home at all and that in accepting new furniture for the drawingroom she had to a certain extent pledged herself not to marry immediately but to stay at home and be a comfort to her dear papa
this is so delicate a question that it is difficult to treat it with the freedom necessary for a full development of a not unusual state of mind
most people are capable of falling in love only once or twice or at the most a very few times in their life and disappointed and heartbroken suitors are not so commonly to be met with as perhaps could be wished
but at the same time there can be little doubt that the chief way in which society is supposed to signify its approval and admiration and enthusiasm for a lady is by making dozens of proposals to her as may be ascertained from all the bestinformed sources
when a woman is a great beauty or is very brilliant and graceful or even is only agreeable and amusing the ordinary idea is that the floating men of society in number less or more according to the lady's merits propose to her though she may not perhaps accept any of them
in proportion as her qualities rise towards the sublime these victims are supposed to increase and perhaps to tell the truth no woman feels herself set at her true value until some poor man or set of men have put as people say their happiness into her hands
it is as we have said a delicate subject to discuss for the truth is that this wellknown and thoroughly established reward of female excellence had not fallen to miss marjoribanks's lot
there was tom to be sure but tom did not count
and as for the other men who had been presented to lucilla as eligible candidates for her regard none of them had given her this proof of their admiration
the year had passed away and society had laid no tribute of this description upon lucilla's shrine
the archdeacon had married mrs mortimer instead and mr cavendish had been led away by barbara lake
after such an experience nothing but the inherent sweetness and wholesome tone of miss marjoribanks's character could have kept her from that cynicism and disbelief in humanity which is so often the result of knowledge of the world
as for lucilla she smiled as she thought of it not cynically but with a sweetly melancholy smile
what she said to herself was poor men
they had had the two ways set before them and they had not chosen the best
it made her sad to have this proof of the imperfection of human nature thrust upon her but it did not turn her sweet into bitter as might have been the case with a more ordinary mind
notwithstanding that this universal reward which in other cases is as everybody knows given so indiscriminately and with such liberality had altogether failed in her case lucilla still resumed her way with a beautiful constancy and went forward in the face of fate undaunted and with a smile
it was thus that she began the second period of her career
up to this moment there had never been a time in which it was not said in carlingford that some one was paying attention to miss marjoribanks but at present no one was paying attention to her
there were other marriages going on around her and other preliminaries of marriage but nobody had proposed to lucilla
affairs were in this state when she took up her burden again boldly and set out anew upon her way
it was a proof of magnanimity and philanthropy which nobody could have asked from her if lucilla had not been actuated by higher motives than those that sway the common crowd
without any assistance but that of her own geniuswithout the stimulating applause of admirers such as a woman in such circumstances has a right to calculate uponwith no sympathising soul to fall back upon and nothing but a dull level of ordinary people before hermiss marjoribanks undaunted put on her harness and resumed her course
the difficulties she had met only made her more friendly more tender to those who were weaker than herself and whom evil fortune had disabled in the way
when barbara lake got her situation and went out for a governess and rose's fears were realised and she had with bitter tears to relinquish her career lucilla went and sat whole afternoons with the little artist and gave her the handiest assistance and taught her a great many things which she never could have learned at the school of design
and the effect of this selfabnegation was that lucilla bore general travers's decision and gave up all hope of the officers with a stoutheartedness which nobody could have looked for and did not hesitate to face her position boldly and to erect her standard and to begin her new campaign unaided and unappreciated as she was
people who know no better may go away upon marriage tours or they may fly off to foreign travel or go out as governesses when all things do not go just as they wish
but as for miss marjoribanks she stood bravely at her post and scorned to flinch or run away
thus commenced amid mists of discouragement and in an entire absence of all that was calculated to stimulate and exhilarate the second grand period of lucilla's life
chapter xxxvii   it would be vain to follow lucilla in detail through her consistent and admirable career nor is it necessary to say that she went on steadily in face of all her discouragements with that mixture of success and failure which comes natural to all human affairs
the singular thing about it was that the years passed on and that she was permitted by the world in general to fulfil her own promise and prophecy about remaining ten years at home to be a comfort to her dear papa
she had been nineteen when she began her career and she was nineand twenty when that little episode occurred with young dr rider before he was married to his present wife
there would have been nothing in the least unsuitable in a marriage between dr rider and miss marjoribanks though people who were the best informed never thought either of them had any serious meaning but of course the general public having had lucilla for a long time before their eyes naturally added on seven or eight years to her age and concluded her to be a great deal older than the young doctor though everybody allowed that it would have been a most advantageous match for him in every possible point of view
but however it did not come to anything no more than a great many other nibbles of the same kind did
the period arrived at which lucilla had thought she might perhaps have begun to go off in her looks but still there was no immediate appearance of any change of name or condition on her part
many people quite congratulated themselves on the fact as it was impossible to imagine what might be the social condition of grange lane without miss marjoribanks but it is doubtful whether lucilla congratulated herself
she was very comfortable no doubt in every way and met with little opposition to speak of and had things a great deal more in her own hands than she might have had had there been a husband in the case to satisfy but notwithstanding she had come to an age when most people have husbands and when an independent position in the world becomes necessary to selfrespect
to be sure lucilla was independent but thenthere is a difference as everybody knows
and miss marjoribanks could not but feel that the world had not shown that appreciation of her to which in her earlier days she looked forward with so little fear
the ten years as they had really gone by were very different from the ten years she had looked forward to when in the triumph of her youth she named that period as the time when she might probably begin to go off and would be disposed to marry
by this time the drawingroom carpets and curtains had faded a little and lucilla had found out that the delicate pale green which suited her complexion was not to call a profitable colour and nobody could have thought or said that to marry at this period would be in the least degree to swindle the doctor
thus the moment had arrived to which she looked forward but the man had not arrived with it
ten years had passed during which she had been at the head of society in grange lane and a great comfort to her dear papa and now if there remained another development for lucilla's character it was about time that it should begin to show itself
but at the same time the main element necessary for that new development did not seem at present likely to be found in grange lane
unless indeed it might happen to be found in the person of mr ashburton who was so often in carlingford that he might be said to form a part of society there
it was he who was related to the richmonds who were a family much respected in the county
he had been at the bar and even begun to distinguish himself before old miss penrhyn died and left him the firs
he had begun to distinguish himself but he had not it appeared gone so far as to prevent him from coming down to his new property and settling upon it and taking his place as a local notability
he was not a man who could be expected to care for evening parties in a provincial town but he never refused to dine with dr marjoribanks and was generally popular upstairs where he always paid a little attention to lucilla though nothing very marked and noticeable
mr ashburton was not like mr cavendish for instance if anybody remembered mr cavendish a man whose money might be in the funds but who more probably speculated
everybody knew everything about him which was an ease to the public mind
the firs was as well known as carlingford steeple and how much it was worth a year and everything about it and so was the proprietor's pedigree which could be traced to a semimythical personage known as old penrhyn whose daughter was sir john richmond's grandmother
the firs it is true had descended in the female line but still it is something to know where a man comes from even on one side
mr ashburton made himself very agreeable in the neighbourhood and was never above enlightening anybody on a point of law
he used to say that it was kind to give him something to do which was an opinion endorsed practically by a great many people
it is true that some of his neighbours wondered much to see his patience and could not make out why he chose to rusticate at the firs at his age and with his abilities
but either he never heard these wonderings or at least he never took any notice of them
he lived as if he liked it and settled down and presented to all men an aspect of serene contentment with his sphere
and it would be difficult to say what suggestion or association it was which brought him all of a sudden into miss marjoribanks's head one day when seeing a little commotion in masters's shop she went in to hear what it was about
the cause of the commotion was an event which had been long expected and which indeed ten years before had been looked on as a possible thing to happen any day
the wonder was not that old mr chiltern should die but that he should have lived so long
the ladies in masters's cried poor dear old man
and said to each other that however long it might have been expected a death always seemed sudden at the last
but to tell the truth the stir made by this death was rather pleasant than sad
people thought not of the career which was ended but of the one which must now begin and of the excitement of an election which was agreeable to look forward to
as for lucilla when she too had heard the news and had gone upon her way it would be vain to assert that a regretful recollection of the time when mr cavendish was thought a likely man to succeed mr chiltern did not occur to her
but when miss marjoribanks had dismissed that transitory thought mr ashburton suddenly came into her head by one of those intuitions which have such an effect upon the mind that receives them
lucilla was not of very marked political opinions and perhaps was not quite aware what mr ashburton's views were on the irish church question or upon parliamentary reform but she said after that it came into her mind in a moment like a flash of lightning that he was the man
the idea was so new and so striking that she turned back and went in the excitement of the moment to suggest it to mrs chiley and see what her old friend and the colonel would say
of course if such a thing was practicable there was no time to lose
she turned round quickly according to her prompt nature and such was her absorbed interest in the idea of mr ashburton that she did not know until she had almost done it that she was walking straight into her hero's arms
oh mr ashburton
said lucilla with a little scream is it you
my mind was quite full of you
i could not see you for thinking
do come back with me for i have something very particular to say  to me
said mr ashburton looking at her with a smile and a sudden look of interest for it is always slightly exciting to the most philosophical mortal to know that somebody else's mind is full of him
what you have said already is so flattering  i did not mean anything absurd said miss marjoribanks
don't talk any nonsense please
mr ashburton do you know that old mr chiltern is dead
lucilla put the question solemnly and her companion grew a little red as he looked at her
it is not my fault he said though he still smiled and then he grew redder and redder though he ought to have been above showing such signs of emotion and looked at her curiously as if he would seize what she was going to say out of her eyes or her lips before it was said
it is not anything to laugh about said lucilla
he was a very nice old man but he is dead and somebody else must be member for carlingford that was why i told you that my mind was full of you
i am not in the least superstitious said miss marjoribanks solemnly but when i stood therethere just in front of mr holden'syou came into my mind like a flash of lightning
i was not thinking of you in the least and you came into my mind likelike minerva you know
if it was not an intimation i don't know what it was
and that was why i ran against you and did not see you were there
mr ashburton it is you who must be the man said lucilla
it was not a thing to speak lightly about and for her part she spoke very solemnly and as for mr ashburton his face flushed deeper and deeper
he stood quite still in the excitement of the moment as if she had given him a blow
miss marjoribanks i don't know how to answer you he cried and then he put out his hand in an agitated way and grasped her hand
you are the only creature in carlingford man or woman that has divined me he said in a trembling voice
it was a little public at the top of grange lane where people were liable to pass at every moment but still miss marjoribanks accepted the pressure of the hand which to be sure had nothing whatever to do with lovemaking
she was more shy of such demonstrations than she had been in her confident youth knowing that in most cases they never came to anything and at the same time that the spectators kept a vivid recollection of them but still in the excitement of the moment miss marjoribanks accepted and returned in a womanly way the pressure of mr ashburton's hand
come in and let us talk it over lucilla said feeling that no time was to be lost
it was a conference very different from that which had mr chiltern been so well advised as to die ten years before might have been held in dr marjoribanks's drawingroom over his successor's prospects but at the same time there was something satisfactory to the personal sentiments of both in the way in which this conversation had come about
when lucilla took off her hat and sat down to give him all her attention mr ashburton could not but feel the flattering character of the interest she was taking in him
she was a woman and young comparatively speaking and was by no means without admirers and unquestionably took the lead in society and to be divined by such a person was perhaps on the whole sweeter to the heart of the aspirant than if colonel chiley had found out his secret or dr marjoribanks or even the rector and lucilla for her part had all that natural pleasure in being the first to embrace a new interest which was natural under the circumstances
let us talk it all over she said giving mr ashburton a chair near her own
if i believed in spiritrapping you know i should be sure that was what it meant
i was not thinking of you in the least and all at once like a flash of lightningmr ashburton sit down and tell mewhat is the first thing that must be done
if i could ask you to be on my committee that would be the first thing to be done said mr ashburton but unfortunately i can't do that
let me tell you in the first place how very much i am obliged  don't say that please said miss marjoribanks with her usual good sense for i have done nothing
but papa can be on the committee and old colonel chiley who is such a one for politics and of course sir johnthat will be a very good beginning and after that  my dear miss marjoribanks mr ashburton said with a smile and a little hesitation sir john takes exactly the other side in politics and i am afraid the doctor and the colonel are not of the same way of thinking and then my opinions  if they are not of the same way of thinking we must make them said lucilla after having such an intimation i am not going to be put off for a trifle and besides what does it matter about opinions
i am sure i have heard you all saying over and over that the thing was to have a good man
don't go and make speeches about opinions
if you begin with that there is no end to it said miss marjoribanks
i know what you gentlemen are
but if you just say distinctly that you are the best man  it would be an odd thing to say for oneself said mr ashburton and he laughed but to tell the truth he was not a man of very quick understanding and at the first outset of the thing he did not understand lucilla and he was a littlejust a very littledisappointed
she had divined him which was a wonderful proof of her genius but yet at the bottom she was only an ignorant woman after all
i see it all quite clear what to do said miss marjoribanks
you must have the colonel and sir john and everybody
i would not pay the least attention to tories or whigs or anything of the sort
for my part i don't see any difference
all that has to be said about it is simply that you are the right man
papa might object to one thing and the colonel might object to another and then if sir john as you say is of quite another way of thinkingbut you are the man for carlingford all the same and none of them can say a word against that said lucilla with energy
she stopped short with her colour rising and her eyes brightening
she felt herself inspired which was a new sensation and very pleasant and then the idea of such a coming struggle was sweet to miss marjoribanks and the conviction burst upon her that she was striking out a perfectly new and original line
as for her candidate he smiled and hesitated and paid her pretty little compliments for a few minutes longer and said it was very good of her to interest herself in his fortunes
all which lucilla listened to with great impatience feeling that it had nothing to do with the matter in hand
but then after these few minutes had elapsed the meaning of his fair adviser as he called her began to dawn upon mr ashburton's mind
he began to prick up his mental ears so to speak and see that it was not womanish ignorance but an actual suggestion
for after all so long as he was the man for carlingford all the rest was of little importance
he took something out of his pocket which was his address to the constituency of carlingford for being anxious on the subject he had heard of mr chiltern's death an hour or two before anybody else and chokefull of political sentiments
in it he described to the electors what he would do if they sent him to parliament as carefully as if their election could make him prime minister at least and naturally a man does not like to sacrifice such a confession of faith
i should like to read it to you he said spreading it out with affectionate care but lucilla had already arranged her plans and knew better than that
if you were to read it to me said miss marjoribanks i should be sure to be convinced that you were quite right and to go in with you for everything and then i should be no good you know
if it were to drive papa and sir john and the colonel all to their own ways of thinking we never should make any progress
i would never mind about anybody's ways of thinking if i were you
after all said lucilla with fine satire of which she was unconscious what does it matter what people think
i suppose when it comes to doing anything the whigs and the tories are just the same
mr ashburton it is the man that is wanted said miss marjoribanks with all the warmth of sudden conviction
she felt a little like joan of arc as she spoke
when an army has the aid of a sacred maiden to bring inspiration to its counsels the idea of going on in the old formal way is no longer to be tolerated
and such was the force of lucilla's conviction that mr ashburton though he felt a little affronted and could not but look with fond and compunctious regret upon his address yet began more and more to feel that there was justice in what she said
i will think over what you say he said rather stiffly and put up his addressfor it was natural when he had done her such an honour as to offer to read it to her that he should be affronted by her refusal
it was a bold experiment on lucilla's part but then she was carried out of herself at the moment by this singular flash of inspiration
i will think over what you say mr ashburton continued and if my judgment approvesat all events i shall not issue this till i have thought it all over
i am sure i am extremely obliged to you for your interest
and here he stopped short and looked as if he were going to get up and go away which would have spoiled all
you are going to stop to lunch said lucilla somebody is sure to come in
and you know you must not lose any opportunity of seeing people
i am so glad tonight is thursday
tell me just one thing mr ashburton before any one comes
there is one thing that is really important and must be fixed upon
if we were to make any mistake you know  what
said the candidate eagerlyabout reform
i have expressed myself very clearly  lucilla smiled compassionately and with the gentlest tolerance at this wild suggestion
i was not thinking of reform she said with that meekness which people assume when it is of no use being impatient
i was thinking what your colours were to be
i would not have anything to do with the old colours for my partthey would be as bad as opinions you know
you may laugh but i am quite in earnest said miss marjoribanks
as for mr ashburton he did not begin to laugh until he had fixed upon her that gaze of utter amazement and doubt with which on many similar occasions ordinary people had regarded lucillathinking she was joking or acting or doing something quite different from the severe sincerity which was her leading principle
she was so used to it that she waited with perfect patience till her companion's explosion of amusement was over
he was thinking to himself what a fool she was or what a fool he was to think of taking a woman into his counsels or what curious unintelligible creatures women were made up of sense and folly and all the time he laughed which was a relief to his feelings
miss marjoribanks laughed a little too to keep him in countenance for she was always the soul of good nature and then she repeated now you must tell me what our colours are to be  i am sure i don't know anything about colours said the candidate any more than you do about opinions
i think they are equally unimportant to say the least
i shall adopt the colours of my fair counsellor mr ashburton added laughing and making a mock bow to her and getting his hat as he did sofor he had naturally calmed down a little from the first enthusiasm with which he had hailed the woman who divined him and he did not mean to stay
blue and yellow are the old colours said lucilla thoughtfully and you are the new man you know and we must not meddle with these antiquated things
do you think this would do
as she spoke she took up a handful of ribbons which were lying by and put them up to her face with an air of serious deliberation which once more disturbed mr ashburton's gravity
and yet when a young woman who is not at all badlooking puts up a rustling gleaming knot of ribbons to her hair and asks a man's opinion of the same the man must be a philosopher or a wretch indeed who does not give a glance to see the effect
the candidate for carlingford looked and approached and even in the temptation of the moment took some of the long streamers in his hand
and he began to think miss marjoribanks was very clever and the most amusing companion he had met with for a long time
and her interest in him touched his heart and after all it is no drawback to a woman to be absurd by moments
his voice grew quite soft and caressing as he took the end of ribbon into his hand
if they are your colours they shall be mine he said with a sense of patronage and protection which was very delightful and the two were still talking and laughing over the silken link thus formed between them when the people came in whom lucilla was expecting to lunch and who were naturally full of mr chiltern's death which poor old man
was so sudden at the last
mr ashburton stayed though he had not intended it and made himself very pleasant
and lucilla took no pains to conceal her opinion that the thing was neither to consider whigs nor tories but a good man
and major brown who had come with his daughters echoed this sentiment so warmly that mr ashburton was entirely convinced of the justice of miss marjoribanks's ideas
we can't have a tiptopper you know major brown said who was not very refined in his expressions and what i should like to see is a man that knows the place and would look after carlingford
that's what we're all looking for
mr ashburton did not declare himself to major brown but he dashed off his new address ten minutes after he had taken leave of miss marjoribanks and put the other one in the fire like a christian and telegraphed for his agent to town
lucilla for her part made an effort equally great and uncompromising
she took the ribbon mr ashburton had played with and cut it up into cockades of all descriptions
it was an early moment but still there was no time to be lost in a matter of such importance
and she wore one on her breast and one in her hair when mr ashburton's address was published and all the world was discussing the new candidate
of course they are his coloursthat is why i wear them said lucilla
i shall always think there was something very strange in it
just after i had heard of poor old mr chiltern's death as i was passing holden'swhen i was not in the least thinking of himhe came into my mind like a flash of lightning you know
if i had been very intimate with poor old mr chiltern or if i believed in spiritrapping i should think that was it
he came into my head without my even thinking of him all in a moment with his very hat on and his umbrella like minervawasn't it minerva
said miss marjoribanks
and she took up mr ashburton's cause openly and unfurled his standard and did not even ask her father's opinion
papa knows about politics but he has not had an intimation as i have said lucilla
and naturally she threw all the younger portion of grange lane which was acquainted with mr ashburton and looked forward eagerly to a little excitement and liked the idea of wearing a violetandgreen cockade into a flutter of excitement
among these rash young people there were even a few individuals who took lucilla's word for it and knew that mr ashburton was very nice and did not see that anything more was necessary
to be sure these enthusiasts were chiefly women and in no cases had votes but miss marjoribanks with instinctive correctness of judgment decided that there were more things to be thought of than the electors
and she had the satisfaction of seeing with her own eyes and hearing with her own ears the success of that suggestion of her genius
carlingford had rarely been more excited by any public event than it was by the address of the new candidate who was in the field before anybody else and who had the boldness to come before them without uttering any political creed
the enlightened electors of carlingford do not demand like other less educated constituencies a system of political doctrines cut and dry or a representative bound to give up his own judgment and act according to arbitrary promises said the daring candidate what they want is an honest man resolved to do his duty by his country his borough and his constituency and it is this idea alone which has induced me to solicit your suffrages
this was what mr ashburton said in his address though at that moment he had still his other address in his pocket in which he had entered at some length into his distinctive personal views
it was thus that an independent candidate unconnected with party took the field in carlingford with miss marjoribanks like another joan of arc wearing a knot of ribbons violet and green in her hair to inspire and lead him on
chapter xxxviii   life with most people is little more than a succession of high and low tides
there are times when the stream runs low and when there is nothing to be seen but the dull sandbanks or even mudbanks for months or even years together and then all at once the waters swell and come rushing twice a day like the sea carrying life and movement with them
miss marjoribanks had been subject to the eaux mortes for a long time but now the springtides had rushed back
a day or two after mr ashburton had been revealed to her as the predestined member something occurred not in itself exciting but which was not without its ultimate weight upon the course of affairs
it was the day when aunt jemima was expected in grange lane
she was aunt jemima to lucilla but the doctor called her mrs john and was never known to address her by any more familiar title
she was as she herself described it a widow lady and wore the dress of her order and was the mother of tom marjoribanks
she was not a frequent visitor at carlingford for she and her brotherinlaw had various points on which they were not of accord
the doctor for his part could not but feel perennially injured that the boy had fallen to the lot of mrs john while he had only a girleven though that girl was lucilla and aunt jemima could not forgive him for the rude way in which he treated her health which was so delicate and his want of sympathy for many other people who were delicate too
even when she arrived and was being entertained with the usual cup of tea fears of her brotherinlaw's robustness and unsympathetic ways had begun to overpower her
i hope your papa does not ask too much from you lucilla she said as she sat in her easychair and took her tea by the fire in the cosy room which had been prepared for her
i hope he does not make you do too much for i am sure you are not strong my dear
your poor mamma you know and mrs john looked with a certain pathos at her niece as though she saw signs of evil in lucilla's fresh complexion and substantial frame
i am pretty well thank you aunt jemima said miss marjoribanks and papa lets me do pretty much what i like i am too old now you know to be told what to do
don't call yourself old my dear said aunt jemima with a passing gleam of worldly wisdomone gets old quite soon enough
are you subject to headaches lucilla or pains in the limbs
your poor mamma  dear aunt jemima i am as well as ever i can be said miss marjoribanks
tell me when you heard from tom and what he is doing
let me see it is ten years since he went away
i used to write to him but he did not answer my lettersnot as he ought you know
i suppose he has found friends among the calcutta ladies said lucilla with a slight but not unapparent sigh
he never says anything to me about calcutta ladies said tom's mother to tell the truth i always thought before he went away that he was fond of youi must have been mistaken as he never said anything and that was very fortunate at all events
i am sure i am very thankful he was not fond of me said lucilla with a little natural irritation for i never could have returned it
but i should like to know why that was so fortunate
i can't see that it would have been such a very bad thing for him for my part
yes my dear said aunt jemima placidly it would have been a very bad thing for you know lucilla though you get on very nicely here you never could have done for a poor man's wife
miss marjoribanks's bosom swelled when she heard these wordsit swelled with that profound sense of being unappreciated and misunderstood which is one of the hardest trials in the way of genius but naturally she was not going to let her aunt see her mortification
i don't mean to be any man's wife just now she said making a gulp of iti am too busy electioneering we are going to have a new member in dear old mr chiltern's place
perhaps he will come in this evening to talk things over and you shall see him lucilla added graciously
she was a little excited about the candidate as was not unnaturalmore excited perhaps than she would have been ten years ago when life was young and then it was not to be expected that she could be pleased with aunt jemima for thinking it was so fortunate though even that touch of wounded pride did not lead miss marjoribanks to glorify herself by betraying tom
my brotherinlaw used to be a dreadful radical said aunt jemima i hope it is not one of those revolutionary men i have seen your poor uncle sit up arguing with him till i thought they never would be done
if that is the kind of thing i hope you will not associate yourself with it lucilla
your papa should have more sense than to let you
i should never have permitted it if you had been my daughter added mrs john with a little heatfor to tell the truth she too felt a slight vexation on her part that the doctor had the girleven though not for twenty girls would she have given up tom
miss marjoribanks looked upon the weak woman who thus ventured to address her with indescribable feelings but after all she was not so much angry as amused and compassionate
she could not help thinking to herself if she had been mrs john's daughter how perfectly docile aunt jemima would have been by this time and how little she would have really ventured to interfere
it would have been very nice she said with a meditative realisation of the possibilitythough it is very odd to think how one could have been one's own cousini should have taken very good care of you i am sure
you would have done no such thing said mrs john you would have gone off and married i know how girls do
you have not married now because you have been too comfortable lucilla
you have had everything your own way and all that you wanted without any of the bother
it is very strange how differently people's lots are ordered
i was married at seventeenand i am sure i have not known what it was to have a day's health  dear aunt jemima
said her affectionate niece kissing her but papa shall see if he cannot give you something and we will take such care of you while you are here
mrs john was softened in spite of herself but still she shook her head
it is very nice of you to say so my dear she said and it's pleasant to feel that one has somebody belonging to one but i have not much confidence in your papa
he never understood my complaints
i used to be very sorry for your poor mamma
he never showed that sympathybut i did not mean to blame him to you lucilla
i am sure he is a very good father to you
he has been a perfect old angel said miss marjoribanks and then the conversation came to a pause as it was time to dress for dinner
mrs john marjoribanks had a very nice room and everything that was adapted to make her comfortable but she too had something to think of when the door closed upon lucilla and she was left with her maid and her hot water and her black velvet gown
perhaps it was a little inconsistent to wear a black velvet gown with her widow's cap it was a question which she had long debated in her mind before she resigned herself to the temptationbut then it always looked so well and was so very profitable
and mrs john felt that it was incumbent upon her to keep up a respectable appearance for tom's sake
tom was very much in her mind at that moment as indeed he always was for though it was a long time ago she could not get the idea out of her head that he must have said something to lucilla before he went off to india and he had a way of asking about his cousin in his letters and though she would have done anything to secure her boy's happiness and was on the whole rather fond of her niece yet the idea of the objections her brotherinlaw would have to such a match excited to the uttermost the smouldering pride which existed in aunt jemima's heart
he was better off and had always been better off than her poor johnand he had robust health and an awful scorn of the coddling to which as he said she had subjected his brother and he had money enough to keep his child luxuriously and make her the leader of carlingford society while her poor boy had to go to india and put himself in the way of all kinds of unknown diseases and troubles
mrs john was profoundly anxious to promote her son's happiness and would gladly have given every penny she had to get him married to lucilla if that was what he wanted as she justly said but to have her brotherinlaw object to him and suggest that he was not good enough was the one thing she could not bear
she was thinking about this and whether tom really had not said anything and whether lucilla cared for him and what amid all these perplexities she should do while she dressed for dinner and at the same time she felt her palpitation worse than usual and knew dr marjoribanks would smile his grim smile if she complained so that her visit to grange lane though lucilla meant to take good care of her was not altogether unmingled delight to mrs john
but nevertheless dr marjoribanks's dinnertable was always a cheerful sight even when it was only a dinnerparty of three for then naturally they used the round table and were as snug as possible
lucilla wore her knot of green and violet ribbons on her white dress to her aunt's great amazement and the doctor had all the air of a man who had been out in the world all day and returned in the evening with something to tellwhich is a thing which gives great animation to a family party
mrs john marjoribanks had been out of all that sort of thing for a long time
she had been living quite alone in a widowed forlorn way and had half forgotten how pleasant it was to have somebody coming in with a breath of fresh air about him and the day's budget of newsand it had an animating effect upon her even though she was not fond of her brotherinlaw
dr marjoribanks inquired about tom in the most fatherly way and what he was about and how things were looking for him and whether he intended to come home
much better not the doctor saidi should certainly advise him not if he asked me
he has got over all the worst of it and now is his time to do something worth while
tom is not one to think merely of worldly advantages said his mother with a fine instinct of opposition
i don't think he would care to waste all the best part of his life making money
i'd rather see him come home and be happy for my part even if he were not so rich  if all men were happy that came home said the doctor and then he gave a rather grim chuckle
somebody has come home that you did not reckon on lucilla
i am sorry to spoil sport but i don't see how you are to get out of it
there is another address on the walls today besides that one of yours  oh i hope there will be six addresses
cried miss marjoribanks if we had it all our own way it would be no funa tory and a whig and adid you say radical aunt jemima
and then what is a conservative
asked lucilla though certainly she had a very much better notion of political matters than aunt jemima had to say the least
i wonder how you can encourage any poor man to go into parliament said mrs john so trying for the health as it must be and an end to everything like domestic life
if it was my tom i would almost rather he stayed in india
he looks strong but there is never any confidence to be put in young men looking strong
oh i know you do not agree with me doctor but i have had sad reason for my way of thinking said the poor lady
as for the doctor he did not accept the challenge thus thrown to him
tom marjoribanks was not the foremost figure in the world in his eyes as the absent wanderer was in that of his mother and he had not yet unburdened himself of what he had to say
i am not saying anything in favour of going into parliament said the doctor
i'd sooner be a bargeman on the canal if it was me
i am only telling lucilla what she has before her
i don't know when i have been more surprised
of course you were not looking for that said dr marjoribanks
he had kept back until the things were taken off the table for he had a benevolent disinclination to spoil anybody's dinner
now when all the serious part of the meal was over he tossed the carlingford gazette across the table folded so that she could not miss what he wanted her to see
lucilla took it up lightly between her finger and thumb for the carlingford papers were inky and badly printed and soiled a lady's hand
she took it up delicately without either alarm or surprise knowing very well that the blues and the yellows were not likely without a struggle to give up to the new standard which was violet and green
but what she saw on that inky broadsheet overwhelmed in an instant miss marjoribanks's selfpossession
she turned pale though her complexion was if possible fresher than ever and even shivered in her chair though her nerves were so steady
could it be a trick to thwart and startle her
or could it be true
she lifted her eyes to her father with a look of horrorstricken inquiry but all that she met in return was a certain air of amusement and triumph which struck her at the tenderest point
he was not sorry nor sympathetic nor did he care at all for the sudden shock she had sustained
on the contrary he was laughing within himself at the utterly unexpected complication
it was cruel but it was salutary and restored her selfcommand in a moment
she might have given way under kindness but this look of satisfaction over her discomfiture brought lucilla to herself
yes i thought you would be surprised said dr marjoribanks dryly and he took his first glass of claret with a slow relish and enjoyment which roused every sentiment of selfrespect and spark of temper existing in his daughter's mind
if you had kept your own place it would not have mattered but i don't see how you are to get out of it
you see young ladies should let these sort of things alone lucilla
this was all the feeling he showed for her in her unexpected dilemma
miss marjoribanks's heart gave one throb which made the green and violet ribbons jump and thrill and then she came to herself and recognised as she had so often done before that she had to fight her way by herself and had nobody to look to
such a thought is dreary enough sometimes and there are minds that sink under it but at other times it is like the touch of the mother earth which gave the giant back its strength and lucilla was of the latter class of intelligence
when she saw the triumph with which her embarrassment was received and that she had no sympathy nor aid to look for she recovered herself as if by magic
let what would come in the way nothing could alter her certainty that mr ashburton was the man for carlingford and that determination not to be beaten which is the soul of british valour sprang up in an instant in miss marjoribanks's mind
there was not even the alternative of victory or westminster abbey for lucilla
if she was ever to hold up her head again or have any real respect for herself she must win
all this passed through her head in the one bewildering moment while her father's words were still making her ears tingle and that name printed in big inky letters seemed to flutter in all the air round her
it was hard to believe the intelligence thus conveyed and harder still to go on in the face of old friendships and the traditions of her youth but still duty was dearer than tradition and it was now a necessity to fight the battle to the last and at all risks to win
thank you all the same papa for bringing me the paper said lucilla
it would have been a great deal worse if i had not known of it before i saw him
i am sure i am very glad for one thing
he can't be married or dead as people used to say
i am quite ashamed to keep you so long downstairs aunt jemima when i know you must be longing for a cup of teabut it is somebody come back whom nobody expected
tell him i shall be so glad to see him papa though i have no reason to be glad for he was one of my young friends you know and he is sure to think i have gone off
as she spoke lucilla turned aunt jemima to whom she had given her arm quite round that she might look into the great glass over the mantelpiece i don't think i am quite so much gone off as i expected to be said miss marjoribanks with candid impartiality though of course he will think me stouterbut it does not make any difference about mr ashburton being the right man for carlingford
she said the words with a certain solemnity and turned mrs john who was so much surprised as to be speechless round again and led her upstairs
it was as if they were walking in a procession of those martyrs and renouncers of self who build up the foundations of society and it would not be too much to say that under her present circumstances and in the excitement of this singular and unexpected event such was the painful but sublime consciousness which animated lucilla's breast
as for dr marjoribanks his triumph was taken out of him by that spectacle
he closed the door after the ladies had gone and came back to his easychair by the side of the fire and could not but feel that he had had the worst of it
it was actually mr cavendish who had come home and whose address to the electors of carlingford dated from dover on his return to england the doctor had just put into his daughter's hand
but wonderful and unlookedfor as was the event lucilla though taken unawares had not given in nor shown any signs of weakness
and the effect upon her father of her last utterance and confession was such that he took up the paper again and read both addresses which were printed side by side
in other days mr cavendish had been the chosen candidate of grange lane and the views which he expressed and he expressed his views very freely were precisely those of dr marjoribanks
yet when the doctor turned to mr ashburton's expression of his conviction that he was the right man for carlingford it cannot be denied that the force of that simple statement had a wonderful effect upon his mindan effect all the greater perhaps in comparison with the political exposition made by the other unexpected candidate
the doctor's meditations possibly took a slumbrous tone from the place and the moment at which he pursued them for the fact was that the words he had just been hearing ran in his head all through the reading of the two addresses
mr cavendish would think lucilla had gone off but yet she had not gone off so much as might have been expected and mr ashburton was the man for carlingford
dr marjoribanks laughed quietly by himself in his easychair and then went back to mr cavendish's opinions and ended again without knowing it in a kind of odd incipient agreement with lucilla
the new candidate was right in politics but after all mr ashburton was a more satisfactory sort of person
he was a man whom people knew everything about and a descendant of old penrhyn and had the firs and lived in it and spent about so much money every year honestly in the face of the world
when a man conducts himself in this way his neighbours can afford to be less exacting as to his political opinions
this comparison went on in the doctor's thoughts until the distinction between the two grew confused and faint in that ruddy and genial glow of firelight and lamplight and personal wellbeing which is apt to engross a man's mind after he has come in out of the air as people say and has eaten a good dinner and feels himself comfortable and at last all that remained in dr marjoribanks's mind was that mr cavendish would think lucilla had gone off though she had not gone off nearly so much as might have been expected at which he laughed with an odd sound which roused him and might have induced some people to think he had been sleepingif indeed anybody had been near to hear
but this news was naturally much more serious to miss marjoribanks when she got upstairs and had time to think of it
she would not have been human if she had heard without emotion of the return of the man whom she had once dreamed of as member for carlingford with the addition of other dreams which had not been altogether without their sweetness
he had returned now and then for a few days but lucilla knew that he had never held up his head in grange lane since the day when she advised him to marry barbara lake
and now when he had bethought himself of his old ambition had he possibly bethought himself of other hopes as well
and the horrible thing was that she had pledged herself to another and put her seal upon it that mr ashburton was the man for carlingford
it may be supposed that with such a complication in her mind miss marjoribanks was very little capable of supporting aunt jemima's questions as to what it was about and who was mr cavendish and why was his return of consequence to lucilla
mrs john was considerably alarmed and startled and began to think in earnest that tom was fond of his cousin and would never forgive his mother for letting lucilla perhaps marry some one else and settle down before her very eyes
if it is a very particular friend i can understand it mrs john said with a little asperity but that was after she had made a great many attempts which were only partially successful to find it all out
dear aunt jemima said lucilla we are all particular friends in carlingfordsociety is so limited you knowand mr cavendish has been a very long time away
he used to be of such use to me and i am so fond of him miss marjoribanks said with a sigh and it may be supposed that mrs john's curiosity was not lessened by such a response
if you are engaged to any one lucilla i must say i think i ought to have been told said tom's mother with natural indignation
though i ought not to blame you for it perhaps
it is a sad thing when a girl is deprived of a mother's care but still i am your nearest relation  my dear aunt it is something about the election said miss marjoribanks
how could i be engaged to a man who has been away ten years
tom has been away ten years said mrs john impetuously and then she blushed though she was past the age of blushing and made haste to cover her imprudence
i don't see what you can have to do with the election she said with suspicion but some justice and i don't feel lucilla as if you were telling me all
i have the favours to make aunt jemima said lucillagreen and violet
you used to be so clever at making bows and i hope you will help mepapa you know will have to be on mr ashburton's committee miss marjoribanks added and then in spite of herself a sigh of doubt and anxiety escaped her bosom
it was easy to say that papa would be on mr ashburton's committee you know but nobody had known that mr cavendish was coming to drive everything topsyturvy and lucilla though she professed to know only who was the man for carlingford had at the same time sufficient political information to be aware that the sentiments propounded in mr cavendish's address were also dr marjoribanks's sentiments and she did not know the tricks which some greenandviolet spirit in the diningroom was playing with the doctor's fancy
perhaps it might turn out to be mr cavendish's committee which her father would be on and after she had pledged herself that the other man was the man for carlingford
lucilla felt that she could not be disloyal and go back from her word neither could she forget the intimation which had so plainly indicated to her that mr ashburton was the man and yet at the same time she could not but sigh as she thought of mr cavendish
perhaps he had grown coarse as men do at that age just as lucilla herself was conscious that he would find her stouter
perhaps he had ceased to flirt or be of any particular use of an evening possibly even he might have forgotten miss marjoribanksbut naturally that was a thing that seemed unlikely to lucilla
and oh
if he had but come a little earlier or for ever stayed away
but while all these thoughts were going through her mind her fingers were still busy with the violetandgreen cockades which aunt jemima after making sure that mr ashburton was not a radical had begun to help her with
and they sat and talked about mrs john's breathing which was so bad and about her headaches while lucilla by snatches discussed the situation in her mind
perhaps on the whole embarrassment and perplexity are a kind of natural accompaniment to life and movement and it is better to be driven out of your senses with thinking which of two things you ought to do than to do nothing whatever and be utterly uninteresting to all the world
this at least was how lucilla reasoned to herself in her dilemma and while she reasoned she used up yard upon yard of her green ribbon for naturally the violet bore but a small proportion to the green
whatever she might have to do or to sufferhowever her thoughts might be disturbed or her heart distractedit is unnecessary to add that it was impossible to lucilla either to betray or to yield
chapter xxxix   it was a very good thing for lucilla that mrs john was so much of an invalid notwithstanding that the doctor made little of her complaints
all that dr marjoribanks said waswith that remnant of scotch which was often perceptible in his speechthat her illnesses were a fine thing to occupy her and he did not know what she would do without thema manner of speaking which naturally lessened his daughter's anxiety though her sympathetic care and solicitude were undiminished
and no doubt when she had been once assured that there was nothing dangerous in her aunt's case it was a relief to miss marjoribanks at the present juncture that mrs john got up late and always breakfasted in her own room
lucilla went into that sanctuary after she had given her father his breakfast and heard all about the palpitation and the bad night aunt jemima had passed and then when she had consoled her suffering relative by the reflection that one never sleeps well the first night or two miss marjoribanks was at liberty to go forth and attend a little to her own affairs which stood so much in need of being attended to
she had had no further talk with the doctor on the subject but she had read over mr cavendish's address and could not help seeing that it went dead against her candidate neither could lucilla remain altogether unaffected by the expression of feeling in respect to a place in which i have spent so many pleasant years and which has so many claims on my affections and the touching haste with which the exile had rushed back as soon as he heard of the old member's death
if it touched miss marjoribanks who was already pledged to support another interest what might it not do to the gentlemen in grange lane who were not pledged and who had a friendship for mr cavendish
this was the alarming thought that had disturbed her sleep all night and returned to her mind with her first awakening and when she had really her time to herself and the fresh morning hours before her lucilla began as everybody ought to do by going to the very root and foundation and asking herself what beyond all secondary considerations it was right to do
to change from one side to the other and go back from her word was a thing abhorrent to her but still miss marjoribanks was aware that there are certain circumstances in which honesty and truth themselves demand what in most cases is considered an untruthful and dishonest proceeding
thus in order to come to a right decision and with a sense of the duty she owed to her country which would have shamed half the electors in england not to say carlingford lucilla who naturally had no vote read the two addresses of the two candidates and addressed herself candidly and impartially to the rights of the subject
mr cavendish was disposed as we have said to be pathetic and sentimental and to speak of the claims the borough had upon his affections and the eagerness with which he had rushed home at the earliest possible moment to present himself to them
if poor old mr chiltern had been king bomba or a gloomy oriental tyrant keeping all possible reformers and successors banished from his dominions the new candidate could not have spoken with more pathos
it was a sort of thing which tells among the imaginative part of the community or so at least most people think and miss marjoribanks was moved by it for the first moment but then her enlightened mind asserted its rights
she said to herself that mr cavendish might have come home at any hour by any steamboat that calais and boulogne and even dieppe were as open to him as if he had been an actual refugee and that consequently there was nothing particular to be pathetic about
and then if the town had such claims on his affections why had he stayed so long away
these two rationalistic questions dispersed the first attendrissement which had begun to steal over lucilla's mind
when she came to this conclusion her difficulties cleared away
she had no reason to go back from her engagements and reject that intimation which had so impressed it on her that mr ashburton was the man
it was a sacrifice which ancient truth and friendship did not demand for verity was not in the document she had just been reading and that appeal to sentiment was nothing more than what is generally called humbug
he might have been living here all the time lucilla said to herself he might have had much stronger claims upon our affections if he had wanted he might have come back ages ago and not let people struggle on alone
when this view of the subject occurred to her lucilla felt more indignation than sympathy
and then as dr marjoribanks had done she turned to the calm utterance of her own candidatethe man who was the only man for carlingfordand that sweet sense of having given sound counsel and of having at last met with some one capable of carrying it out which makes up for so many failures came like balm to lucilla's bosom
there was nothing more necessary the commotion in her mind calmed down and the tranquillity of undisturbed conviction came in its place
and it was with this sense of certainty that she put on her bonnet and issued forth though it snowed a little and was a very wintry day on mr ashburton's behalf to try her fortune in grange lane
she went to mrs chiley's who was now very old poor old lady
and feeble and did not like to leave her sofa
not but what she could leave the sofa she said to her friends but at that time of the year and at her time of life it was comfortable
the sofa was wheeled to the side of the fire and mrs chiley reclined upon it covered with knitted rugs of the brightest colours which her young friends all worked for her
the last one arrived was what used to be called an afghanistan blanket done in stripes of all sorts of pretty tints which was a present from mrs beverley
her work she says lucilla said the old lady but we know what sort of soft dawdling woman she is and it must have been the archdeacon's nieces you know
but still it had the place of honour at present covering mrs chiley's feet and affording something to talk about when any one came in
and by her side was a little table upon which stood one china rose in a glass of watera pale rose almost as pale as her soft old cheeks and chilled like them by the approaching frost
and the fire burned with an officious cheerfulness at her elbow as if it thought nothing of such accidental circumstances as winter and old age
to be sure this was a reflection which never came into mrs chiley's head who was on the contrary very thankful for the fire and said it was like a companion
and i often think my dear how do the poor people get on especially if they are old and sick they have no fires to keep them cheerful in this dreadful weather the kind old lady would say
she did say so now when lucilla came in glowing with cold and her rapid walk and with a flake or two of snow slowly melting on her sealskin cloak
perhaps it was not a sentiment the colonel agreed with for he gave a humph and a little hoist of his shoulders as if in protest being himself a good deal limited in his movements and not liking to own it by the wintry torpor within his big old frame and the wintry weather outside
come and tell us all the news lucilla my darling mrs chiley said as she drew down her young friend's glowing face to her own and gave her one of her lingering kisses i felt sure you would come and tell us everything
i said it would not be like lucilla if she didn't
we know nothing but the fact you knownot another word
make haste and tell us everything my dear
but i don't know anything said miss marjoribanks
of course you mean about mr cavendish
i saw it in the papers like everybody else but i don't know anything more
and then mrs chiley's countenance fell
she was not very strong poor old lady and she could have cried as she said afterwards
ah well i suppose there is not time she said after a little pause i suppose he has not got here from dover yetone always forgets the distance
i calculated it all over last night and i thought he would get home by the eleven train but these trains are never to be calculated upon you know my dear
i am a little disappointed lucilla
poor dear
to think how he must have rushed home the first momenti could have cried when i read that address
i don't see why any one should cry said lucilla
i think he makes a great deal too much of that he might have come ever so many years ago if he had liked
poor mr chiltern did not banish him poor old manhe might have been here for years
upon which the colonel himself drew a little nearer and poked the fire
i am glad to see you are so sensible lucilla he said
it's the first rational word i have heard on the subject
she thinks he's a kind of saint and martyr a silly young fellow that runs off among a set of frenchmen because he can't get everything his own wayand then he expects that we are all to go into transports of joy and give him our votes colonel chiley added smashing a great piece of coal with the poker with a blow full of energy yet showing a slight unsteadiness in it which sent a host of blazing splinters into the hearth
he was a man who wore very well but he was not so steady as he once was and nowadays was apt by some tremulous movement to neutralise the strength which he had left
mrs chiley for her part was apt to be made very nervous by her husband's proceedings
she was possessed by a terror that the splinters some day would jump out of the hearth on to the carpet and fly into the corners and perhaps burn us all up in our beds as she said
she gave a little start among her cushions and stooped down to look over the floor
he will never learn that he is old she said in lucilla's ear who instantly came to her side to see what she wanted and thus the two old people kept watch upon each other and noted with a curious mixture of vexation and sympathy each other's declining strength
for my part i would give him all my votes if i had a hundred said mrs chiley and so will you too when you hear the rights of it
lucilla my dear tell himi hope you are not going to forsake old friends
no said miss marjoribanksbut she spoke with a gravity and hesitation which did not fail to reach mrs chiley's eari hope i shall never desert my old friends but i think all the same that it is mr ashburton who is the right man for carlingford she said slowly
she said it with reluctance for she knew it would shock her audience but at the same time she did not shrink from her duty and the moment had now arrived when lucilla felt concealment was impossible and that the truth must be said
as for mrs chiley she was so distressed that the tears came to her eyes and even the colonel laughed and did not understand it
colonel chiley though he was by no means as yet on mr cavendish's side was not any more capable than his neighbours of understanding miss marjoribanks's singleminded devotion to what was just and right and why she should transfer her support to ashburton who was not a ladies' man nor in the colonel's opinion a marrying man nor anything at all attractive now that the other had come back romantic and repentant to throw his honours at her feet was beyond his power of explanation
he contented himself with saying humph but his wife was not so easily satisfied
she took lucilla by the hand and poured forth a flood of remonstrances and prayers
i do not understand you lucilla said mrs chiley
he whom we know so little aboutwhom i am sure you have no reason to care for
and where could you find anybody nicer than mr cavendishand he to have such faith in us and to come rushing back as soon as he was able
i am sure you have not taken everything into consideration lucilla
he might not perhaps do exactly as could have been wished before he went away but he was young and he was led astray and i do think you were a little hard upon him my dear but i have always said i never knew anybody nicer than mr cavendish
and what possible reason you can have to care about that other man  it was like a special intimation said lucilla with solemnity
i don't see how i could neglect it for my part
the day the news came about poor old mr chiltern's death i was out you know and heard it and just at one spot upon the pavement opposite mr holden's it came into my mind like a flash of lightning that mr ashburton was the man
i don't care in the least for him and i had not been thinking of him or anything
it came into my head all in a moment
if i had been very intimate with poor dear old mr chiltern or if i believed in spiritrapping i should think it was a message from him
lucilla spoke with great gravity but she did not impress her audience who were people of sceptical minds
mrs chiley for her part was almost angry and could scarcely forgive lucilla for having made her give grave attention to such a piece of nonsense
if it had been him she said with some wrath i don't see how having been dead for a few hours should make his advice worth having
it never was good for anything when he was alive
and you don't believe in spiritrapping i hope
i wonder how you can talk such nonsense the old lady said severely
and colonel chiley who had been a little curious too laughed and coughed over the joke for the two old people were of the old school and of a very unbelieving frame of mind
i knew you would laugh said miss marjoribanks but i cannot help it
if it had been impressed upon your mind like that you would have been different
and of course i like mr cavendish much the best
i am so glad i have no vote said lucilla it does not matter to anybody what i think but if i had anything to do with it you know i could not stand up for mr cavendish even though i am fond of him when i felt sure that mr ashburton is the man for carlingfordnobody could ask me to do that
there followed a pause upon this declaration for miss marjoribanks though she had no vote was a person of undoubted influence and such a conviction on her part was not to be laughed at
even colonel chiley who was undecided in his own mind was moved by it a little
what does the doctor think
he asked
ashburton doesn't say a word about his principles that i can see and the other you know  dear colonel chiley cried lucilla he is not going to be prime minister and i have always heard you say as long as i can remember that it was not opinions you know but a good man that people wanted
i have heard people talking politics for hours and i always remember you saying that and thinking it was the only sensible thing that was said but of course i don't understand politics lucilla added with humility
as for the colonel he took up the poker perhaps to hide a little pleasant confusion and again drew near the fire
by george
i believe lucilla is in the right he said with a certain agreeable consciousness
perhaps he did not quite recollect at what moment of his life he had originated that sentiment but he thought he could recollect having said it and it was with the view of carrying off the bashfulness of genius and not because the coals had any need of it that he took up the pokera proceeding which was always regarded with alarm and suspicion by his wife
the fire is very nice said mrs chiley
i hate to have the fire poked when it does not want it
lucilla if you make him go over to that mr ashburton's side you will have a great deal to answer for and i will never forgive you
my dear you must be dreaminga man that is as dry as a stick and not onehundredth nor onethousandth part so nice  i shan't say another word said lucilla i shan't stay any longer for i can't help it and you would be angry with me
people can't help what they believe you know
there is poor little oswald brown who has doubts and can't go into the church and will ruin all his prospects and nobody can help it  if i were his mother i should help it
cried mrs chiley
i promise you he should not talk of his doubts to me
a bit of a lad and what is good enough for all the bishops and everybody in their senses is not good enough for him
if that is the kind of example you are going to follow lucilla  dear mrs chiley said miss marjoribanks everybody knows what my church principles are and perhaps you will come round to think with me but i am not going to say any more about it now
i am so glad your rheumatism is better this morning but you must wrap up well for it is so cold oh so cold out of doors
when lucilla had thus dismissed the subject she came to her old friend's side and bent over her in her sealskin cloak to say goodbye
mrs chiley took her by both hands as she thus stood with her back to the old colonel and drew her down close and looked searchingly into her eyes
if you have any particular reason lucilla you ought to tell methat would make such a difference said the old lady
i always tell you everything said miss marjoribanks with evasive fondness as she kissed the soft old withered cheek and naturally with the colonel behind who was standing up before the fire shadowing over them both and quite unaware of this little whispered episode it would have been impossible to say more had there been ever so much to say
but it had been a close encounter in its way and lucilla was rather glad to get off without any further damage
she did not feel quite successful as she went out but still she had left a very wholesome commotion behind her for colonel chiley could not but feel that the sentiment which she had quoted from himself was a very just sentiment
by george
lucilla was in the right of it he said again after she was gone and in fact went through a process very similar to that which had modified the sentiments of dr marjoribanks on the previous night
mr cavendish was a young fellow who had rushed off among a set of frenchmen because lucilla marjoribanks would not have him or because he could not marry barbara lake in addition or at least somehow because he failed of having his own way
it was all very well for him to come back and make a commotion and be sentimental about it
but what if after all ashburton who had the firs and lived there and spent his money like a christian was the man for carlingford
the colonel's mind still wavered and veered about yet it had received an impulse which was by no means unworthy of consideration
as for mrs chiley she laid back her head upon her pillows and painfully questioned with herself whether lucilla could have any particular reason for taking mr ashburton's part so warmly
she thought with justice that miss marjoribanks was looking brighter and better and had more of her old animation than she had shown for a long timewhich arose from the simple fact that she had something in hand though the old lady thought it might have a more touching and delicate motive
if that was the case it would make a great difference
mrs chiley was no longer able to go out in the evening and had to be dependent on other people's observation for a knowledge of what happenedand she was wounded by a sense that her young friend had not been appreciated as her worth deserved
if mr ashburton had the sense to see what was for his own advantage it would be a frightful thing as mrs chiley said to herself if lucilla's friends should fly in his face
and though it was a hard trial to give up mr cavendish still if anything of the kind had happenedthus it will be evident that lucilla's visit though it was not a long one nor the least in the world an argumentative visit was not without its fruit
she went up grange lane again cheerful and warm in her sealskin coat
it was a thing that suited her remarkably well and corresponded with her character and everybody knows how comfortable they are
the snowflakes fell softly one at a time and melted away to nothing upon her sleeves and her shoulders without leaving any traceand lucilla with the chill air blowing in her face and those feathery messengers in the air could not but feel that her walk and the general readiness which she felt to face all kinds of objections and difficulties and to make a sacrifice of her own feelings had in them a certain magnanimous and heroic element
for after all she had no particular reason as mrs chiley said
mr ashburton was a dry man and of very little use in a social point of view and had never paid her any attention to speak of nor at all put himself forth as a candidate for her favour
if he had done so she would not have felt that thrill of utter disinterestedness which kept her as warm within as her sealskin did without
there was not a soul to be seen in grange lane at that moment in the snow which came on faster and faster but one of mr wentworth's who at that time was new in st roque's gray sisters and another lady who was coming down as quickly as lucilla was going up by the long line of garden walls
the gentlemen were either at business or at their club or keeping themselves snug indoors and it was only these devoted women who braved the elements outside
the figure in the gray cloak was occupied simply with the poor people and that is not our present business but the other two were otherwise inspired
mr cavendish who had lately arrived had not been able to make up his mind to face the weather but his sister was of a different way of thinking
she was not of half the capacity of lucilla but still she felt that something ought to be done and that there was not a moment to be lost
when she saw it was miss marjoribanks that was advancing to meet her a momentary chill came over mrs woodburn
she was thinking so much of her own errand that she could not but jump at the idea that nothing less important could have induced lucilla to be out of doors on such a day and her heart beat loud as the two drew near each other
was it an unexpected and generous auxiliary or was it a foe accomplished and formidable
for one thing she was not coming out of mr centum's where mrs woodburn herself was going which at least was a relief
as they came nearer the two ladies instinctively looked to their weapons
they had met already in many a little passage of arms but nothing like this had ever occurred to them before
if they were to work in union mrs woodburn felt that they would carry all before them and if not then it must be a struggle unto the death
is it really you lucilla
she said i could not believe my eyes
what can have brought you out of doors on such a day
you that have everything your own way and no call to exert yourself  i have been to see mrs chiley said lucilla sweetly when the weather is bad she sees nobody and she is always so pleased to have me
her rheumatism is not so bad thank youthough i am sure if this weather should last  you would see mrs beverley's blanket said mrs woodburn who was a little nervous though perhaps that might only be the cold but we know what sort of woman she is and it must have been the archdeacon's nieces my dear
do turn back with me a moment lucilla or i shall go with you
i want to speak to you
of course you have heard of harry's coming home
i saw it in the papers said miss marjoribanks whose perfect serenity offered a curious contrast to her companion's agitation
i am sure i shall be very glad to see him again
i hope he will come to dinner on thursday as he used to do
it will be quite nice to see him in his old place
yes said mrs woodburn but that was not what i was thinking of
you know you used always to say he ought to be in parliament and he has always kept thinking of it since he went awayand thinking i am sure that it would please you said the poor woman faltering for lucilla listened with a smile that was quite unresponsive and did not change countenance in the least even at this tender suggestion
he has come home with that object now you know now that poor old mr chiltern is dead and i hope you are going to help us lucilla said mrs woodburn
her voice quite vibrated with agitation as she made this hurried perhaps injudicious appeal thinking within herself at the same moment what would harry say if he knew that she was thus committing him
as for lucilla she received it all with the same tranquillity as if she expected it and was quite prepared for everything that her assailant had to say
i am sure i wish i had a vote said lucilla but i have no vote and what can a girl do
i am so sorry i don't understand politics
if we were going in for that sort of thing i don't know what there would be left for the gentlemen to do
you have influence which is a great deal better than a vote said mrs woodburn and they all say there is nobody like a lady for electioneeringand a young lady above all and then you know harry so well and can always draw him out to the best advantage
i never thought he looked so nice or showed his talents so much as when he was with you said the eager advocate
she was only wrapped in a shawl herself and when she looked at lucilla's sealskin coat and saw how rosy and comfortable she looked and how serene and immovable poor mrs woodburn was struck with a pang of envy
if miss marjoribanks had married ten years ago it might have been she now who would have had to stand trembling with anxiety and eagerness among the falling snow knowing sundry reasons why mr cavendish should be disposed to go into parliament more substantial than that of gratifying a young lady and feeling how much depended on her ability to secure support for him
this as it happened had fallen to his sister's share instead and lucilla stood opposite to her looking at her attentive and polite and unresponsive
if harry had only not been such a fool ten years ago
for mrs woodburn began to think now with aunt jemima that lucilla did not marry because she was too comfortable and without any of the bother could have everything her own way
it is so cold said miss marjoribanks and i do think it is coming on to snow very fast
i don't think it is good to stand talking
do come in to lunch and then we can have a long chat for i am sure nobody else will venture out today
i wish i could come said mrs woodburn but i have to go down to mary centum's and hear all about her last new housemaid you know
i don't know what servants are made of for my part
they will go out in their caps and talk to the young men you know in a night that is enough to give any one their death the mimic added with a feeble exercise of her gift which it was sad to see
but harry will be sure to come to call the first time he goes out and you will not forget what i have said to you lucilla
and with this mrs woodburn took her young friend's hand and looked in her face with a pathetic emphasis which it would be impossible to describe
oh no certainly not said miss marjoribanks with cheerful certainty and then they kissed each other in the midst of the falling snow
mrs woodburn's face was cold but lucilla's cheek was warm and blooming as only a clear conscience and a sealskin cloak could have made it and then they went their several ways through the wintry solitude
ah if harry had only not been such a fool ten years ago
mrs woodburn was not an enthusiastic young wife but knew very well that marriage had its drawbacks and had come to an age at which she could appreciate the comfort of having her own way without any of the bother
she gave a furtive glance after lucilla and could not but acknowledge to herself that it would be very foolish of miss marjoribanks to marry and forfeit all her advantages and take somebody else's anxieties upon her shoulders and never have any money except what she asked from her husband
mrs chiley to be sure who was more experienced than mrs woodburn and might have been her grandmother took a different view of the subject but this was what the middleaged married woman felt who had as may be said two men to carry on her shoulders as she went anxiously down grange lane to conciliate mrs centum wrapping her shawl about her and feeling the light snow melt beneath her feet and the cold and discomfort go to her heart
she had her husband to keep in good humour and her brother to keep up and keep to the mark and to do what she could to remedy in public the effects of his indolent continental habits and carry if it was possible the election for himall with the horrid sense upon her mind that if at any time the dinner should be a little less cared for than usual or the children more noisy woodburn would go on like a savage
under such circumstances the poor woman amid her cares may be excused if she looked back a little wistfully at lucilla going home all comfortable and independent and lighthearted with no cares nor anybody to go on at her in her sealskin coat
this was how lucilla commenced that effective but decorous advocacy which did mr ashburton so much good in carlingford
she did not pretend to understand about politics or to care particularly about reform or the incometax but she expressed with quiet solemnity her conviction that it was not opinions but a good man that was wanted that it was not a prime minister they were going to elect and that mr ashburton was the man for carlingford
by george
lucilla is in the right of it
colonel chiley said that was always my opinion and the people in grange lane soon began to echo the colonel's sentiments which were so sound and so just
as for miss marjoribanks nobody had any occasion to go on about any neglect on her part of her household duties
dr marjoribanks's dinners were always excellent and it was now as ever a privilege to be admitted to his table and nothing could be more exemplary than the care lucilla took of aunt jemima who had always such bad nights
even on this snowy afternoon she went in from her more important cares with a complexion freshened by the cold and coaxed mrs john into eating something and made her as comfortable as possible at the drawingroom fireside
now tell me all about tom lucilla said when she had got her work and settled herself comfortably for a quiet afternoonfor the snow had come on heavier than ever and unless it might be a sister of charity or such another sister not of charity as lucilla had already encountered nobody was like to stir abroad or to disturb the two ladies in their work and their talk
lucilla had some very interesting worstedwork in hand and the drawingroom never looked more cosy with somebody to talk to inside and the wintry world and driving snow without
and such an invitation as miss marjoribanks had just given lifted aunt jemima into a paradise of content
she took lucilla at her word and told her as may be supposed all about tom including many things which she was quite acquainted with and knew by heart and at the same time there was something implied all through but never obtrusively set forth which was not displeasing to the auditor
miss marjoribanks listened with affectionate satisfaction and asked a great many questions and supplied a great many reminiscences and entered quite into the spirit of the conversation and the two spent a very pleasant afternoon togetherso pleasant that mrs john felt quite annoyed at the reflection that it must come to an end like everything else that is good and that she must get herself once more into her velvet gown and dine with her brotherinlaw
if providence had only given her the girl instead of the doctor who would no doubt have got on quite well without any children
but then to be sure if lucilla had been hers to start with she never could have married tom
for this was the extravagant hope which had already begun to blossom in his mother's breast
to be sure a woman might marry tom who was too comfortable at home to think of marrying just anybody who might make her an offer
but it was not easy to tell how lucilla herself felt on this subject
her complexion was so bright with her walk her sensations so agreeable after that warm cheerful pleasant afternoon her position so entirely everything that was to be desired and her mind so nobly conscious of being useful to her kind and country that even without any additional argument miss marjoribanks had her reward and was happy
perhaps a touch more exquisite might still come in to round the full proportions of content
but to tell the truth lucilla was so well off that it was not necessary to invent any romantic source of happiness to account for the light of wellbeing and satisfaction that shone in her eyes
chapter xl   the result of miss marjoribanks's wise precaution and reticence was that sir john richmond and the doctor and colonel chiley were all on mr ashburton's committee
they might not agree with his principles but then when a man does not state any very distinct principles it is difficult for any one however well disposed to disagree with him and the fact that he was the man for carlingford was so indisputable that nobody attempted to go into the minor matters
mr ashburton is a gentleman known to us all sir john said with great effect in his nomination speech and it was a sentence which went to the hearts of his audience
the other candidate had been a long time from home and it was longer still since anybody in carlingford could be said to have benefited by his residence there
he had had all his things down from town as mr holden the upholsterer pithily remarkedand that made a great difference to start with
as for mr ashburton though it is true nobody knew what he thought about reform or the incometax everybody knew that he lived at the firs and was supplied in a creditable way by george street tradesmen
there was no mystery whatever about him
people knew how much he had a year and how much he paid for everything and the way in which his accounts were kept and all about him
even when he had his wine direct from the growers for naturally his own county could not supply the actual liquor it was put in carlingford bottles and people knew the kinds he had and how much and a hundred agreeable details
and then he was a gentleman as was always ready to give his advice as some of the people said
all this furnished an immense body of evidence in his favour and made sir john's remark eloquent
and then carlingford as a general rule did not care the least in the world about reform
there were a few people who had once done so and it was remarked in grove street that mr tozer had once been in a dreadful state of mind about it
but he was quite tranquil on the subject now and so was the community in general
and what was really wanted as lucilla's genius had seen at a glance was not this or that opinion but a good man
but at the same time it would be vain to deny that miss marjoribanks looked forward to a possible visit from mr cavendish with a certain amount of anxiety
she was not frightened for she knew her own powers but she was a little excited and stimulated by the idea that he might come in at any minute bringing back a crowd of recollections with him and it was a perpetual wonder to her how he would take the inevitable difference whether he would accept it as natural or put on the airs of an injured man
lucilla did not go out the two afternoons after her meeting with mrs woodburn partly that she might not miss him if he calledfor it was better to have it over but mr cavendish did not come on either of these days
after that of course she did not wait for him any longer
but on the third or fourth day when she was in miss brown's photographing room the eldest miss brown was not married and was a mother to the younger girls and always enthusiastic about sitters mr ashburton called about business and thomas came to fetch miss marjoribanks
she was sitting with the greatest goodnature for half a dozen pictures knowing in her secret heart all the time that she would look a perfect fright and that all carlingford would see her grinning with imbecile amiability out of the hazy background of miss brown's cartes
lucilla knew this and had hitherto avoided the process with success but now she gave in and as the major was there of course they talked of the coming election which indeed at present was almost the only topic of conversation in grange lane
of course you are on mr ashburton's committee said lucilla you must be or going to be after what you said the other day at lunch  what did i say
asked major brown with an air of dismay for to tell the truth his heart inclined a little towards poor mr cavendish who was an old neighbour and to whom major brown could not but think the marjoribanks and others had behaved rather cruelly
but then in these electioneering matters one never knows what one may have done to compromise oneself without meaning it and the major was a little anxious to find out what he had said
dear major brown said lucilla seriously i am so sorry if you did not mean it
i am sure it was that as much as anything that influenced mr ashburton
he was turning it all over in his mind you know and was afraid the people he most esteemed in carlingford would not agree with him and did not know what to do and then you said what did it matter about opinions if it was a good manthat was what decided him said miss marjoribanks with sad yet gentle reproachfulness
i am so sorry if you did not mean what you said  good heavens
i don't remember saying anything of the sort said major brown
ii am sure i never thought of influencing anybody
it is true enough about a good man you know but if i had imagined for an instant that any one was paying attentionby george
it was you that said it lucillai remember now
please don't make fun of me said miss marjoribanks as if anybody cared what i say about politics
but i know that was what decided poor mr ashburton
indeed he told me so and when he finds you did not mean anything  but good heavensii did mean something cried the accused with dismay
and he grew quite inarticulate in his confusion and red in the face and lost his head altogether while lucilla sat calmly looking on with that air of virtue at once severe and indulgent which pities and blames and hopes that perhaps there is not so much harm done as might have been expected
this was the position of affairs when thomas came to say that miss marjoribanks was wanted as she had told him to do when her candidate came for to be sure it was only next door
it was terrible to hear the soft sigh she gave when she shook hands with major brown
i hope he will not feel it so much as i think but i should be afraid to tell him said lucilla and she went away leaving the good man in a state of bewilderment and embarrassment and doubt which would have been much more unpleasant if he had not felt so flattered at the same time
i never meant to influence anybody i am sure
he said with a comical mixture of complacence and dismay when lucilla was gone
i have always said papa that you don't think enough of the weight people give to your opinion miss brown replied as she gave the final bath to her negatives and they both left off work with a certain glow of comforted amour propre and the most benevolent sentiments towards mr ashburton who to tell the truth until he got his lesson from miss marjoribanks had never once thought about the opinion of major brown
he was sitting with aunt jemima when lucilla came in and talking to her in a steady sort of a way
nothing could have made mr ashburton socially attractive but still there are many people to whom this steady sort of talk is more agreeable than brilliancy
when a man is brilliant there is always a doubt in some minds whether he is trustworthy or sincere or to be relied upon but an ordinary commonsense sort of talker is free from such suspicion
mr ashburton was very sorry to hear that mrs john marjoribanks had bad nights and suggested that it might be nervousness and hoped that the air of carlingford would do her good and was very glad to hear that her son was getting on so well in india and aunt jemima could not help approving of him and feeling that he was a person of substance and reflection and not one of those flyaway young men who turn girls' heads and never mean anything
lucilla herself gained something in mrs john's eyes from mr ashburton's high opinion but at the same time it was quite clear that he was not thinking of anything sentimental but was quite occupied about his election as a man of sense should be
lucilla came in with a fine bloom on her cheeks but still with a shade of that sadness which had had so great an effect upon major brown
she had taken off her hat before she came in and dropped into her chair with an air of languor and fatigue which was quite unusual to her
it makes such a difference in life when one has something on one's mind said lucilla and she sighed as was but natural for though that did not affect the energy of her proceedings she knew and remembered at moments of discouragement how seldom one's most disinterested exertions are appreciated at the end
you want your lunch my dear said mrs john
perhaps i do said miss marjoribanks with a mournful affectionate smile
i have been sitting to maria brown
she has taken six and i am sure they are every one more hideous than the other and they will go all over england you know for the browns have hosts of people belonging to them and everybody will say 'so that is miss marjoribanks'
i don't think i am vain to speak of said lucilla but that sort of thing goes to one's heart
these amateurs are terrible people said mr ashburton in his steady way and photographs are a regular nuisance
for my part  don't say that said miss marjoribanks
i know what you are going to say and you must sit to her please
i have said already she must do one of you and i will tell you presently about the major
but wait and talk to aunt jemima a little for i am so tired said lucilla
she was lying back negligently in her seat with that air of languor which so many young ladies excel in but which was for her a novel indulgence
her hand hung over the arm of her chair as if there was no longer any force in it
her head fell back her eyes were half closed it was a moment of abandonment to her sensations such as a highprincipled young woman like miss marjoribanks seldom gives way to
but lucilla went into it conscientiously as into everything she did that she might regain her strength for the necessary duties that were before her
and it was at this moment that thomas appeared at the door with a suspicion of a grin appearing at the corners of his sober mouth and announced mr cavendish who came in before an ordinary woman would have had time to open her eyes
this was the moment he had chosen for his first visit and yet it was not he who had chosen it but fate who seemed to have in this respect a spite against lucilla
it was not only the embarrassing presence of his rival but the fact that neither of the two people in the room knew or had ever seen mr cavendish that put a climax to the horror of the situation
she alone knew him and had to take upon herself to present and introduce him and bridge over for him the long interval of absence and all this with the sense of being in the enemy's interest and to a certain extent false to mr cavendish
lucilla rose at once but she was not a woman to make pretences
she did not throw off all in a moment her fatigue and dash into spasmodic action
she held out her hand silently to mr cavendish with a look which spoke only affectionate satisfaction in a friend's return
she did not even speak at all for the first moment but contented herself with a look which indeed if he had been younger and less preoccupied would no doubt have touched his very heart
so you have really come back she said
i am so glad
after all that people said about your being married and dead and ever so many stupid things
oh
don't look at me please
it doesn't matter with a gentleman but i know as well as if you had told me that you think me dreadfully gone off  i entertain such a profane idea
said mr cavendish but he was considerably embarrassed and he was a great deal stouter and altogether different from what he used to be and he had not the light hand of his youth for a compliment
and then he sat down on the chair thomas had given him and he looked uncomfortable to say the least of it and he was getting large in dimensions and a little red in the face and had by no means the air of thinking that it didn't matter for a gentleman
as for miss marjoribanks it would be impossible to say what mists of illusion dropped away from her mind at the sight of him
even while she smiled upon the newcomer she could not but ask herself with momentary dismayhad she really gone off as much in the same time
i have been looking for you miss marjoribanks resumed i waited in for you tuesday and wednesday and it is so odd you should have come just at this minute
aunt jemima this is mr cavendish whom you have heard so much aboutand don't go please mr ashburtonyou two must know each other
you will be hearing of each other constantly and i suppose you will have to shake hands or something on the hustingsso it will be much the best to begin it here
but the two candidates did not shake hands they bowed to each other in an alarming way which did not promise much for their future brotherliness and then they both stood bolt upright and stared at miss marjoribanks who had relapsed in the pleasantest way in the world into her easychair
now please sit down and talk a little said lucilla i am so proud of having you both together
there never has been anybody in the world that i have missed so much as youyou knew that when you went away but you didn't mind
mr ashburton is very nice but he is of no use to speak of in an evening said miss marjoribanks turning a reflective glance upon her own candidate with a certain sadness and then they both laughed as if it was a joke but it was no joke as one of them at least must have known
lucilla said mrs john with consternation i never heard anybody talk as you do i am sure mr ashburton is the very best of society and as for mr cavendish  dear aunt jemima said lucilla would you mind ringing the bell
i have been sitting to maria brown and i am almost fainting
i wish you gentlemen would sit to her it would please her and it would not do you much harm and then for your constituents you know  i hope you don't wish me to look like one of maria brown's photographs to my constituents said mr cavendish but then i am happy to say they all know me pretty well
this was said with a slight touch of gentlemanly spite if there is such a thing for after all he was an old power in carlingford though he had been so long away
yes said lucilla reflectively but you are a little changed since then a little perhapsjust a littlestouter and  gone off
said mr cavendish with a laugh but he felt horribly disconcerted all the same and savage with miss marjoribanks and could not think why that fellow did not go away
what had he to do in lucilla's drawingroom
what did he mean by sitting down again and talking in that measured way to the old lady as if all the ordinary rules of good breeding did not point out to him that he should have gone away and left the field clear
oh you know it does not matter for a gentleman said lucilla and then she turned to mr ashburtoni am sure the major wants to see you and he thinks that it was he who put it into your head to stand
he was here that day at lunch you know and it was something he said  quite true said mr ashburton in his business way
i shall go to see him at once
thank you for telling me of it miss marjoribanks i shall go as soon as i leave here
and then mr cavendish laughed
this is what i call interesting he said
i hope mr ashburton sees the fun but it is trying to an old friend to hear of that day at lunch you know
i remember when these sort of allusions used to be pleasant enough but when one has been banished for a thousand years  yes said lucilla one leaves all that behind you knowone leaves ever so many things behind
i wish we could always be twenty for my part
i always said you know that i should be gone off in ten years
was it the only fib you ever told that you repeat it so
said mr cavendish and it was with this pretty speech that he took her downstairs to the wellremembered luncheon
but you have gone off in some things when you have to do with a prig like that he said in her ear as they went down together and cast off old friends
it was a thing a fellow did not expect of you
i never cast off old friends said miss marjoribanks
we shall look for you on thursday you know all the same
must you go mr ashburton when lunch is on the table
but then to be sure you will be in time at the browns' said lucilla sweetly and she gave the one rival her hand while she held the arm of the other at the door of the diningroom in which mr ashburton had gallantly deposited aunt jemima before saying goodbye
they were both looking a little black though the gloom was moderate in mr ashburton's case but as for lucilla she stood between them a picture of angelic sweetness and goodness giving a certain measure of her sympathy to bothwoman the reconciler by the side of those other characters of inspirer and consoler of which the world has heard
the two inferior creatures scowled with politeness at each other but miss marjoribanks smiled upon them both
such was the way in which she overcame the difficulties of the meeting
mr ashburton went away a little annoyed but still understanding his instructions and ready to act upon them in that businesslike way he had and mr cavendish remained faintly reassured in the midst of his soreness and mortification by at least having the field to himself and seeing the last for the present of his antagonistwhich was a kind of victory in its way
i thought i knew you better than to think you ever would have anything to do with that sort of thing said mr cavendish
there are people you know whom i could have imaginedbut a prig like that
he became indeed quite violent as aunt jemima said afterwards and met with that lady's decided disapproval as may be supposed
mr ashburton is very wellbred and agreeable mrs john said with emphasis
i wish all the young men i see nowadays were as nice
young men
said mr cavendish
is that what people call young nowadays
and he must be insane you know or he would never dream of representing a town without saying a single word about his principles
i dare say he thinks it is original said the unhappy man
he thought he was pointing out his rival's weakness to lucilla and he went on with energyi know you better than to think you can like that milkandwater sort of thing
oh i don't pretend to know anything about politics said lucilla
i hear you gentlemen talk but i never pretend to understand
if we were not to leave you that all to yourselves i don't know what you could find to do miss marjoribanks added compassionately and as she spoke she looked so like the lucilla of old who had schemed and plotted for mr cavendish that he could not believe in her desertion in his heart
that is a delusion like the going off he said
i can't believe you have gone over to the enemy
when i remember how i have been roving about all those ten years and how different it might have been and whose fault it all was  this mr cavendish said in a low voice but it did not the less horrify aunt jemima who felt prepared for any atrocity after it
she would have withdrawn in justice to her own sense of propriety but then she thought it was not impossible that he might propose to lucilla on the spot or take her hand or something and for propriety's sake she stayed
yes said lucillaand her heart did for one little moment give a faint thump against her breast
she could not help thinking what a difference it might have made to him poor fellow had he been under her lawful and righteous sway these ten years
but as she looked at him it became more and more apparent to miss marjoribanks that mr cavendish had gone off whatever she herself might have done
the outlines of his fine figure had changed considerably and his face was a little red and he had the look of a man whose circumstances spiritual and temporal would not quite bear a rigid examination
as she looked at him her pity became tinged by a certain shade of resentment to think that after all it was his own fault
she could not notwithstanding her natural frankness of expression say to him you foolish soul why didn't you marry me somehow and make a man of yourself
lucilla carried honesty very far but she could not go as far as that
yes she said turning her eyes upon him with a sort of abstract sympathy and then she added softly have you ever seen her again
with a lowering of her voice
this interesting question which utterly bewildered aunt jemima drove mr cavendish wild with rage
mrs john said afterwards that she felt a shiver go through her as he took up the carvingknife though it was only to cut some cold beef
he grew white all at once and pressed his lips tightly together and fixed his eyes on the wall straight before him
i did not think after what i once said to you miss marjoribanks that you would continue to insult my judgment in that way he said with a chill which fell upon the whole table and took the life out of everything and dimmed the very fire in the chimney
and after that the conversation was of a sufficiently ordinary description until they went back again into the drawingroom by which time mr cavendish seemed to have concluded that it was best to pocket the affront
i am going to begin my canvass tomorrow he said
i have not seen anybody yet
i have nobody but my sister to take me in hand you know
there was once a time when it might have been differentand he gave lucilla a look which she thought on the whole it was best to meet
yes said miss marjoribanks with cruel distinctness there was a time when you were the most popular man in grange laneeverybody was fond of you
i remember it as if it had been yesterday said lucilla with a sigh
you don't give a man much encouragement by jove
said the unlucky candidate
you remember it like yesterday
it may be vanity but i flatter myself i shall still be found the most popular man in grange lane
miss marjoribanks sighed again but she did not say anything
on the contrary she turned to aunt jemima who kept in the background an alarmed and alert spectator to consult her about a shade of wool and just then mr cavendish looking out of the window saw major brown conducting his rival through his garden and shaking hands with him cordially at the door
this was more than the patience of the other candidate could bear
a sudden resolution hot and angry as are the resolutions of men who feel themselves to have a failing cause came into his mind
he had been badgered and baited to such an extent as he thought that he had not time to consider if it was wise or not
he too had sat to maria brown and commanded once the warmest admiration of the household
he thought he would put it to the test and see if after all his popularity was only a thing to be remembered like yesterdayand it was with this intention that he bade a hurried goodbye to lucilla and rushing out threw himself at once upon the troubled waves of society which had once been as smooth as glass to the most popular man in grange lane
chapter xli   mr cavendish thought he had been an object of admiration to maria brown as we have said
he thought of it with a little middleaged complacency and a confidence that this vague sentiment would stand the test he was about to apply to it which did honour to the freshness of his heart
with this idea it was miss brown he asked for as he knocked at the major's door and he found them both in the drawingroom maria with gloves on to hide the honourable stains of her photography which made her comparatively useless when she was out of her studioand her father walking about in a state of excitement which was indeed what mr cavendish expected
the two exchanged a guilty look when they saw who their visitor was
they looked as people might well look who had been caught in the fact and did not know how to get over it
they came forward both of them with a cowardly cordiality and eagerness to welcome himhow very good of you to come to see us so soon
miss brown said and fluttered and looked at her father and could not tell what more to say
and then a dead pause fell upon themsuch a pause as not unfrequently falls upon people who have got through their mutual greetings almost with an excess of cordiality
they stopped short all at once and looked at each other and smiled and made a fatal conscious effort to talk of something
it is so good of you to come so soon miss brown repeated perhaps you have been to see lucilla and then she stopped again slightly tremulous and turned an appealing gaze to her papa
i have come to see you said mr cavendish plucking up all his courage
i have been a long time gone you know but i have not forgotten carlingford and you must forgive me for saying that i was very glad to hear i might still come to seemiss brown
as for lydia
said the candidate looking about him with a smile
ah lydia said her sister with a sighher eldest is eight mr cavendish
we don't see her as often as we should likemarriage makes such a difference
of course it is quite natural she should be all for her own family now
quite natural said mr cavendish and then he turned to the major
i don't think there are quite so many public changes as i expected to see
the old rector always holds out and the old colonel and you have not done much that i can see about the new paving
you know what i have come home about major and i am sure i can count upon you to support me the candidate said with a great deal more confidence than he felt in his voice
major brown cleared his throat his heart was moved by the familiar voice and he could not conceal his embarrassment
i hope nothing will ever occur he said to make any difference in the friendly feelingsi am sure i shall be very glad to welcome you back permanently to carlingford
you may always rest assured of that and he held out his hand
but he grew red as he thought of his treachery and maria who was quaking over it did not even try to say a word to help himand as for mr cavendish he took up his position on the arm of the sofa as he used to do
but he had a slim youthful figure when he used to do it and now the attitude was one which revealed a certain dawning rotundity very different as maria afterwards said from one's idea of mr cavendish
he was not aware of it himself but as these two people looked their simultaneous thought was how much he had changed
thank you you are very kind said mr cavendish
i have been a little lazy i am afraid since i came here but i expect my agent down tonight and then i hope you'll come over to my place and have a talk with woodburn and centum and the rest about it
i am a poor tactician for my part
you shall contrive what is best to be done and i'll carry it out
i suppose i may expect almost to walk over he said
it was the confidence of despair that moved him
the more he saw that his cause was lost the more he would make it out that he was sure to winwhich is not an unusual state of mind
ii don't know i am sure said poor major brown
to tell the truth ithough i can safely say my sympathies are always with you cavendishihave been so unfortunate as to commit myself you know
it was quite involuntary i am sure for i never thought my casual expression of opinion likely to have any weight  papa never will perceive the weight that is attached to his opinion said miss brown
i was not thinking of it in the least maria said the modest major but the fact is it seems to have been that that decided ashburton to stand and after drawing a man in to such a thing the least one can do is to back him out in it
nobody had an idea then you know that you were coming back my dear fellow
i assure you if i had known  but even if you had known you know you never meant it papa said maria
and mr cavendish sat on the arm of the sofa and put his hands deep into his pockets and dropped his upper lip and knit his eyebrows a little and listened to the anxious people excusing themselves
he did not make any answer one way or another
he was terribly mortified and disappointed and it went against his pride to make further remonstrances
when they had done he got down off his seat and took his right hand out of his pocket and offered it to miss brown who putting her own into it poor soul
with the remembrance of her ancient allegiance was like to cry
well he said if that is the case i suppose i need not bother you any longer
you'll give me your good wishes all the same
i used to hear of ashburton sometimes but i never had the least idea he was so popular
and to tell the truth i don't think he's any great things to brag ofthough i suppose it's not to be expected i should appreciate his qualities mr cavendish added with a laugh
as for miss brown it was all she could do to keep from crying as he went away
she said she could see by the way he left the drawingroom that he was a stricken deer and yet notwithstanding this sympathetic feeling she could not but acknowledge when miss marjoribanks mentioned it that to have been such a handsome man he was inconceivably gone off
mr cavendish went up grange lane with his hands in his pockets and tried to think that he did not care but he did care all the same and was very bitter in his mind over the failure of friends and the vanity of expectations
the last time he had walked past those garden walls he had thought himself sure of the support of carlingford and the personal esteem of all the people in all the houses he was passing
it was after the archdeacon had broken down in his case against the man whom he called an adventurer and when mr cavendish felt all the sweetness of being a member of an oligarchy and entitled to the sympathy and support of his order
now he went along the same path with his hat over his ears and his hands in his pockets and rage and pain in his heart
whose fault was it that his friends had deserted him and carlingford knew him no more
he might as well have asked whose fault it was that he was getting stout and red in the face and had not the same grace of figure nor ease of mind as he used to have
he had come very near to settling down and becoming a man of domestic respectability in this quiet place and he had just escaped in time and had laughed over it since and imagined himself with much glee an old fogy looking after a lot of children
but the fact is that men do become old fogies even when they have no children to look after and lose their figure and their elasticity just as soon and perhaps a little sooner in the midst of what is called life than in any milder scene of enjoyment
and it would have been very handy just now to have been sure of his election without paying much for it
he had been living fast and spending a great deal of money and this after all was the only real ambition he had ever had and he had thought within himself that if he won he would change his mode of life and turn over a new leaf and become all at once a different man
when a man has made such a resolution and feels not only that a mere success but a moral reformation depends upon his victory he may be permitted to consider that he has a right to win and it may be divined what his state of mind was when he had made the discovery that even his old friends did not see his election to be of any such importance as he did and could think of a miserable little bit of selfimportance or gratified vanity more than of his interestseven the women who had once been so kind to him
he had just got so far in his thoughts when he met mr centum who stared for a moment and then burst into one of his great laughs as he greeted him
good lord
cavendish is this you
i never expected to see you like that
the banker said in his coarse way
you're stouter than i am old fellow and such an adonis as you used to be
mr cavendish had to bear all this without giving way to his feelings or even showing them any more than he could help it
nobody would spare him that imbecile suggestion as to how things used to be
to be growing stouter than centum without centum's excuse of being a welltodo householder and father of a family and respectable man from whom stoutness was expected was very bitter to him but he had to gulp it down and recollect that centum was as yet the only influential supporter except his brotherinlaw whom he had in carlingford
what have you been doing with yourself since you came that nobody has seen you
said mr centum
if you are to do any good here you know we shall have to look alive
i have been ill said the unfortunate candidate with a little natural loss of temper
you would not have a man to trudge about at this time of year in all weathers when he is ill  i would not be ill again if i were you till it's all over said mr centum
we shall have to fight every inch of our ground and i tell you that fellow ashburton knows what he's abouthe goes at everything in a steady sort of way
he's not brilliant you know but he's sure  brilliant
said mr cavendish i should think not
it is lucilla marjoribanks who is putting him up to it
you know she had an old grudge at me
oh nonsense about lucilla said mr centum
i can tell you ashburton is not at all a contemptible adversary
he is going to work in the cunningest waynot a woman's sort of thing and he's not a ladies' man like you the banker added with a laugh
but i am afraid you can't go in for that sort of thing as you used to do cavendish
you should marry and settle and become a steady member of society now you've grown so stout
this was the kind of way in which he was addressed even by his own supporter who uttered another great laugh as he went off upon his busy way
it was a sort of thing mr cavendish was not used to and he felt it accordingly
to be sure he knew that he was ten years older and that there were several things which he could not do with the same facility as in his youth
but he had saved up carlingford in his imagination as a spot in which he would always be young and where nobody should find out the difference and instead of that it was precisely in carlingford that he was fated to hear how changed he was with a frankness which only old friends would have been justified in using
as for lucilla marjoribanks she was rather better looking than otherwise and absolutely had not gone off
it did not occur to mr cavendish that this might be because lucilla at present was not still so old as he had been ten years ago in the period which he now considered his youth
he was rather disposed on the contrary to take a moral view and to consider that it was her feminine incapacity for going too far which had kept years and amusements from having their due effect upon miss marjoribanks
and poor fellow he had gone too far
he had not been as careful in his life as he might have been had he stayed at carlingford and now he was paying the penalty
such was the edifying state of mind which he had come to when he reached the top of grove street
and there a waft of soft recollections came across his mind
in the absence of all sympathy he could not help turning back to the thought of the enchantress of old who used to sing to him and listen to him and storm at him
probably he would have ended by strolling along the familiar street and canvassing for mr lake's vote which would have done him no good in carlingford but just then dr marjoribanks stopped in his brougham
the doctor was looking very strange that morning though nobody had particularly remarked itperhaps because he smoothed his countenance when he was out of the brougham which was his refuge when he had anything to think about
but he stopped suddenly to speak to mr cavendish and perhaps he had not time to perform that ceremony
he looked dark and cloudy and constrained and as if he forced himself to speak which to be sure under the circumstances was not so very strange
i am very glad to see you the doctor said though you were a day too late you know
why didn't you give us warning before we all went and committed ourselves
if we had known that you were coming  ah that's what old brown said said mr cavendish with a slight shrug of his shoulders which was imprudent for the major was not so old as the doctor and besides was a much less important man in grange lane
so you have been to see old brown said dr marjoribanks in his dry way
he always was a great admirer of yours
i can't wish you luck you know for if you win we lose  oh i don't want you to wish me luck
i don't suppose there can be much comparison between my chance and that of a new man whom nobody ever heard of in my time said the candidate for carlingford
i thought you scotchmen doctor always liked to be on the winning side
we've a way of making our side the winning side said dr marjoribanks grimly for he was touchy where his nationality was concerned
health all right i hope
he added looking at mr cavendish with that critical medical glance which shows that a verbal response is quite unnecessary
this time there was in the look a certain insinuation of doubt on the subject which was not pleasant
you are getting stout i see dr marjoribanks addednot laughing but as if that too was poor mr cavendish's fault
yes i'm very well he answered curtly but the truth was that he did not feel sure that he was quite well after he had seen the critical look in dr marjoribanks's eye
you young men always go too fast said the doctor with a strange little smile but the term at least was consolatory and after that doctor marjoribanks quite changed his tone
have you heard woodburn talking of that great crash in town
he saidthat india house you knowi suppose it's quite true
quite true said mr cavendish promptly and somehow he felt a pleasure in saying it
i got all the particulars today in one of my lettersand lots of private people involved which is always the way with these old houses he added with a mixture of curiosity and malicewidows and all sorts of superannuated folks
it's a great pity said the doctor i knew old lichfield once the chief partneri am very sorry to hear it's true and then the two shook hands and the brougham drove on
as for mr cavendish he made up his mind at once that the doctor was involved and was not sorry and felt that it was a sort of judicial recompense for his desertion of his friends
and he went home to tell his sister of it who shared in his sentiments
and then it was not worth while going out any more that dayfor the electioneering agent who knew all about it was not coming till the last train
i suppose i shall have to work when he is here mr cavendish said
and in the meantime he threw himself into an easy chair
perhaps that was why he was getting so stout
and in the meantime the doctor went on visiting his patients
when he came back to his brougham between his visits and went bowling along in that comfortable way along the familiar roads there was a certain glumness upon his face
he was not a demonstrative man but when he was alone you could tell by certain lines about the wellworn cordage of his countenance whether all was right with the doctor and it was easy to see just at this moment that all was not right with him
but he did not say anything about it when he got home on the contrary he was just as usual and told his daughter all about his encounter with mr cavendish
a man at his time of life has no right to get fatit's a sort of thing i don't like to see
and he'll never be a ladies' man no more lucilla said the doctor with a gleam of humour in his eye
he is exactly like george the fourth papa said miss marjoribanks and the doctor laughed as he sat down to dinner
if he had anything on his mind he bore it like a hero and gave no sign but then as mrs john very truly remarked when a man does not disclose his annoyances they always tell more upon him in the end
chapter xlii   there were a great many reasons why this should be a critical period in miss marjoribanks's life
for one thing it was the limit she had always proposed to herself for her term of youngladyhood and naturally as she outgrew the age for them she felt disposed to put away childish things
to have the control of society in her hands was a great thing but still the mere means without any end was not worth lucilla's whileand her thursdays were almost a bore to her in her present stage of development
they occurred every week to be sure as usual but the machinery was all perfect and went on by itself and it was not in the nature of things that such a light adjunct of existence should satisfy lucilla as she opened out into the ripeness of her thirtieth year
it was this that made mr ashburton so interesting to her and his election a matter into which she entered so warmly for she had come to an age at which she might have gone into parliament herself had there been no disqualification of sex and when it was almost a necessity for her to make some use of her social influence
miss marjoribanks had her own ideas in respect to charity and never went upon ladies' committees nor took any further share than what was proper and necessary in parish work and when a woman has an active mind and still does not care for parish work it is a little hard for her to find a sphere
and lucilla though she said nothing about a sphere was still more or less in that condition of mind which has been so often and so fully described to the british publicwhen the ripe female intelligence not having the natural resource of a nursery and a husband to manage turns inwards and begins to make a protest against the existing order of society and to call the world to account for giving it no due occupationand to consume itself
she was not the woman to make protests nor claim for herself the doubtful honours of a false position but she felt all the same that at her age she had outlived the occupations that were sufficient for her youth
to be sure there were still the dinners to attend to a branch of human affairs worthy of the weightiest consideration and she had a house of her own as much as if she had been half a dozen times married but still there are instincts which go even beyond dinners and lucilla had become conscious that her capabilities were greater than her work
she was a power in carlingford and she knew it but still there is little good in the existence of a power unless it can be made use of for some worthy end
she was coming up grange lane rather late one evening pondering upon these thingsthinking within herself compassionately of poor mr cavendish a little in the same way as he had been thinking of her but from the opposite point of view
for lucilla could not but see the antithesis of their position and how he was the foolish apprentice who had chosen his own way and was coming to a bad end while she was the steady one about to ride by in her lord mayor's coach
and miss marjoribanks was thinking at the same time of the other candidate whose canvass was going on so successfully and that after the election and all the excitement was over she would feel a blankand lucilla did not see how the blank was to be filled up as she looked into the future for as has been said parish work was not much in her way and for a woman who feels that she is a power there are so few other outlets
she was a little disheartened as she thought it all over
gleams of possibility it is true crossed her mind such as that of marrying the member for carlingford for instance and thus beginning a new and more important career but she was too experienced a woman not to be aware by this time that possibilities which did not depend upon herself alone had better not be calculated upon
and there did occur to her among other things the idea of making a great experiment which could be carried out only by a woman of geniusof marrying a poor man and affording to carlingford and england an example which might influence unborn generations
such were the thoughts that were passing through her mind when to her great surprise she came up to her father walking up grange lane over the dirty remains of the snowfor there was a great deal of snow that year
it was so strange a sight to see dr marjoribanks walking that at the first glance lucilla was startled and thought something was the matter but of course it all arose from a perfectly natural and explainable cause
i have been down to see mrs chiley said the doctor she has her rheumatism very bad again and the horse has been so long out that i thought i would walk home
i think the old lady is a little upset about cavendish lucilla
he was always a pet of hers
dear mrs chiley
she is not very bad i hope
said miss marjoribanks
oh no she is not very bad said the doctor in a dreary tone
the poor old machine is just about breaking up that is all
we can cobble it this once but next time perhaps  don't talk in such a disheartening way papa said lucilla
i am sure she is not so very old
we're all pretty old for that matter said the doctor we can't run on for ever you know
if you had been a boy like that stupid fellow tom you might have carried on my practice lucillaand even extended it i shouldn't wonder dr marjoribanks added with a little grunt as who should say that is the way of the world
but i am not a boy said lucilla mildly and even if i had been you know i might have chosen another profession
tom never had any turn for medicine that i ever heard of  i hope you know pretty well about all the turns he ever had with that oldwoman said the doctor pulling himself up sharply always at your ear
i suppose she never talks of anything else
but i hope you have too much sense for that sort of thing lucilla
tom will never be anything but a poor man if he were to live a hundred years
perhaps not papa said lucilla with a little sigh
the doctor knew nothing about the great social experiment which it had entered into miss marjoribanks's mind to make for the regeneration of her contemporaries and the good of society or possibly he might not have distinguished tom by that particular title
was it he perhaps who was destined to be the hero of a domestic drama embodying the best principles of that moral philosophy which lucilla had studied with such success at mount pleasant
she did not ask herself the question for things had not as yet come to that point but it gleamed upon her mind as by a sidelight
i don't know how you would get on if you were poor said the doctor
i don't think that would suit you
you would make somebody a capital wife i can say that for you lucilla that had plenty of money and a liberal disposition like yourself
but poverty is another sort of thing i can tell you
luckily you're old enough to have got over all the loveinacottage ideasif you ever had them dr marjoribanks added
he was a worldly man himself and he thought his daughter a worldly woman and yet though he thoroughly approved of it he still despised lucilla a little for her prudence which is a paradoxical state of mind not very unusual in the world
i don't think i ever had them said lucilla not that kind of poverty
i know what a cottage means it means a wretched man always about the house with his feet in slippers you knowwhat poor dear mr cavendish would come to if he was poor  the doctor laughed though he had not seemed up to this moment much disposed for laughing
so that is all your opinion of cavendish he said and i don't think you are far wrong either and yet that was a young fellow that might have done better dr marjoribanks said reflectively perhaps not without a slight prick of conscience that he had forsaken an old friend
yes said lucilla with a certain solemnitybut you know papa if a man will not when he may and she sighed though the doctor who had not been thinking of mr cavendish's prospects in that light laughed once more but it was a sharp sort of sudden laugh without much heart in it
he had most likely other things of more importance in his mind
well there have been a great many off and on since that time he said smiling rather grimly
it is time you were thinking about it seriously lucilla
i am not so sure about some things as i once was and i'd rather like to see you well settled beforeit's a kind of prejudice a man has the doctor said abruptly which whatever he might mean by it was a dismal sort of speech to make
before what papa
asked lucilla with a little alarm
tutbefore long to be sure he said impatiently
ashburton would not be at all amiss if he liked it and you liked it but it's no use making any suggestions about those things
so long as you don't marry a fool dr marjoribanks said with energy
i knowthat is of course i've seen what that is you can't expect to get perfection as you might have looked for perhaps at twenty but i advise you to marry lucilla
i don't think you are cut out for a single woman for my part
i don't see the good of single women said lucilla unless they are awfully rich and i don't suppose i shall ever be awfully rich
but papa so long as i can be a comfort to you  yes said the doctor with that tone which lucilla could remember fifteen years ago when she made the same magnanimous suggestion but i can't live for ever you know
it would be a pity to sacrifice yourself to me and then perhaps next morning find that it was a useless sacrifice
it very often happens like that when selfdevotion is carried too far
you've behaved very well and shown a great deal of good sense lucillamore than i gave you credit for when you commencedi may say that and if there was to be any change for instance  what change
said lucilla not without some anxiety for it was an odd way of talking to say the least of it but the doctor had come to a pause and did not seem disposed to resume
it is not so pleasant as i thought walking over this snow he said i can't give that up that i can see
and there's more snow in the air if i'm any judge of the weather
therego ingo in don't wait for mebut mind you make haste and dress for i want my dinner
i may have to go down to mrs chiley again tonight
it was an odd way of talking and it was odd to break off like this but then to be sure there was no occasion for any more conversation since they had just arrived at their own door
it made lucilla uneasy for the moment but while she was dressing she managed to explain it to herself and to think after all it was only natural that her papa should have seen a little into the movement and commotion of her thoughts and then poor dear old mrs chiley being so ill who was one of his own set so to speak
he was quite cheerful later in the evening and enjoyed his dinner and was even more civil than usual to mrs john
and though he did not come up to tea he made his appearance afterwards with a flake of newfallen snow still upon his rusty gray whiskers
he had gone to see his patient again notwithstanding the silent storm outside
and his countenance was a little overcast this time no doubt by the late walk and the serious state mrs chiley was in and his encounter with the snow
oh yes she is better he said
i knew she would do this time
people at our time of life don't go off in that accidental kind of way
when a woman has been so long used to living it takes her a time to get into the way of dying
she might be a long time thinking about it yet if all goes well  papa don't speak like that
said lucilla
dying
i can't bear to think of such a thing
she is not so very old
such things will happen whether you can bear to think of them or not said the doctor
i said you would go down and see her tomorrow
we've all held out a long timethe lot of us
i don't like to think of the first gap myself but somebody must make a beginning you know
the chileys were always older than you said mrs john
i remember in poor mrs marjoribanks's timethey were quite elderly then and you were just beginning
when my tom was a baby  we were always of the same set said the doctor interrupting her without hesitation
lucilla they say cavendish has got hold of the rector
he has made believe to be penitent you know
that is cleverer than anything you could have done
and if he can't be won back again it will be serious the colonel says
you are to try if you can suggest anything
it seems said the doctor with mingled amusement and satire and a kind of gratification that ashburton has great confidence in you
it must have been the agent said lucilla
i don't think any of the rest of them are equal to that
i don't see if that is the case how we are to win him back
if mr ashburton had ever done anything very wicked perhaps  you are safe to say he is not penitent anyhow said dr marjoribanks and he took his candle and went away with a smile
but either mr ashburton's good opinion of lucilla or some other notion had touched the doctor
he was not a man who said much at any time but when he bade her goodnight his hand drooped upon lucilla's shoulder and he patted it softly as he might have patted the head of a child
it was not much but still it was a good deal from him
to feel the lingering touch of her father's hand caressing her even in so mild a way was something quite surprising and strange to miss marjoribanks
she looked up at him almost with alarm but he was just then turning away with his candle in his hand
and he seemed to have laid aside his gloom and even smiled to himself as he went upstairs
if she had been the boy instead of that young ass he said to himself
he could not have explained why he was more than ordinarily hard just then upon the innocent fardistant tom who was unlucky it is true but not exactly an ass after all
but somehow it struck the doctor more than ever how great a loss it was to society and to herself that lucilla was not the boy
she could have continued and perhaps extended the practice whereas just now it was quite possible that she might drop down into worstedwork and teaparties like any other single womanwhile tom who had carried off the family honours and was the boy in this limited and unfruitful generation was never likely to do anything to speak of and would be a poor man if he were to live for a hundred years
perhaps there was something else behind that made the doctor's brow contract a little as he crossed the threshold of his chamber into which no more than into the recesses of his heart no one ever penetrated but it was the lighter idea of that comparison which had no actual pain in it but only a kind of humorous discontent which was the last articulate thought in his mind as he went to his room and closed his door with a little sharpness as he always did upon the outside world
aunt jemima for her part lingered a little with lucilla downstairs
my dear i don't think my brotherinlaw looks well tonight
i don't think carlingford is so healthy as it is said to be
if i were you lucilla i would try and get your papa to take something said mrs john with anxiety before he goes to bed
dear aunt jemima he never takes anything
you forget he is a doctor said miss marjoribanks
it always puts him out when he has to go out in the evening and he is sad about mrs chiley though he would not say so
but nevertheless lucilla knocked at his door when she went upstairs
and the doctor though he did not open growled within with a voice which reassured his dutiful daughter
what should i want do you think but to be left quiet
the doctor said
and even mrs john who had waited at his door with her candle in her hand to hear the result shrank within at the sound and was seen no more
and miss marjoribanks too went to her rest with more than one subject of thought which kept her awake
in the first place the rector was popular in his way and if he chose to call all his forces to rally round a penitent there was no saying what might come of it and then lucilla could not help going back in the most illogical manner to her father's caress and wondering what was the meaning of it
meantime the snow fell heavily outside and wrapped everything in a soft and secret whiteness
and amid the whiteness and darkness the lamp burned steadily outside at the gardengate which pointed out the doctor's door amid all the closed houses and dark gardenwalls in grange lanea kind of visible succour and help always at hand for those who were suffering
and though dr marjoribanks was not like a young man making a practice but had perfect command of carlingford and was one of the richest men in it it was well known in the town that the very poorest if in extremity in the depths of the wildest night that ever blew would not seek help there in vain
the bell that had roused him when he was young still hung near him in the silence of his closedup house when he was old and still could make him spring up all selfpossessed and ready when the enemy death had to be fought with
but that night the snow cushioned the wire outside and even made white cornices and columns about the steady lamp and the doctor slept within and no one disturbed him for except mrs chiley and a few chronic patients there was nothing particularly amiss in carlingford and then it was dr rider whom all the new people went to the people who lived in the innumerable new houses at the other end of carlingford and had no hallowing tradition of the superior authority of grange lane
chapter xliii   the talk of this evening might not have been considered of any importance to speak of but for the extraordinary and most unlookedfor event which startled all carlingford next morning
nobody could believe that it was true
dr marjoribanks's patients waited for him and declared to their nurses that it was all a madeup story and that he would come and prove that he was not dead
how could he be dead
he had been as well as he ever was that last evening
he had gone down grange lane in the snow to see the poor old lady who was now sobbing in her bed and saying it was all a mistake and that it was she who ought to have died
but all those protestations were of no avail against the cold and stony fact which had frightened thomas out of his senses when he went to call the doctor
he had died in the night without calling or disturbing anybody
he must have felt faint it seemed for he had got up and taken a little brandy the remains of which still stood on the table by his bedside but that was all that anybody could tell about it
they brought dr rider of course but all that he could do was to examine the strong still frameold and yet not old enough to be weakly or to explain such sudden extinctionwhich had ceased its human functions
and then the news swept over carlingford like a breath of wind though there was no wind even on that silent snowy day to carry the matter
dr marjoribanks was dead
it put the election out of people's heads and even their own affairs for the time being for had he not known all about the greater part of themseen them come into the world and kept them in itand put himself always in the breach when the pale death approached that way
he had never made very much boast of his friendliness or been large in sympathetic expressions but yet he had never flinched at any time or deserted his patients for any consideration
carlingford was sorry profoundly sorry with that true sorrow which is not so much for the person mourned as for the mourner's self who feels a sense of something lost
the people said to themselves whom could they ever find who would know their constitutions so well and who was to take care of soandso if he had another attack
to be sure dr rider was at hand who felt a little agitated about it and was conscious of the wonderful opening and was very ready to answer i am here but a young doctor is different from an old one and a living man all in commonplace health and comfort is not to be compared with a dead one on the morning at least of his sudden ending
thank heaven when a life is ended there is always that hour or two remaining to set straight the defective balances and do a hasty late justice to the dead before the wave sweeps on over him and washes out the traces of his steps and lets in the common crowd to make their thoroughfare over the grave
it cannot be the doctor mrs chiley said sobbing in her bed or else it has been in mistake for me
he was always a healthy man and never had anything the matter with himand a great deal younger than we are you know
if anything has happened to him it must have been in mistake for me said the poor old lady and she was so hysterical that they had to send for dr rider and she was thus the first to begin to build the new world on the foundations of the old little as she meant it
but for the moment everything was paralysed in grange lane and canvassing came to a standstill and nothing was discussed but dr marjoribankshow he was dead though nobody could or would believe it and how lucilla would be left and who her trustees were and how the place could ever get used to the want of him or would ever look like itself again without his familiar presence
it was by way of relieving their minds from the horror of the idea that the good people rushed into consultations what lucilla would do
it took their minds a little off the ghastly imagination of that dark room with the snow on the window and the late moonlight trying to get into the darkness and the white rigid face inside as he was said to have been found
it could not but make a terrible change to herindeed through her it could not but make a great change to everybody
the doctor's house would of course be shut up which had been the most hospitable house in carlingford and things would drop into the unsatisfactory state they used to be in before miss marjoribanks's time and there would no longer be anybody to organise society
such were the ideas the ladies of grange lane relapsed into by way of delivering themselves from the pain of their first realisation of what had happened
it would make a great change
even the election and its anticipated joys could not but change character in some respects at least and there would be nobody to make the best of them and then the question was what would lucilla do
would she have strength to make an effort as some people suggested or would she feel not only her grief but her downfall and that she was now only a single woman and sink into a private life as some others were inclined to believe
inside the house naturally the state of affairs was sad enough
lucilla notwithstanding the many other things she had had to occupy her mind was fond of her father and the shock overwhelmed her for the moment
though she was not the kind of woman to torture herself with thinking of things that she might have done still at the first moment the idea that she ought not to have left him alonethat she should have sat up and watched or taken some extraordinary unusual precautionwas not to be driven away from her mind
the reign of reason was eclipsed in her as it often is in such an emergency
she said it was her fault in the first horror
when i saw how he was looking and how he was talking i should never have left him said lucilla which indeed was a very natural thing to say but would have been an utterly impossible one to carry out as she saw when she came to think of it
but she could not think of it just then
she did not think at all that first long snowy troubled day but went about the house on the bedroom floor wringing her hands like a creature distracted
if i had only sat up she said and then she would recall the touch of his hand on her shoulder which she seemed still to be feeling and cry out like all the rest of the world that it could not be true
but to be sure that was a state of feeling that could not last long
there are events for which something higher than accident must be held accountable were one ever so ready to take the burden of affairs on one's own shoulders and lucilla knew when she came to herself that if she had watched ever so long or so closely that could have had no effect upon the matter
after a while the bewildering sense of her own changed position began to come upon her and roused her up into that feverish and unnatural activity of thought which in some minds is the inevitable reaction after the unaccustomed curb and shock of grief
when she had got used to that dreadful certainty about her father and had suddenly come with a leap to the knowledge that she was not to blame and could not help it and that though he was gone she remained it is no censure upon lucilla to say that her head became immediately full of a horror and confusion of thoughts an involuntary stir and bustle of plans and projects which she did all she could to put down but which would return and overwhelm her whether she chose it or not
she could not help asking herself what her new position was thinking it over so strangely free and new and unlimited as it seemed
and it must be recollected that miss marjoribanks was a woman of very active mind and great energies too old to take up a girl's fancy that all was over because she had encountered a natural grief on her passage and too young not to see a long future still before her
she kept her room as was to be expected and saw nobody and only moved the household and superintended the arrangements in a muffled way through thomas who was an old servant and knew the ways of the house but notwithstanding her seclusion and her honest sorrow and her perfect observance of all the ordinary restraints of the moment it would be wrong to omit all mention of this feverish bustle of thinking which came into lucilla's mind in her solitude
of all that she had to bear it was the thing that vexed and irritated and distressed her the mostas if she said to herself indignantly she ought to have been able to think of anything
and the chances are that lucilla for sheer duty's sake would have said if anybody had asked that of course she had not thought of anything as yet without being aware that the mere shock and horror and profound commotion had a great deal more to do than anything else in producing that fluttering crowd of busy vexatious speculations which had come without any will of hers into her heart
it looked a dreadful change in one way as she looked at it without wishing to look at it in the solitude of her own room where the blinds were all down and the snow sometimes came with a little thump against the window and where it was so dark that it was a comfort when night came and the lamp could be lighted
so far as carlingford was concerned it would be almost as bad for miss marjoribanks as if she were her father's widow instead of his daughter
to keep up a position of social importance in a single woman's house unless as she had herself lightly said so short a time since she were awfully rich would be next to impossible
all that gave importance to the centre of societythe hospitable table the open househad come to an end with the doctor
things could no more be as they had once been in that respect at least
she might stay in the house and keep up to the furthest extent possible to her its old traditions but even to the utmost limit to which lucilla could think it right to go it could never be the same
this consciousness kept gleaming upon her as she sat in the dull daylight behind the closed blinds with articles of mourning piled about everywhere and the gray dimness getting into her very eyes and her mind distressed by the consciousness that she ought to have been unable to think and the sadness of the prospect altogether was enough to stir up a reaction in spite of herself in miss marjoribanks's mind
and on the other side she would no doubt be very well off and could go wherever she liked and had no limit except what was right and proper and becoming to what she might please to do
she might go abroad if she liked which perhaps is the first idea of the modern english mind when anything happens to it and settle wherever she pleased and arrange her mode of existence as seemed good in her own eyes
she would be an heiress in a moderate way and aunt jemima was by this time absolutely at her disposal and could be taken anywhere and at lucilla's age it was quite impossible to predict what might not happen to a woman in such a position
when these fairer possibilities gleamed into lucilla's mind it would be difficult to describe the anger and selfdisgust with which she reproached herselffor perhaps it was the first time that she had consciously failed in maintaining a state of mind becoming the occasion and though nobody but herself knew of it the pain of the accusation was acute and bitter
but how could miss marjoribanks help itthe mind travels so much quicker than anything else and goes so far and makes its expeditions in such subtle stealthy ways
she might begin by thinking of her dear papa and yet before she could dry her eyes might be off in the midst of one of these bewildering speculations
for everything was certain now so far as he was concerned and everything was so uncertain and full of such unknown issues for herself
thus the dark days before the funeral passed byand everybody was very kind
dr marjoribanks was one of the props of the place and all carlingford bestirred itself to do him the final honours and all her friends conspired how to save lucilla from all possible trouble and help her over the trial and to see how much he was respected was the greatest of all possible comforts to her as she said
thus it was that among the changes that everybody looked for there occurred all at once this change which was entirely unexpected and put everything else out of mind for the moment
for to tell the truth dr marjoribanks was one of the men who according to external appearance need never have died
there was nothing about him that wanted to be set right no sort of loss or failure or misunderstanding so far as anybody could see
an existence in which he could have his friends to dinner every week and a good house and good wine and a very good table and nothing particular to put him out of his way seemed in fact the very ideal of the best life for the doctor
there was nothing in him that seemed to demand anything better and it was confusing to try to follow him into that which no doubt must be in all its fundamentals a very different kind of world
he was a just man and a good man in his way and had been kind to many people in his lifetimebut still he did not seem to have that need of another rectifying completer existence which most men have
there seemed no reason why he should diea man who was so well contented with this lower region in which many of us fare badly and where so few of us are contented
this was a fact which exercised a very confusing influence even when they themselves were not aware of it on many people's minds
it was hard to think of him under any other circumstances or identify him with angels and spiritswhich feeling on the whole made the regret for him a more poignant sort of regret
and they buried him with the greatest signs of respect
people from twenty miles off sent their carriages and all the george street people shut their shops and there was very little business done all day
mr cavendish and mr ashburton walked side by side at the funeral which was an affecting sight to see and if anything more could have been done to show their respect which was not done the corporation of carlingford would have been sorry for it
and the snow still lay deep in all the corners though it had been trampled down all about the doctor's house where the lamp was not lighted now of nights for what was the use of lighting the lamp which was a kind of lighthouse in its way and meant to point out succour and safety for the neighbours when the physician himself was lying beyond all hope of succour or aid
and all the grange lane people retired in a sympathetic awestricken way and decided or at least the ladies did to see lucilla next day if she was able to see them and to find out whether she was going to make an effort or what she meant to do
and mrs chiley was so much better that she was able to be up a little in the evening though she scarcely could forgive herself and still could not help thinking that it was she who had really been sent for and that the doctor had been taken in mistake
and as for lucilla she sat in her room and cried and thought of her father's hand upon her shoulderthat last unusual caress which was more touching to think of than a world of words
he had been fond of her and proud of her and at the last moment he had showed it
and by times she seemed to feel again that lingering touch and cried as if her heart would break and yet for all that she could not keep her thoughts steady nor prevent them from wandering to all kinds of profane outofdoor matters and to considerations of the future and estimates of her own position
it wounded her sadly to feel herself in such an inappropriate state of mind but she could not help it and then the want of natural light and air oppressed her sorely and she longed for the evening which felt a little more natural and thought that at last she might have a long talk with aunt jemima who was a kind of refuge in her present loneliness and gave her a means of escape at the same time from all this bustle and commotion of unbecoming thoughts
this was enough surely for any one to have to encounter at one time but that very night another rumour began to murmur through carlingforda rumour more bewildering more incredible still than that of the doctor's death which the town had been obliged to confirm and acknowledge and put its seal to
when the thing was first mentioned everybody who could find it in their heart to laugh laughed loud in the face of the first narrator with mingled scepticism and indignation
they asked him what he meant by it and ridiculed and scoffed at him to his face
lucilla will be the richest woman in grange lane people said everybody in carlingford knows that
but after this statement had been made the town began to listen
it was obliged to listen for other witnesses came in to confirm the story
it never might have been found out while the doctor lived for he had a great practice and made a great deal of money but now that he was dead nothing could be hid
he was dead and he had made an elaborate will which was all as just and righteous as a will could be but after the will was read it was found out that everything named in it had disappeared like a bubble
instead of being the richest dr marjoribanks was one of the poorest men in carlingford when he shut his door behind him on that snowy night
it was a revelation which took the town perfectly by storm and startled everybody out of their senses
lucilla's plans which she thought so wicked went out all of a sudden in a certain dull amaze and dismay to which no words could give any expression
such was the second inconceivable reverse of fortune which happened to miss marjoribanks more unexpected more incomprehensible still than the other in the very midst of her most important activities and hopes
chapter xliv   when the first whisper of the way in which she wasas people sayleft reached lucilla her first feeling was incredulity
it was conveyed to her by aunt jemima who came to her in her room after the funeral with a face blanched with dismay
miss marjoribanks took it for grief and though she did not look for so much feeling from mrs john was pleased and comforted that her aunt should really lament her poor papa
it was a compliment which in the softened and sorrowful state of lucilla's mind went to her heart
aunt jemima came up and kissed her in a hasty excited way which showed genuine and spontaneous emotion and was not like the solemn pomp with which sympathising friends generally embrace a mourner and then she made lucilla sit down by the fire and held her hands
my poor child said aunt jemimamy poor dear sacrificed child
you know lucilla how fond i am of you and you can always come to me  thank you dear aunt jemima said miss marjoribanks though she was a little puzzled
you are the only relative i have and i knew you would not forsake me
what should i do without you at such a time
i am sure it is what dear papa would have wished  lucilla cried mrs john impulsively i know it is natural you should cry for your father but when you know allyou that never knew what it was to be without moneythat never were straitened even or obliged to give up things like most other young women
oh my dear they said i was to prepare you but how can i prepare you
i feel as if i never could forgive my brotherinlaw that he should bring you up like this and then  what is it
said miss marjoribanks drying her tears
if it is anything new tell me but don't speak so ofofwhat is it
say it right out
lucilla said aunt jemima solemnly you think you have a great deal of courage and now is your time to show it
he has left you without a farthinghe that was always thought to be so rich
it is quite true what i am saying
he has gone and died and left nothing lucilla
now i have told you and oh my poor dear injured child cried mrs john with fervour as long as i have a home there will be room in it for you
but lucilla put her aunt away softly when she was about to fall upon her neck
miss marjoribanks was struck dumb her heart seemed to stop beating for the moment
it is quite impossibleit cannot be true she said and gave a gasp to recover her breath
then mrs john came down upon her with facts proving it to be trueshowing how dr marjoribanks's money was invested and how it had been lost
she made a terrible muddle of it no doubt but lucilla was not very clear about business details any more than her aunt and she did not move nor say a word while the long involved endless narrative went on
she kept saying it was impossible in her heart for half of the time and then she crept nearer the fire and shivered and said nothing even to herself and did not even seem to listen but knew that it must be true
it would be vain to attempt to say that it was not a terrible blow to lucilla her strength was weakened already by grief and solitude and want of food for she could not find it in her heart to go on eating her ordinary meals as if nothing had happened and all of a sudden she felt the cold seize her and drew closer and closer to the fire
the thoughts which she had been thinking in spite of herself and for which she had so greatly condemned herself went out with a sudden distinctness as if it had been a lamp going out and leaving the room in darkness and a sudden sense of utter gloom and cold and bewildering uncertainty came over lucilla
when she lifted her eyes from the fire into which she had been gazing it almost surprised her to find herself still in this warm room where there was every appliance for comfort and where her entire wardrobe of new mourningeverything as aunt jemima said that a woman could desirewas piled up on the bed
it was impossible that she could be a penniless creature left on her own resources without father or supporter or revenue and yetgood heavens
could it be true
if it is true aunt jemima said lucilla i must try to bear it but my poor head feels all queer
i'd rather not think any more about it tonight
how can you help thinking about it lucilla
cried mrs john
i can think of nothing else and i am not so much concerned as you
upon which lucilla rose and kissed aunt jemima though her head was all confused and she had noises in her ears
i don't think we are much like each other you know she said
did you hear how mrs chiley was
i am sure she will be very sorry and with that miss marjoribanks softened and felt a little comforted and cried againnot for the money but for her father
if you are going downstairs i think i will come down to tea aunt jemima she said
but after mrs john had gone away full of wonder at her philosophy lucilla drew close to the fire again and took her head between her hands and tried to think what it meant
could it be true
instead of the heiress in a good position who could go abroad or anywhere and do anything she liked was it possible that she was only a penniless single woman with nobody to look to and nothing to live on
such an extraordinary incomprehensible revolution might well make any one feel giddy
the solid house and the comfortable room and her own sober brain which was not in the way of being put off its balance seemed to turn round and round as she looked into the fire
lucilla was not one to throw the blame upon her father as mrs john had done
on the contrary she was sorry profoundly sorry for him and made such a picture to herself of what his feelings must have been when he went into his room that night and knew that all his hardearned fortune was gone that it made her weep the deepest tears for him that she had yet shed
poor papa
she said to herself and as she was not much given to employing her imagination in this way and realising the feeling of others the effect was all the greater now
if he had but told her and put off a share of the burden from his own shoulders on to hers who could have borne it
but the doctor had never done justice to lucilla's qualities
this amid her general sense of confusion and dizziness and insecurity was the only clear thought that struck miss marjoribanks and that it was very cold and must be freezing outside and how did the poor people manage who had not all her present advantages
she tried to put away this revelation from her as she had said to aunt jemima and keep it for a little at arm's length and get a night's rest in the meantime and so be able to bring a clear head to the contemplation of it tomorrow which was the most judicious thing to do
but when the mind has been stimulated by such a shock solomon himself one would suppose could scarcely however clearly he might perceive what was best take the judicious passive way
when lucilla got up from where she was crouching before the fire she felt so giddy that she could scarcely stand
her head was all queer as she had said and she had a singing in her ears
she herself seemed to have changed along with her position
an hour or two before she could have answered for her own steadiness and selfpossession in almost any circumstances but now the blood seemed to be running a race in her veins and the strangest noises hummed in her ears
she felt ashamed of her weakness but she could not help it and then she was weak with grief and excitement and comparative fasting which told for something probably in her inability to bear so unlookedfor a blow
but miss marjoribanks thought it was best to go down to the drawingroom for tea as she had said
to see everything just as it had been utterly indifferent and unconscious of what had happened made her cry and relieved her giddiness by reviving her grief and then the next minute a bewildering wonder seized her as to what would become of this drawingroom the scene of her triumphswho would live in it and whom the things would go towhich made her sick and brought back the singing in her ears
but on the whole she took tea very quietly with aunt jemima who kept breaking into continual snatches of lamentation but was always checked by lucilla's composed looks
if she had not heard this extraordinary news which made the world turn round with her miss marjoribanks would have felt that soft hush of exhaustion and grief subdued which when the grief is not too urgent comes after all is over and even now she felt a certain comfort in the warm firelight and the change out of her own roomwhere she had been living shut up with the blinds down and the black dresses everywhere about for so many dreary days
john brown who had charge of dr marjoribanks's affairs came next day and explained everything to lucilla
the lawyer had had one short interview with his client after the news came and dr marjoribanks had borne it like a man
his face had changed a little and he had sat down which he was not in the habit of doing and drawn a kind of shivering long breath and then he had said poor lucilla
to himself
this was all mr brown could say about the effect the shock had on the doctor
and there was something in this very scanty information which gave lucilla a new pang of sorrow and consolation
and he patted me on the shoulder that last night she said with tender tears and felt she had never loved her father so well in all her lifewhich is one of the sweeter uses of death which many must have experienced but which belonged to a more exquisite and penetrating kind of emotion than was common to lucilla
i thought he looked a little broken when he went out said mr brown but full of pluck and spirit as he always was
'i am making a good deal of money and i may live long enough to lay by a little still' were the last words he said to me
i remember he put a kind of emphasis on the may
perhaps he knew he was not so strong as he looked
he was a good man miss marjoribanks and there is nobody that has not some kind thing to tell of him said the lawyer with a certain moisture in his eyes for there was nobody in carlingford who did not miss the old doctor and john brown was very tenderhearted in his way
but nobody can know what a good father he was said lucilla with a sob and she meant it with all her heart thinking chiefly of his hand on her shoulder that last night and of the poor lucilla
in john brown's office though after all perhaps it was not chiefly as a tender father that dr marjoribanks shone though he gave his daughter all she wanted or asked for
her grief was so true and so little tinctured by any of that indignation over the unexpected loss which aunt jemima had not been able to conceal that john brown was quite touched and felt his heart warm to lucilla
he explained it all very fully to her when she was composed enough to understand him and as he went through all the details the giddiness came back and once more miss marjoribanks felt the world running round and heard his statement through the noises in her ears
all this settled down however into a certain distinctness as john brown who was very clearheaded and good at making a concise statement went on and gradually the gyrations became slower and slower and the great universe became solid once more and held to its moorings under lucilla's feet and she ceased to hear that supernatural hum and buzz
the vague shadows of chaos and ruin dispersed and through them she saw once more the real aspect of things
she was not quite penniless
there was the house which was a very good house and some little corners and scraps of money in the funds which were lucilla's very own and could not be lost and last of all there was the businessthe best practice in carlingford and entire command of grange lane
but what does that matter
said lucilla if poor papa had retired indeed as i used to beg him to do and parted with itbut everybody has begun to send for dr rider already she said in an aggrieved voice and then for the first time john brown remembered to his confusion that there was once said to be something between miss marjoribanks and dr rider which complicated the affair in the most uncomfortable way
yes he said and of course that would make it much more difficult to bring in another man but rider is a very honourable young fellow miss marjoribanks  he is not so very young said lucilla
he is quite as old as i am though no one ever would think so
i am sure he is honourable but what has that to do with it
and i do think mrs chiley might have done withoutanybody else for a day or two considering when it was  and here she stopped to cry unreasonably but yet very naturally for it did feel hard that in the house to which dr marjoribanks's last visit had been paid another doctor should have been called in next day
what i meant to say said john brown was that dr rider though he is not rich and could not pay a large sum of money down would be very glad to make some arrangement
he is very anxious about it and he seemed himself to think that if you knew his circumstances you would not be disinclined tobut as i did not at all know  lucilla caught as it were and met and forced to face her her informant's embarrassed hesitating look
you say this said miss marjoribanks because people used to say there was something between us and you think i may have some feeling about it
but there never was anything between us
anybody with a quarter of an eye could have seen that he was going out of his senses about that little australian girl
and i am rather fond of men that are in loveit shows they have some good in them
but it is dreadful to talk of such things now said lucilla with a sigh of selfreproach
if dr rider has any arrangement to propose i should like to give him the preference please
you see they have begun to send for him already in grange lane
i will do whatever you think proper said john brown who was rather scared and very much impressed by miss marjoribanks's candour
dr rider had been the first love of mr brown's own wife and the lawyer had a curious kind of satisfaction in thinking that this silly young fellow had thus lost two admirable women and that probably the little australian was equally inferior to miss marjoribanks and mrs brown
he ought to have been grateful that dr rider had left the latter lady to his own superior discriminationand so he was and yet it gave him a certain odd satisfaction to think that the doctor was not so happy as he might have been
he went away fully warranted to receive dr rider's proposition and even to a certain extent to decide upon itand lucilla threw herself back in her chair in the silent drawingroom from which aunt jemima had discreetly withdrawn and began to think over the reality of her position as she now saw it for the first time
the sense of bewildering revolution and change was over for strangely enough the greater a change is the more easily the mind after the first shock accepts and gets accustomed to it
it was over and the world felt steady once more under lucilla's feet and she sat down not precisely amid the ruins of her happiness but still in the presence of many an imagination overthrown to look at her real position
it was not after all utter poverty misery and destitution as at the first glance she had believed
according to what john brown had said and a rapid calculation which lucilla had herself made in passing something approaching two hundred a year would be left to herjust a small single woman's revenue as she thought to herself
two hundred a year
all at once there came into miss marjoribanks's mind a sudden vision of the two miss ravenswoods who had lived in that pretty set of rooms over elsworthy's shop facing into grange lane and who had kept a lady's maid and asked the best people in the place to tea upon a very similar income and how their achievements had been held up to everybody as a model of what genteel economy could do
she thought of them and her heart sank within her for it was not in lucilla's nature to live without a sphere nor to disjoin herself from her fellowcreatures nor to give up entirely the sovereign position she had held for so many years
whatever she might ultimately do it was clear that in the meantime she could not make up her mind to any such giving up of the battle as that
and then there was the house
she might let it to the riders and add probably another hundred a year to her income for though it was an excellent house and worth more than a hundred a year still there was no competition for houses in grange lane and the new doctor was the only probable tenant
and to tell the truth though lucilla was very reasonable it went to her heart at the present moment to think of letting the house to the new doctor and having the patients come as usual and the lamp lighted as of old and nothing changed except the central figure of all
she ought to have been above such sentimental ideas when a whole hundred pounds a year was in question but she was not which of itself was a strange phenomenon
if she could have made up her mind to that there were a great many things that she might have done
she might still have gone abroad and to some extent taken a limited share in what was going on in some section of english society on the continent
or she might have gone to one of the mild centres of a similar kind of life in england
but such a prospect did not offer many attractions to miss marjoribanks
if she had been rich it would have been different
thus there gradually dawned upon her the germ of the plan she ultimately adopted and which was the only one that commended itself to her feelings
going away was expensive and troublesome at the best and even at elsworthy's if she could have made up her mind to such an expedient she would have been charged a pound a week for the rooms alone not to speak of all kinds of extras and never having the satisfaction of feeling yourself in your own place
under all the circumstances it was impressed upon lucilla's mind that her natural course was to stay still where she was and make no change
why should she make any change
the house was her own and did not cost anything and if nancy would but stand by her and one good maidit was a venture but still lucilla felt as if she might be equal to it
though she was no mathematician miss marjoribanks was very clever at mental arithmetic in a practical sort of way
she put down lines upon lines of figures in her head while she sat musing in her chair and worked them out with wonderful skill and speed and accuracy
and the more she thought of it the more it seemed to her that this was the thing to do
why should she retreat and leave her native soil and the neighbourhood of all her friends because she was poor and in trouble
lucilla was not ashamed of being poornor even frightened by it now that she understood what it wasany more than she would have been frightened after the first shock had her poverty even been much more absolute
she was standing alone at this moment as upon a little island of as yet undisturbed seclusion and calm and she knew very well that outside a perfect sea of good advice would surge round her as soon as she was visible
in these circumstances lucilla took by instinct the only wise course she made up her mind there and then with a perfect unanimity which is seldom to be gained when counsellors are admitted
and what she decided upon as was to be expected from her character was not to fly from her misfortune and the scene of it but to confront fate and take up her lawful burden and stay still in her own house
it was the wisest and the easiest and at the same time the most heroic course to adopt and she knew beforehand that it was one which would be approved of by nobody
all this lucilla steadily faced and considered and made up her mind to while she sat alone although silence and solitude and desolation seemed to have suddenly come in and taken possession all around her of the once gay and brilliant room
she had just made her final decision when she was rejoined by her aunt who everybody said was at this trying moment like a mother to lucilla
yet aunt jemima too had changed a little since her brotherinlaw's death
she was very fond of miss marjoribanks and meant every word she had said about giving her a home and still meant it
but she did not feel so certain now as she had done about tom's love for his cousin nor at all anxious to have him come home just at this moment and for another thing she had got a way of prowling about the house and looking at the furniture in a speculative auctioneering sort of way
it must be all sold of course aunt jemima had said to herself and i may as well look what things would suit me there is a little chiffonier that i have always wanted for my drawingroom and lucilla would like to see a few of the old things about her poor dear
with this idea mrs john gave herself a great deal of unnecessary fatigue and gave much offence to the servants by making pilgrimages all over the house turning up at the most unlikely places and poking about in the least frequented rooms
it was a perfectly virtuous and even amiable thing to do for it was better as she reasoned that they should go to her than to a stranger and it would be nice for lucilla to feel that she had some of the old things about her but then such delicate motives are seldom appreciated by the homely critics downstairs
it was with something of this same air that she came into the drawingroom where lucilla was
she could not help laying her hand in a suggestive sort of way on a small table which she had to pass as if she were saying to herself as indeed she was saying the veneer has been broken off at that side and the foot is mended it will bring very little and yet it looks well when you don't look too close
such were the ideas with which aunt jemima's mind was filled
but yet she came forward with a great deal of sympathy and curiosity and forgot about the furniture in presence of her afflicted niece
did he tell you anything lucilla
said mrs john of course he must have told you somethingbut anything satisfactory i mean
i don't know if you can call it satisfactory said lucilla with a sudden rush of softer thoughts but it was a comfort to hear it
he told me something about dear papa aunt jemima
after he had heard of that you knowall that he said was poor lucilla
and don't you remember how he put his hand on my shoulder that last night
i am sosoglad he did it sobbed miss marjoribanks
it may be supposed it was an abrupt transition from her calculations but after all it was only a different branch of the same subject and lucilla in all her life had never before shed such poignant and tender tears
he might well say poor lucilla
said mrs johnbrought up as you have been my dear and did not you hear anything more importanti mean more important in a worldly point of view aunt jemima added correcting herself of course it must be the greatest comfort to hear something about your poor papa
and then lucilla unfolded john brown's further particulars to her surprised hearer
mrs john lived upon a smallish income herself and she was not so contemptuous of the two hundred a year
and the house she saidthe house would bring you in another hundred lucilla
the riders i am sure would take it directly and perhaps a great part of the furniture too
three hundred would not be so bad for a single woman
did you say anything about the furniture my dear
aunt jemima added half regretfully for she did feel that she would be sorry to lose that chiffonier
i think i shall stay in the house said lucilla you may think it silly aunt jemima but i was born in it and  stay in the house
mrs john said with a gasp
she did not think it silly but simple madness and so she told her niece
if lucilla could not make up her mind to elsworthy's there was brighton and bath and cheltenham and a hundred other places where a single woman might be very comfortable on three hundred a year
and to lose a third part of her income for a piece of sentiment was so utterly unlike any conception aunt jemima had ever formed of her niece
it was unlike miss marjoribanks but there are times of life when even the most reasonable people are inconsistent
lucilla though she felt it was open to grave criticism felt only more confirmed in her resolution by her aunt's remarks
she heard a voice aunt jemima could not hear and that voice said stay
chapter xlv   it must be allowed that lucilla's decision caused very general surprise in carlingford where people had been disposed to think that she would be rather glad now that things were so changed to get away
to be sure it was not known for some time but everybody's idea was that being thus left alone in the world and in circumstances so reduced miss marjoribanks naturally would go to live with somebody
perhaps with her aunt who had something though she was not rich perhaps after a little to visit about among her friends of whom she had so many
nobody doubted that lucilla would abdicate at once and a certain uneasy yet delicious sense of freedom had already stolen into the hearts of some of the ladies in grange lane
they lamented it is true the state of chaos into which everything would fall and the dreadful loss miss marjoribanks would be to society but still freedom is a noble thing and lucilla's subjects contemplated their emancipation with a certain guilty delight
it was at the same time a most fertile subject of discussion in carlingford and gave rise to all those lively speculations and consultations and oftrenewed comparing of notes which take the place of bets in the feminine community
the carlingford ladies as good as betted upon lucilla whether she would go with her aunt or pay mrs beverley a visit at the deanery or retire to mount pleasant for a little where those good old miss blounts were so fond of her
each of these opinions had its backers if it is not profane to say so and the discussion which of them miss marjoribanks would choose waxed very warm
it almost put the election out of people's heads and indeed the election had been sadly damaged in interest and social importance by the sad and most unexpected event which had just happened in grange lane
but when the fact was really known it would be difficult to describe the sense of guilt and horror which filled many innocent bosoms
the bound of freedom had been prematureliberty and equality had not come yet notwithstanding that too early unwise lan of republican satisfaction
it was true that she was in deep mourning and that for a year at least society must be left to its own devices and it was true also that she was poorwhich might naturally be supposed a damper upon her energiesbut at the same time carlingford knew its lucilla
as long as she remained in grange lane even though retired and in crape the constitutional monarch was still present among her subjects and nobody could usurp her place or show that utter indifference to her regulations which some revolutionaries had dreamed of
such an idea would have gone direct in the face of the british constitution and the sense of the community would have been dead against it
but everybody who had speculated upon her proceedings disapproved of lucilla in her most unlookedfor resolution
some could not think how she could bear it staying on there when everything was so changed and some said it was a weakness they could never have believed to exist in her and somefor there are spiteful people everywherebreathed the names of cavendish and ashburton the rival candidates and hinted that miss marjoribanks had something in her mind to justify her lingering
if lucilla had not been supported by a conscious sense of rectitude she must have broken down before this universal disapprobation
not a soul in the world except one supported her in her resolution and that was perhaps of all others the one least likely to be able to judge
and it was not for want of opportunity to go elsewhere
aunt jemima as has been seen did not lose an instant in offering the shelter of her house to her niece and mrs beverley wrote the longest kindest most incoherent letter begging her dear lucilla to come to her immediately for a long visit and adding that though she had to go out a good deal into society she needn't mind for that everything she could think of would be done to make her comfortable to which dr beverley himself who was now a dean added an equally kind postscript begging miss marjoribanks to make her home at the deanery until she saw how things were to be
he would have found me a place perhaps lucilla said when she folded up the letterand this was a terrible mode of expression to the genteel ears of mrs john
i wish you would not use such words my dear said aunt jemima even if you had been as poor as you thought my house would always have been a home for you
thank heaven i have enough for both you never needed to have thought under any circumstances of taking aa situation
it is a thing i could never have consented towhich was a very handsome thing of aunt jemima to say
thank you aunt said lucilla but she sighed for though it was very kind what was miss marjoribanks to have done with herself in such a dowager establishment
and then colonel chiley came in who had also his proposal to make
she sent me the colonel said it's been a sad business for us all lucilla i don't know when i have felt anything more and as for her you know she has never held up her head since  dear mrs chiley
miss marjoribanks said unable to resist the old affection and yet i heard she had sent for dr rider directly lucilla added
she knew it was quite natural and perhaps quite necessary but then it did seem hard that his own friends should be the first to replace her dear papa
it was i did that said the colonel
what was a man to do
i was horribly cut up but i could not stand and see her making herself worse and i said you had too much sense to mind  so i ought said lucilla with penitence but when i remembered where he was last the very last place  it was hard upon the colonel to stand by and see a woman cry
it was a thing he could never stand as he had always said to his wife
he took the poker which was his favourite resource and made one of his tremendous dashes at the fire to give lucilla time to recover herself and then he turned to aunt jemima who sat pensively by  she sent me said the colonel who did not think his wife needed any other namenot that i would not have come of my own accord we want lucilla to go to us you see
i don't know what plans she may have been making but we're both very fond of hershe knows that
i think if you have not settled upon anything the best that lucilla can do is to come to us
she'll be the same as at home and always somebody to look after her  the old colonel was standing before the fire wavering a little on his long unsteady old legs and looking wonderfully well preserved and old and feeble and lucilla though she was in mourning was so full of life and force in her way
it was a curious sort of protection to offer her and yet it was real protection and love and succour though heaven knows
it might not perhaps last out the year
i am sure colonel chiley it is a very kind offer said aunt jemima and i would have been thankful if she could have made up her mind to go with me
but i must say she has taken a very queer notion into her heada thing i should never have expected from lucillashe says she will stay here
hereahehwhat does she mean by here
said the colonel
here colonel chiley in this great big melancholy house
i have been thinking about it and talking about it till my head goes round and round
unless she were to take inmates said aunt jemima in a resigned and doleful voice
as for the colonel he was petrified and for a long time had not a word to say
hereby jove i think she must have lost her senses said the old soldier
why lucilla ii thoughtwasn't there something about the money being lost
you couldn't keep up this house under afifteen hundred a year at least the doctor spent a mint of moneyyou must be going out of your senses
and to have all the sick people coming and the bell ringing of nights
bless my soul
it would kill anybody said colonel chiley
put on your bonnet and come out with me shutting her up here and letting her cry and so forthi don't say it ain't naturali'm terribly cut up myself whenever i think of it but it's been too much for her head said the colonel with anxiety and consternation mingling in his face
unless she were to take inmates you know said aunt jemima in a sepulchral voice
there was something in the word that seemed to carry out to a point of reality much beyond anything he had dreamt of the suggestion colonel chiley had just made
inmates
lord bless my soul
what do you mean ma'am
said the old soldier
lucilla put on your bonnet directly and come and have a little fresh air
she'll soon be an inmate herself if we leave her here the colonel said
they were all very sad and grave and yet it was a droll scene and then the old hero offered lucilla his arm and led her to the door
you'll find me in the hall as soon as you are ready he said in tones half gruff half tender and was glad to go downstairs though it was cold and put on his greatcoat with the aid of thomas and stand warming the tips of his boots at the hall fire
as for lucilla she obeyed him without a word and it was with his unsteady but kind old arm to lean upon that she first saw how the familiar world looked through the mist of this strange change that had come over it and through the blackness of her crape veil
but though she succeeded in satisfying her friends that she had made up her mind she did not secure their approval
there were so many objections to her plan
if you had been rich even i don't think i should have approved of it lucilla mrs chiley said with tears and i think we could have made you happy here
so the good old lady spoke looking round her pretty room which was so warm and cheery and bright and where the colonel neat and precise as if he had come out of a box was standing poking the fire
it looked all very solid and substantial and yet it was as unstable as any gossamer that the careless passenger might brush away
the two good people were so old that they had forgotten to remember they were old
but neither did lucilla think of that
this was really what she thought and partly said  i am in my own house that wants no expense nor changing and nancy is getting old and does not mind standing by me
and it is not so much trouble after all keeping everything nice when there is no gentleman coming in and nothing else to do
and besides i don't mean to be lucilla marjoribanks for ever and ever
this was the general scope without going into all the details of what lucilla said
but at the same time though she was so happy as not to be disturbed in her decision or made uncomfortable either by lamentation or remonstrance and had no doubt in her mind that she was doing right it was disagreeable to miss marjoribanks to go thus in the face of all her friends
she went home by herself and the house did look dreary from the outside
it was just as it had always been for none of the servants were dismissed as yet nor any external change made but still a look as if it had fallen asleepa look as if it too had died somehow and only pretended to be a house and homewas apparent in the aspect of the place and when the servants were gone and nobody remained except lucilla and her faithful nancy and a young maidwhich must be the furthest limit of miss marjoribanks's household and difficult enough to maintain upon two hundred a yearwhat would it look like
this thought was more discouraging than any remonstrances and it was with a heavy heart that lucilla reentered her solitary house
she told thomas to follow her upstairs and when she sank tired into a chair and put up her veil before commencing to speak to him it was all she could do to keep from crying
the depressing influences of this sad week had told so much on her that she was quite fatigued by her walk to see mrs chiley and thomas too knew why he had been called and stood in a formal manner before her with his hands crossed against the closed door
when she put back her thick black veil the last climax of painful change came upon miss marjoribanks
she did not feel as if she were lucilla so discouraged and depressed and pale and tired with her walk as she was with all sorts of projects and plans so quenched out of her almost if she had been charged with being somebody else the imputation was one which she could not have denied
thomas she said faintly i think i ought to speak to you myself about all that has happenedwe are such old friends and you have been such a good kind servant
you know i shan't be able to keep up  and sorry we all was miss to hear it said thomas when lucilla's utterance failed
i am sure there never was a better master though particular and for a comfortabler house  if i had been as poor papa expected to leave me said miss marjoribanks after a little pause everything would have gone on as usual but after your long service here and so many people as know you thomas you will have no difficulty in getting as good a place and you know that anything i can say  thank you miss said thomas and then he made a pause
it was not exactly that as i was thinking of i've set my heart this many a day on a little business
if you would be so kind as to speak a word for me to the gentlemen as has the licensing
there ain't nobody as knows better how  what kind of a business thomas
said lucilla who cheered up a little in ready interest and would have been very glad if she could have taken a little business too
well miss a kind of a quietpublichouse if i don't make too bold to name it said thomas with a deprecating airnot one of them drinkingplaces miss as i know ladies can't abide but many a man as is a very decent man wants his pint o' beer now and again and their little sort of clubs of a night as well as the gentlefolks and it's my opinion miss as it's a man's dooty to see as that sort of thing don't go too far and yet as his fellowcreatures has their bit of pleasure said thomas who naturally took the defensive side
i am sure you are quite right said lucilla cheering up more and more and instinctively with her old statesmanlike breadth of view throwing a rapid glance upon the subject to see what capabilities there might be in it and i hope you will try always to exercise a good influencewhat is all that noise and shouting out of doors
it's one of the candidates miss said thomas as is addressing of the bargemen at the top o' prickett's lane
ah
said lucilla and a deep sigh escaped from her bosom
but you cannot do anything of that kind you know thomas without a wife
yes miss said thomas with great confusion and embarrassment that was just what i was going to say
me and betsy  betsy
said lucilla with dismay for it had been betsy she had specially fixed upon as the handy willing cheerful maid who when there was no gentleman coming in and little else to do might keep even this big house in order
she sighed but it was not in her power even if she had desired it to put any restriction upon betsy's wishes
and it was not without a momentary envy that she received the intelligence
it was life the housemaid was about to enter onactive life of her own with an object and meaningclogged by thomas no doubt who did not appear to lucilla as the bright spot in the picturebut still independent life whereas her mistress knew of nothing particularly interesting in her own uncertain future
she was roused from her momentary meditation by the distant shouts which came from the top of prickett's lane and sighed again without knowing it as she spoke
it's a pity you had not got yourlittle inn said lucilla for the sake of euphony six months or a year ago for then you might have voted for mr ashburton thomas
i had forgotten about the election until now
not as that needn't stand in the way miss said thomas eagerly there's betsy's brother as has it now and he ain't made up his mind about his vote and if he knowed as it would be any comfort to you  of course it will be a comfort to me
said miss marjoribanks and she got up from her chair with a sense that she was still not altogether useless in the world
go and speak to him directly thomas and here's one of mr ashburton's colours that i made up myself and tell him that there can be no doubt he is the man for carlingford and send up nancy to me
and i hope betsy and you will be very happy said lucilla
she had been dreadfully down but the rebound was all the more grateful
i am not done with yet and thank heaven
there must always be something to do she said to herself when she was alone
and she threw off her shawl and began to make the drawingroom look like itself not that it was not perfectly in order and as neat as a room could be but still the neatness savoured of betsy and not of lucilla
miss marjoribanks in five minutes made it look like that cosy empire of hospitality and kindness and talk and wit and everything pleasant that it used to be and then when she had finished she sat down and had a good cry which did not do her any harm
then nancy appeared disturbed in her preparations for dinner and with her arms wrapped in her apron looking glum and defiant
hers was not the resigned and resourceful preparation for her fate which had appeared in thomas
she came in and put the door ajar and leant her back against the sharp edge
she might be sent off like the rest if that was miss lucilla's meaningher that had been in the house off and on for more than thirty years but if it was so at least she would not give up without unfolding a bit of her mind
come in said lucilla drying her eyescome in and shut the door you had better come and sit down here nancy for i have a great deal to say and i want to speak to you as a friend
nancy shut the door but she thought to herself that she knew what all this meant and made but a very little movement into the room looking more forbidding than ever
thank you all the same miss lucilla but i ain't too old to stand she said and stood firm to meet the shock with her arms folded under her apron thinking in her heart that it was about one of the almshouses her horror and hope that her young mistress was going to speak
nancy said lucilla i want to tell you what i am going to do
i have to make up my mind for myself now
they all go against me and one says i should do this and another says i should do that but i don't think anybody knows me so well as you do
don't stand at the door
i want to consult you as a friend
i want to ask you a question and you must answer as if you were before a judgei have such confidence in you
nancy's distrust and defiance gave way a little before this appeal
she came a step nearer and let the apron drop from her folded arms
what is it miss lucillathough i ain't pretending to be one to advise she said building a kind of intrenchment round her with the nearest chairs
you know how things are changed said lucilla and that i can't stay here as i used to do
people think i should go and live with somebody but i think you knowif i was one of those ladies that have a faithful old servant to stand by them and never to grumble nor make a fuss nor go back on the past nor go in for expensive dishesone that wouldn't mind cooking a chop or making a cup of tea if that was all we could affordwhy i think nancy  but nancy could not hear any more
she made a little rush forward with a kind of convulsive chuckling that was half sobbing and half laughter
and me here
cried dr marjoribanks's famous cook who had spent a fortune on her gravybeef alone and was one of the most expensive people in carlingfordme as has done for you all your days
me as wouldif it was but a roast potato
cried the devoted woman
she was in such a state of hysterical flutter and excitement that lucilla had to take her almost into her arms and put the old woman into a chair and bring her to which was an occupation quite in miss marjoribanks's way
but i shall only have two hundred a year said lucilla
now don't be rash there will have to be a maid to keep things tidy and that is every farthing i shall have
you used to spend as much in gravybeef said miss marjoribanks with a sigh
oh miss lucilla let bygones be bygones said nancy with tears
if i did it wasn't without many a little something for them as was too poor to buy it for themselvesfor i never was one as boiled the senses out of a bit of meat and when a gentleman is welltodo and hasn't got no occasion to count every pennythe doctor i will say for him was never one as asked too many questions
give him a good dinner on his own table and he wasn't the gentleman as grudged a bit of broken meat for the poor folks
he did a deal of good as you nor no one never know'd of miss lucilla said nancy with a sob
and then his daughter and his faithful old servant cried a little in company over dr marjoribanks's vacant place
what could a man have more
nobody was made altogether desolate by his death nor was any heart broken but they wept for him honestly though the old woman felt happy in her sorrow
and lucilla on her knees before the fire told nancy of that exclamation the doctor had made in john brown's office and how he had put his hand on her shoulder that last night
all he said was poor lucilla
sobbed miss marjoribanks he never thought of himself nor all his money that he had worked so hard for and once more that touch of something more exquisite than was usual to her went sharply down into lucilla's heart and brought up tenderer and deeper tears
she felt all the better for it after and was even a little cheerful in the evening and like herself and thus it will be seen that one person in carlingfordnot it is true a popular oracle but of powerful influence and firstrate importance in a practical point of viewgave the heartiest approbation to miss marjoribanks's scheme for her new life
chapter xlvi   lucilla's calculations were fully justified by the result
twenty times in a day she recognised the wisdom of her own early decision which was made while she was still by herself and before anybody had come in to advise her
if she had left it over until the time when though much shaken she was understood to be able to see her friends it is just possible that the whirlwind of popular opinion which raged about her might have exercised a distracting influence even upon miss marjoribanks's clear head and steady judgment
for even now though they saw her in her own house in her mourning people would not believe that it was true and that lucilla actually intended to make no change and all that tide of good advice which had been flowing through carlingford ever since the doctor's death in the form of opinion now rushed in upon her notwithstanding that all the world knew that she had made up her mind
everybody says you are going to stay on but we do hope it is not true lucilla her friends said in many voices
it is dreadful for us to lose you but you never could bear it dear
and this was repeated so often that if miss marjoribanks had been weakminded she must have ended by believing not only that it was more than she was equal to but more than she ought to be equal towhich was a more touching argument still
you are excited now miss brown said who had a great deal of experience in family troubles one always is at such a time but when things have settled down in their ordinary way then you will find it is more than you can bear
i think it is always best to make a change
if you were to travel a little you know  but my dear i am poor said lucilla
it doesn't require so much money when you know how to set about it said her adviser and there are so many people who would be glad to have you lucilla
and then you might settle a little at caen or tours or some of those nice places where there is such capital english society and everything so cheap or if you thought your health required it at pau or nice you know
you are looking quite pale and i don't think you were ever very strong in the chest lucilla and everything is so different on the continentone feels it the moment one crosses the channel there is something different in the very air
it smells different i know said lucilla meekly and then the conversation was interrupted by that afternoon cup of tea which nancy could not be got to think was an extravagance and around which to tell the truth the grange lane ladies began to resume their habit of gatheringthough miss marjoribanks of course was still quite unequal to societyas in the old times
and unless it is for a very short time lucilla mrs centum said who had joined them you never can keep it up you know
i could not pretend to afford nancy for my part and when a cook is extravagant she may promise as faithfully as you please and make good resolutions and all that but when it is in her lucillai am sure one or two receipts she has given me have been quite ridiculous
you don't like to give in i know but you'll be driven to give in and if she does not get you into debt as well you will be very lucky
i know what it is
with my family you know a week of nancy would make an end of me
and the worst of all is said lady richmond who had driven in expressly to add her mite to the treasure of precious counsel of which miss marjoribanks was making so little use that i am sure lucilla is overestimating her strength
she will find after that she is not equal to it you know all the associationsand the people coming at night to ask for the doctorandand all that
i know it would kill me
dear lady richmond said lucilla making a desperate stand and setting as it were her back against a rock don't you think i can bear it best here where you are all so kind to me and where everybody was so fond ofof him
you can't think what a comfort it is to me said lucilla with a sob to see all the hatbands upon the gentlemen's hats
and then there was a pause for this was an argument against which nobody could find anything to say
for my part i think the only thing she can do is to take inmates said aunt jemima
if i were obliged to leave she would be so very lonely
i have known ladies do it who were in a very good position and it made no difference people visited them all the same
she could say 'in consequence of changes in the family' or 'a lady who has a larger house than she requires' which i am sure is quite true
it goes to one's heart to think of all these bedrooms and only one lady to sleep in them allwhen so many people are so hampered for want of room
or she might say 'for the sake of society' for i am sure if i should have to go away  but i hope you are not going away
it would be so sad for lucilla to be left alone said lady richmond who took a serious view of everything at such a time
oh no
aunt jemima said faltering a little and then a pink blush which seemed strangely uncalled for in such a mild little teaparty came over her mature countenance but then one can never tell what may happen
i might have other dutiesmy son might make a call upon my time
not that i know of anything at present she added hurriedly but i never can bind myself on account of tom  and then she caught lucilla's eye and grew more confused than ever
what could she have to be confused about
if tom did make a call upon her time whatever that might mean there was nothing in it to call a blush upon his mother's face
and the fact was that a letter had come from tom a day or two before of which contrary to all her usual habits aunt jemima had taken no notice to lucilla
these were things which would have roused miss marjoribanks's curiosity if she had been able to think about anything as she said
but her visitors were taking their cup of tea all the time in a melancholy halfsympathetic halfdisapproving way and they could not be expected to see anything particularly interesting in aunt jemima's blush
and then rose lake came in from grove street who was rather an unusual visitor and whose appearance though they were all very kind and gracious to her rather put the others to flight for nobody had ever quite forgotten or forgiven barbara's brief entrance into society and flirtation with mr cavendish which might be said to have been the beginning of all that happened to him in grange lane
as for mrs centum she took her leave directly and pressed lucilla's hand and could not help saying in her ear that she hoped the other was not coming back to carlingford to throw herself in poor mr cavendish's way
it would do him so much harm mrs centum said anxiously but oh
i forgot lucilla you are on the other side
i am on no side now said miss marjoribanks with plaintive meaning and barbara was as old as i am you know and she must have gone off
i have no doubt she has gone off said mrs centum with righteous indignation
as old as you lucilla
she must be ten years older at least and such a shocking style of looksif men were not so infatuated
and you have not gone off at all my poor dear she added with all the warmth of friendship
and then they were joined at the door by the county lady who was the next to go away
my dear i hope you will be guided for the best lady richmond said as she went away but she gave a deep sigh as she kissed lucilla and looked as if she had very little faith in the efficacy of her own wish
maria brown had withdrawn to another part of the drawingroom with aunt jemima so that lucilla was so to speak left alone with rose
and rose too had come with the intention of giving advice
i hear you are going to stay lucilla she said and i did not think i would be doing my duty if i did not tell you what was in my mind
i can't do any good to anybody you know but you who are so clever and have so much in your power  i am poor now said miss marjoribanks and as for being clever i don't know about that
i never was clever about drawing or art like you
oh like me
said poor little rose whose career had been sacrificed ten years ago and who was a little misanthropical now and did not believe even in schools of design i am not so sure about the moral influence of art as i used to beexcept high art to be sure but we never have any high art down here
and oh lucilla
the poor people do want something done for them
if i was as clever as you and with a great house all to myself like this and well off and with plenty of influence and no ties said rose with energetic emphasis
she made a pause there and she was so much in earnest that the tears came into her eyes
i would make it a house of mercy lucilla
i would show all these poor creatures how to live and how to manage if i was as clever as you and teach them and their children and look after them and be a mother to them
said rose and here she stopped short altogether overcome by her own magnificent conception of what her friend could or might do
aunt jemima and miss brown who had drawn near out of curiosity stared at rose as if they thought she had gone mad but lucilla who was of a larger mind and more enlightened ideas neither laughed nor looked horrified
she did not make a very distinct answer it is true but she was very kind to her new adviser and made her a fresh cup of tea and even consented though in an ambiguous way to the principle she had just enunciated if you won't be affronted my dear lucilla said i do not think that art could do very much in carlingford and i am sure any little thing that i may be of use for but she did not commit herself any further and rose too found the result of her visit unsatisfactory and went home disappointed in lucilla
this was how the afternoon passed and at the end of such a day it may well be imagined how miss marjoribanks congratulated herself on having made up her mind before the public so to speak were admitted
for rose was followed by the rector who though he did not propose in so many words a house of mercy made no secret of his conviction that parishwork was the only thing that could be of any service to lucilla and that in short such was the inevitable and providential destination of a woman who had no ties
indeed to hear mr bury a stranger would have been disposed to believe that dr marjoribanks had been as he said removed and his fortune swept away all in order to indicate to lucilla the proper sphere for her energies
in the face of all this it will be seen how entirely miss marjoribanks's wisdom in making her decision by herself before her advisers broke in upon her was justified
she could now set her back against her rock and face her assailants as fitzjames did
come one come all this rock shall fly     from its firm base as soon as i  might have been her utterance but she was not in a defiant mood
she kissed all her counsellors that day except of course the rector and heard them out with the sweetest patience and then she thought to herself how much better it was that she had made up her mind to take her own way
notwithstanding all this commotion of public opinion about her made a certain impression upon miss marjoribanks's mind
it was not unpleasant to feel that for this moment at least she was the centre of the thoughts of the community and that almost everybody in carlingford had taken the trouble to frame an ideal existence for her according as he or she regarded life
it is so seldom that any one has it in his power consciously and evidently to regulate his life for himself and make it whatever he wants it to be
and then at the same time the best that she could make of it would after all be something very limited and unsatisfactory
in her musings on this subject lucilla could not but go back a great many times to that last conversation she had with her father when she walked up grange lane with him that night over the thawed and muddy snow
the doctor had said she was not cut out for a single woman and lucilla with candour yet a certain philosophical speculativeness had allowed that she was notunless indeed she could be very rich
if she had been very rich the prospect would no doubt have been to a certain extent different
and then oddly enough it was rose lake's suggestion which came after this to lucilla's mind
she did not smile at it as some people might expect she would
one thing was quite sure that she had no intention of sinking into a nobody and giving up all power of acting upon her fellowcreatures and she could not help being conscious of the fact that she was able to be of much use to her fellowcreatures
if it had been maria brown for instance who had been concerned the whole question would have been one of utter unimportance except to the heroine itself but it was different in miss marjoribanks's case
the house of mercy was not a thing to be taken into any serious consideration but still there was something in the idea which lucilla could not dismiss carelessly as her friends could
she had no vocation such as the foundress of such an establishment ought to have nor did she see her way to the abandonment of all projects for herself and that utter devotion to the cause of humanity which would be involved in it but yet when a woman happens to be full of energy and spirit and determined that whatever she may be she shall certainly not be a nonentity her position is one that demands thought
she was very capable of serving her fellowcreatures and very willing and well disposed to serve them and yet she was not inclined to give herself up entirely to them nor to relinquish her personal prospectsvague though these might be
it was a tough problem and one which might have caused a most unusual disturbance in lucilla's wellregulated mind had not she remembered all at once what deep mourning she was in and that at present no sort of action either of one kind or another could be expected of her
there was no need for making a final decision either about the parishwork or about taking inmates as aunt jemima proposed or about any other single suggestion which had been offered to her no more than there was any necessity for asking what her cousin tom's last letter had been about or why his mother looked so guilty and embarrassed when she spoke of him
grief has its privileges and exemptions like other great principles of life and the recollection that she could not at present be expected to be able to think about anything filled lucilla's mind with the most soothing sense of consolation and refreshing calm
and then other events occurred to occupy her friends the election for one thing began to grow a little exciting and took away some of the superfluous energy of grange lane
mr ashburton had carried all before him at first but since the rector had come into the field the balance had changed a little
mr bury was very lowchurch and from the moment at which he was persuaded that mr cavendish was a great penitent the question as to which was the man for carlingford had been solved in his mind in the most satisfactory way
a man who intrenched himself in mere respectability and trusted in his own good character and considered himself to have a clear conscience and to have done his duty had no chance against a repentant sinner
mr cavendish perhaps had not done his duty quite so well but then he was penitent and everything was expressed in that word
the rector was by no means contemptible either as an adversary or a supporterand the worst of it was that in embracing mr cavendish's claims he could scarcely help speaking of mr ashburton as if he was in a very bad way
and feeling began to rise rather high in carlingford
if anything could have deepened the intensity of miss marjoribanks's grief it would have been to know that all this was going on and that affairs might go badly with her candidate while she was shut up and could give no aid
it was hard upon her and it was hard upon the candidates themselvesone of whom had thus become generally disapproved of without so far as he knew doing anything to deserve it while the other occupied the still more painful character of being on his promotiona repentant man with a character to keep up
it was no wonder that mrs centum grew pale at the very idea of such a creature as barbara lake throwing herself in poor mr cavendish's way
a wrong step one way or othera relapse into the ways of wickednessmight undo in a moment all that it had cost so much trouble to do
and the advantage of the rector's support was thus grievously counterbalanced by what might be called the uncertainty of itespecially as mr cavendish was not as his committee lamented secretly among themselves a man of strong will or business habits in whom implicit confidence could be placed
he might get restive and throw the rector over just at the critical moment or he might relapse into his lazy continental habits and give up churchgoing and other good practices
but still up to this moment he had shown very tolerable perseverance and mr bury's influence thrown into his scale had equalised matters very much and made the contest very exciting
all this lucilla heard not from mr cavendish but from her own candidate who had taken to calling in a steady sort of way
he never went into any effusions of sympathy for he was not that kind of man but he would shake hands with her and say that people must submit to the decrees of providence and then he would speak of the election and of his chances
sometimes mr ashburton was despondent and then lucilla cheered him up and sometimes he had very good hopes
i am very glad you are to be here he said on one of these occasions
it would have been a great loss to me if you had gone away
i shall never forget our talk about it here that day and how you were the first person that found me out
it was not any cleverness of mine said lucilla
it came into my mind in a moment like spiritrapping you know
it seems so strange to talk of that now there have been such changes since thenit looks like years
yes said mr ashburton in his steady way
there is nothing that really makes time look so long but we must all bow to these dispensations my dear miss marjoribanks
i would not speak of the election but that i thought it might amuse you
the writs are out now you know and it takes place on monday week
upon which miss marjoribanks smiled upon mr ashburton and held out her hands to him with a gesture and look which said more than words
you know you will have all my best wishes she said and the candidate was much movedmore moved than at such a moment he had thought it possible to be
if i succeed i know whom i shall thank the most he said fervently and then as this was a climax and it would have been a kind of bathos to plunge into ordinary details after it mr ashburton got up still holding lucilla's hand and clasped it almost tenderly as he said goodbye
she looked very well in her mourning though she had not expected to do so for black was not lucilla's style
and the fact was that instead of having gone off as she herself said miss marjoribanks looked better than ever she did and was even embellished by the natural tears which still shone by times in her eyes
mr ashburton went out in a kind of bewilderment after this interview and forgot his overcoat in the hall and had to come back for it which was a confusing circumstance and then he went on his way with a gentle excitement which was not unpleasant
would she i wonder
he said to himself as he went up grange lane
perhaps he was only asking himself whether lucilla would or could be present along with lady richmond and her family at the window of the blue boar on the great day but if that was it the idea had a certain brightening and quickening influence upon his face and his movements
the doubt he had on the subject whatever it was was not a discouraging but a piquant stimulating exciting doubt
he had all but proposed the question to his committee when he went in among them which would have filled these gentlemen with wonder and dismay
but though he did not do that he carried it home with him as he trotted back to the firs to dinner
mr ashburton took a walk through his own house that evening and examined all its capabilitieswith no particular motive as he was at pains to explain to his housekeeper and again he said to himself would she i wonder
before he retired for the night which was no doubt an unusual sort of iteration for so sensible a man and one so fully occupied with the most important affairs to make
as for lucilla she was not in the way of asking herself any questions at that moment
she was letting things take their course and not interfering and consequently nothing that happened could be said to be her fault
she carried this principle so far that even when aunt jemima was herself led to open the subject in a hesitating way miss marjoribanks never even asked a single question about tom's last letter
she was in mourning and that was enough for her
as for appearing at the window of the blue boar with lady richmond if that was what mr ashburton was curious about he might have saved himself the trouble of any speculations on the subject
for though miss marjoribanks would be very anxious about the election she would indeed have been ashamed of herself could her feelings have permitted her to appear anywhere in public so soon
thus while mr ashburton occupied himself much with the question which had taken possession of his mind lucilla took a good book which seemed the best reading for her in her circumstances and when she had looked after all her straitened affairs in the morning sat down sweetly in the afternoon quiet of her retirement and seclusion and let things take their way
chapter xlvii   as the election approached it became gradually the one absorbing object of interest in carlingford
the contest was so equal that everybody took a certain share in it and became excited as the decisive moment drew nigh
most of the people in grange lane were for mr ashburton but then the rector who was a host in himself was for mr cavendish and the coquetting of the dissenting interest which was sometimes drawn towards the liberal sentiments of the former candidate but sometimes could not help reflecting that mr ashburton dealt in george street and the fluctuations of the bargemen who were many of them freemen and a very difficult part of the population excited the most vivid interest
young mr wentworth who had but lately come to carlingford had already begun to acquire a great influence at wharfside where most of the bargees lived and the steady ones would no doubt have been largely swayed by him had his inclinations been the same as the rector's but mr wentworth perversely enough had conceived that intuitive repugnance for mr cavendish which a highprincipled and not very tolerant young man often feels for the middleaged individual who still conceives himself to have some right to be called young and whose antecedents are not entirely beyond suspicion
mr wentworth's disinclination and he was a man rather apt to take his own way lay like a great boulder across the stream of the rector's enthusiasm and unquestionably interrupted it a little
both the candidates and both the committees had accordingly work enough to do up to the last moment
mr cavendish all at once became a connoisseur in hams and gave a magnificent order in the most complimentary way to tozer who received it with a broad smile and booked it as he said
it ain't ham he's a wanting the butterman said not without amusement for tozer was welltodo and except that he felt the honour of a mark of confidence was not to be moved one way or another by one order
if he dealt regular it might be different
them's the sort of folks as a man feels drawn to said the true philosopher
mr ashburton on the other side did not make the impression which his friends thought he ought to have made in prickett's lane but at least nobody could say that he did not stick very close to his work
he went at it like a man night and day and neglected no means of carrying it to a successful issue whereas as mr centum and mr woodburn mourned in secret to each other cavendish required perpetual egging on
he did not like to get up in the morning and get early to his work
it went against all his habitsas if his habits mattered in the face of so great an emergency and in the afternoon it was hard to prevent him from lounging into some of his haunts which were utterly out of the way of business
he would stay in masters's for an hour at a time though he knew mr wentworth who was masters's great patron did not care for him and that his favour for such a tractarian sort of place was bitter to the rector
anything for a little idleness and waste of time poor mr centum said who was two stone lighter on the eve of the election than when the canvass began
such a contrast would make any man angry
mr cavendish was goaded into more activity as the decisive moment approached and performed what seemed to himself unparalleled feats
but it was only two days before the moment of fate when the accident happened to him which brought such dismay to all his supporters
our own opinion is that it did not materially affect the issue of the contest one way or other but that was the reverse of the feeling which prevailed in grange lane
it was just two days before the election and all seemed going on sufficiently well
mr cavendish had been meeting a dissenting committee and it was on leaving them that he found himself at the corner of grove street where under ordinary circumstances he had no occasion to be
at a later period he was rather fond of saying that it was not of his own motion that he was there at all but only in obedience to the committee which ordered him about like a nigger
the spring afternoon was darkening and the dissenters almost wholly unimpressed by his arguments and remarking more strongly than ever where mr ashburton dealt and how thoroughly everybody knew all about him had all dispersed
it was but natural when mr cavendish came to the corner of grove street where in other days he had played a very different part that certain softening influences should take possession of his soul
what a voice she had by jove
he said to himself very different from that shrill pipe of lucilla's
to tell the truth if there was one person in carlingford whom he felt a resentment against it was lucilla
she had never done him any harm to speak of and once she had unquestionably done him a great deal of good
but on the other hand it was she who first showed herself candidly conscious that he had grown stout and who all along had supported and encouraged his rival
it was possible no doubt that this might be pique and mixed with his anger for her sins against him mr cavendish had at the same time a counterbalancing sense that there still remained to him in his life one supereminently wise thing that he still could doand that was to go down grange lane instantly to the doctor's silenced house and go down on his knees or do any other absurdity that might be necessary to make lucilla marry him after which act he would henceforward be pecuniarily and otherwise notwithstanding that she was poor a saved man
it did not occur to him that lucilla would never have married him even had he gone down on his knees but perhaps that would be too much to ask any man to believe of any woman and his feeling that this was the right thing to do rather strengthened than otherwise the revolt of his heart against lucilla
it was twilight as we have said and he had done a hard day's work and there was still an hour before dinner which he seemed to have a right to dispose of in his own way and he did hesitate at the corner of grove street laying himself open as it were to any temptation that might offer itself
temptations come as a general rule when they are sought and thus on the very eve of the election a grievous accident happened to mr cavendish
it might have happened at any time to be sure but this was the most inopportune moment possible and it came accordingly now
for as he made that pause some one passed him whom he could not but look after with a certain interest
she went past him with a whisk as if she too was not without reminiscences
it was not such a figure as a romantic young man would be attracted by on such a sudden meeting and it was not attraction but recollection that moved mr cavendish
it was the figure of a large woman in a large shawl not very gracefully put on and making her look very square about the shoulders and bunchy at the neck and the robe that was whisked past him was that peculiar kind of faded silk gown which looks and rustles like tin or some other thin metallic substance
he made that momentary pause at the street corner and then he went on slowly not following her to be sure but merely as he said to himself pursuing his own course for it was just as easy to get into grange lane by the farther end as by this end
he went along very slowly and the lady before him walked quickly even with something like a bounce of excitement and went in at mr lake's door long before mr cavendish reached it
when he came up on a level with the parlour window which was partially open though the evening was so cold mr cavendish positively started notwithstanding the old associations which had been rising in his mind for there was pouring forth from the halfopen window such a volume of melody as had not been heard for years in grove street
perhaps the voice had lost some of its freshness but in the surprise of the moment the hearer was not critical and its volume and force seemed even greater than before
it has been already mentioned in this history that a contralto had a special charm for mr cavendish
he was so struck that he stood stockstill for the moment not knowing what to make of it and then he wavered for another moment with a sudden sense that the old allegorical crisis had occurred to him and that pleasure in a magnificent gush of song wooed him on one side while duty with still small voice called him at the other
he stood still he waveredfor fifty seconds perhaps the issue was uncertain and the victim was still within reach of salvation but the result in such a case depends very much upon whether a man really likes doing his duty which is by no means an invariable necessity
mr cavendish had in the abstract no sort of desire to do his unless when he could not help it and consequently his resistance to temptation was very feeble
he was standing knocking at mr lake's door before half the thoughts appropriate to the occasion had got through his mind and found himself sitting on the little sofa in mr lake's parlour as he used to do ten years ago before he could explain to himself how he came there
it was all surely a kind of enchantment altogether
he was therehe who had been so long away from carlingfordhe who had been so deeply offended by hearing his name seriously coupled with that of barbara lakehe who ought to have been anywhere in the world rather than here upon the eve of his election when all the world was keeping watch over his conduct
and it was barbara who sat at the piano singingsinging one of the same songs as if she had spent the entire interval in that occupation and never had done anything else all these years
the sensation was so strange that mr cavendish may be excused for feeling a little uncertainty as to whether or not he was dreaming which made him unable to answer himself the graver question whether or not he was doing what he ought to do
he did not seem to be able to make out whether it was now or ten years agowhether he was a young man free to amuse himself or a man who was getting stout and upon whom the eyes of an anxious constituency were fixed
and then after being so virtuous for a length of time a forbidden pleasure was sweet
mr cavendish's ideas however gradually arranged themselves as he sat in the corner of the little haircloth sofa and began to take in the differences as well as the bewildering resemblances of the present and past
barbara like himself had changed
she did not insult him as lucilla had done by fresh looks and mischievous candour about going off
barbara had gone off like himself and like himself did not mean to acknowledge it
she had expanded all over as was natural to a contralto
her eyes were blacker and more brilliant in a way but they were eyes which owned an indescribable amount of usage and her cheeks too wore the deep roses of old deepened and fixed by wear and tear
instead of feeling ashamed of himself in her presence as he had done in lucilla's mr cavendish felt somehow consoled and justified and sympathetic
poor soul
he said to himself as he sat by while she was singing
she too had been in the wars and had not come out scatheless
she did not reproach him nor commiserate him nor look at him with that mixture of wonder and tolerance and pity which other people had manifested
she did not even remark that he had grown stout
he was not a man fallen fallen fallen from his high estate to barbara
she herself had fallen from the pinnacles of youth and mr cavendish was still a great man in her eyes
she sang for him as she had sung ten years ago and received him with a flutter of suppressed delight and in her satisfaction was full of excitement
the hardworked candidate sank deeper and deeper into the corner of the sofa and listened to the music and felt it very soothing and pleasant for everybody had united in goading him on rather than petting him for the last month or two of his life
now tell me something about yourself he said when the song was over and barbara had turned round as she used to do in old times on her musicstool i hear you have been away like me
not like you said barbara for you went because you pleased and i went  why did you go
asked mr cavendish
because i could not stay here any longer said barbara with her old vehemence because i was talked about and looked down upon andwell never mind that's all over now and i am sure i am very glad to see you mr cavendish as a friend
and with that something like a tear came into her eye
she had been knocked about a good deal in the world and though she had not learned much still she had learned that she was young no longer and could not indulge in the caprices of that past condition of existence
mr cavendish for his part could not but smile at this intimation that he was to be received as a friend and consequently need not have any fear of barbara's fascinationsas if a woman of her age worn and gone off as she was could be supposed dangerous but still he was touched by her tone
we were once very good friends barbara said the inconsistent man we have lost sight of each other for a long time as people do in this world but we were once very good friends
yes she said with a slight touch of annoyance in her voice but since we have lost sight of each other for so long i don't see why you should call me barbara
it would be much more becoming to say miss lake
mr cavendish was amused and he was touched and flattered
most people had been rather forbearing to him since he came back putting up with him for old friendship's sake or supporting his cause as that of a reformed man and giving him on the whole a sort of patronising humiliating countenance and to find somebody in whose eyes he was still the paladin of old times the mr cavendish whom people in grange lane were proud of was balm to his wounded soul
i don't know how i am to learn to say miss lakewhen you are just as good to me as ever and sing as you have just been doing he said
i suppose you say so because you find me so changed
upon which barbara lifted her black eyes and looked at him as she had scarcely done before
the eyes were as bright as ever and they were softened a little for the moment out of the stare that seemed to have grown habitual to them and her crimson cheeks glowed as of old and though she was untidy and looked worn and like a creature much buffeted about by wind and waves she was still what connoisseurs in that article call a fine woman
she looked full at mr cavendish and then she cast down her eyes as if the sight was too much for her
i don't see any difference she said with a certain tremor in her voice for he was a man of whom in the days of her youth she had been fond in her way
and naturally mr cavendish was more touched than ever
he took her hand and called her barbara again without any reproof and he saw that she trembled and that his presence here made to the full as great an impression as he had ever done in his palmiest days
perhaps a greater impression for their old commerce had been stormy and interrupted by many a hurricane and barbara then had or thought she might have many strings to her bow and did not believe that there was only one mr cavendish in the world
now all that was changed and if this old hope should revive again it would not be allowed to die away for any gratification of temper
mr cavendish did not remember ever to have seen her tremble before and he too was fond of her in his way
this curious revival did not come to anything of deeper importance for of course just then rose came in from her household affairs and mr lake to tea and the candidate recollected that it was time for dinner
but father and sister also gave him in their different ways a rather flattering reception
mr lake had already pledged him his vote and was full of interest as to how things were going on and enthusiastic for his success and rose scowled upon him as of old as on a dangerous character whose comings and goings could not be seen without apprehension which was an unexpected pleasure to a man who had been startled to find how very little commotion his presence made in grange lane
he pressed barbara's hand as he went away and went to his dinner with a heart which certainly beat lighter and a more pleasant sense of returning selfconfidence than he had felt for a long time
when he was coming out of the house as a matter of course he met with the chief of his dissenting supporters accompanied for mr bury as has been said was very lowchurch and loved wherever he could do it to work in unison with his dissenting brethren by the rector's churchwarden both of whom stopped with a curiously critical air to speak to the candidate who had to be every man's friend for the time being
the look in their eyes sent an icy chill through him but still the forbidden pleasure had been sweet
as he walked home he could not help thinking it over and going back ten years and feeling a little doubtful about it whether it was then or now
and as he mused miss marjoribanks whom he could not help continually connecting and contrasting with the other appeared to him as a kind of jealous queen eleanor who had a right to him and could take possession at any time should she choose to make the effort while barbara was a rosamond dilapidated indeed but always ready to receive and console him in her bower
this was the kind of unconscious sentiment he had in his mind feeling sure as he mused that lucilla would be very glad to marry him and that it would be very wise on his part to ask her and was a thing which might still probably come to pass
of course he could not see into miss marjoribanks's mind which had travelled such a long way beyond him
he gave a glance up at the windows as he passed her door and felt a kind of disagreeable satisfaction in seeing how diminished the lights were in the once radiant house
and lucilla was so fond of a great deal of light
but she could not afford now to spend as much money upon wax as a continental church might do
mr cavendish had so odd a sense of lucilla's power over him that it gave him a certain pleasure to think of the coming down of her pride and diminution of her lights
but the fact was that not more than ten minutes after he had passed her door with this reflection lucilla sitting with her good book on the table and her work in her hand in the room which was not so well lighted as it used to be heard that mr cavendish had been met with coming out of mr lake's and that barbara had been singing to him and that there was no telling what might have happened
a man ain't the man for carlingford as takes up with that sort thomas said indignantly who had come to pay his former mistress a visit and to assure her of his brotherinlaw's vote
he was a little more freespoken than of old being now set up and an independent householder and calling no man master and he was naturally indignant at an occurrence which regarded in the light of past events was an insult not only to carlingford but to lucilla
miss marjoribanks was evidently startled by the news
she looked up quickly as if she had been about to speak and then stopped herself and turned her back upon thomas and poked the fire in a most energetic way
she had even taken the hearthbrush in her hand to make all tidy after this onslaught but that was a thing that went to thomas's heart
i couldn't stand by and see it miss lucilla said thomas it don't feel natural and there was actually a kind of moisture in his eye as he took that domestic implement out of her hand
mr cavendish pitied lucilla for having less light than of old and thomas for being reduced so low as to sweep her own hearth
but lucilla was very far from pitying her own case
she had been making an effort over herself and she had come out of it triumphant after reading so many good books it is not to be wondered at if she felt herself a changed and softened and elevated character
she had the means in her hands of doing her candidate's rival a deadly mischief and yet for old friendship's sake lucilla made up her mind to forbear
i will give it you thomas she said with dignity holding the hearthbrush which was in such circumstances elevated into something sublime if you will promise never until after the electionnever to say a word about mr cavendish and miss lake
it was quite right to tell me and you are very kind about the hearth but you must promise never to say a syllable about it not even to nancy until the election is over or i will never give it you nor ask you to do a single thing for me again
thomas was so much struck with this address that he said good lord
in sheer amazement and then he made the necessary vow and took the hearthbrush out of lucilla's hand
no doubt he was asking for mr lake's vote said miss marjoribanks
they say everybody is making great exertions and you know they are both my friends
i ought to be pleased whoever wins
but it is impressed on my mind that mr ashburton will be the man lucilla added with a little solemnity and thomas we must give them fairplay
it would be vain to assert that thomas understood this romantic generosity but he was taken by surprise and had relinquished his own liberty in the matter and had nothing further to say
indeed he had so little to say downstairs that nancy who was longing for a little gossip insulted and reviled him and declared that since he took up with that betsy there never was a sensible word to be got out of him
and all the time the poor man was burning with this bit of news
many a man has bartered his freewill before under the influence of female wiles or so at least history would have us believe but few have done it for so poor a compensation as that hearthbrush
thomas withdrew sore at heart longing for the election to be over and kept his word like an honest man but notwithstanding before the evening was over the fatal news was spreading like fire to every house in grange lane
chapter xlviii   it is probable that mr cavendish considered the indulgence above recorded all the more excusable in that it was saturday night
the nomination was to take place on monday and if a man was not to be supposed to be done with his work on the saturday evening when could he be expected to have a moment of repose
he had thought as he went homefor naturally while putting himself so skilfully in the way of temptation such questions had not entered into his mindthat the fact of tomorrow being sunday would effectually neutralise any harm he could have been supposed to have done by a visit so simple and natural and that neither his sister nor his committee the two powers of which he stood in a certain awe could so much as hear of it until the election was over and all decided for good or for evil
this had been a comfort to his mind but it was the very falsest and most deceitful consolation
that intervening sunday was a severer calamity for mr cavendish than half a dozen ordinary days
the general excitement had risen so high and all the chances on both sides had been so often discussed and debated that something new was as water in the desert to the thirsting constituency
the story was all through grange lane that very night but carlingford itself from st roque's to the wilderness of the north end tingled with it next morning
it is true the rector made no special allusion to it in his sermon though the tone of all his services was so sad and his own fine countenance looked so melancholy that mr bury's devoted followers could all see that he had something on his mind
but mr tufton at salem chapel was not so reticent
he was a man quite famous for his extempore gifts and who rather liked to preach about any very recent public event which it was evident to all his hearers could not have found place in a prepared discourse and his sermon that morning was upon wickedness in high places upon men who sought the confidence of their fellows only to betray it and offered to the poor man a hand red with his sister's metaphorical blood
but it would be wrong to say that this was the general tone of public opinion in grove street most people on the contrary thought of mr cavendish not as a wolf thirsting for the lamb's blood but rather himself as a kind of lamb caught in the thicket and about to be offered up in sacrifice
such was the impression of a great many influential persons who had been wavering hitherto and inclining on the whole to mr cavendish's liberal principles and supposed lowchurch views
a man whose hand is red metaphorically with your sister's blood is no doubt a highly objectionable personage but it is doubtful whether under the circumstances an enlightened constituency might not consider the man who had given a perfectly unstained hand to so thoroughly unsatisfactory a sister as more objectionable still and the indignation of grange lane at barbara's reappearance was nothing to the fury of george street and even of wharfside where the bargees began to scoff openly
society had nothing worse to say than to quote mrs chiley and assert that these artist people were all adventurers and then grange lane in general could not forget that it had met barbara nor dismiss from its consideration her black eyes her level brows and her magnificent contralto whereas in the other region the idea of the member for carlingford marrying that sort
cast all the world into temporary delirium
it was a still more deadly offence to the small people than to the great
and the exceptional standing which poor mr lake and his daughter rose used to lay claim tothe rank of their own which they possessed as artistswas a pretension much more disagreeable to the shopkeepers than to society in general
thus in every sense mr cavendish had done the very worst for himself by his illtimed indulgence and his guilt was about the same with most of his critics whether he meant perfectly well and innocently or entertained the most guilty intentions ever conceived by man
and all his misfortunes were increased by the fact that the intervening day was a sunday
barbara lake herself who did not know what people were saying and who if she had known would not have cared came to church as was natural in the morning and under pretence that the family pew was full had the assurance as people remarked to come to the middle aisle in that same silk dress which rustled like tin and made more demonstration than the richest draperies
the pewopener disapproved of her as much as everybody else did but she could not turn the intruder out and though barbara had a long time to wait and was curiously inspected by all the eyes near her while she did so the end was that she got a seat in her rustling silk not very far from where lucilla sat in deep mourning a model of every righteous observance
as for poor barbara she too was very exemplary in church
she meant nobody any harm poor soul
she could not help the flashing of those big black eyes to which the level line above them gave such a curious appearance of obliquenessnor was it to be expected that she should deny herself the use of her advantages or omit to take the second in all the canticles with such melodious liquid tones as made everybody stop and look round
she had a perfect right to do it indeed it was her duty as it is everybody's duty to aid to the best of their ability in the churchmusic of their parish which was what lucilla marjoribanks persisted in saying in answer to all objections
but the effect was great in the congregation and even the rector himself was seen to change colour as his eye fell upon the unlucky young woman
mr cavendish for his part knew her voice the moment he heard it and gave a little start and received such a look from his sister who was standing by him as turned him to stone
mrs woodburn looked at him and so did her husband and mr centum turned a solemnly inquiring reproachful gaze upon him from the other side of the aisle
oh harry you will kill me with vexation
why for goodness' sake did you let her come
his sister whispered when they had all sat down again
good heavens
how could i help it
cried poor mr cavendish almost loud enough to be heard
and then by the slight almost imperceptible hum around him he felt that not only his sister and his committee but the rector and all carlingford had their eyes upon him and was thankful to look up the lesson poor man and bury his face in it
it was a hard punishment for the indiscretion of an hour
but perhaps of all the people concerned it was the rector who was the most to be pitied
he had staked his honour upon mr cavendish's repentance and here was he going back publicly to wallow in the mireand it was sunday when such a worldly subject ought not to be permitted to enter a good man's mind much less to be discussed and acted upon as it ought to be if anything was to be done for there was little more than this sacred day remaining in which to undo the mischief which a too great confidence in human nature had wrought
and then to tell the truth the rector did not know how to turn back
it would have been hard very hard to have told all the people who confided in him that he had never had any stronger evidence for mr cavendish's repentance than he now had for his backsliding and to give in and let the other side have it all their own way and throw over the candidate with whom he had identified himself was as painful to mr bury as if instead of being very lowchurch he had been the most muscular of christians
being in this state of mind it may be supposed that his sister's mild wonder and trembling speculations at lunch when they were alone together were well qualified to raise some sparks of that old adam who though well kept under still existed in the rector's as in most other human breasts
but dear edward i would not quite condemn him miss bury said
he has been the cause of a good deal of remark you know and the poor girl has been talked about
he may think it is his duty to make her amends
for anything we can tell he may have the most honourable intentions  oh bother his honourable intentions
said the rector
such an exclamation from him was as bad as the most dreadful oath from an ordinary man and very nearly made miss bury drop from her chair in amazement
things must have gone very far indeed when the rector himself disregarded all proprieties and the sacredness of the day in such a wildlydaring fashion
for to tell the truth in his secret heart mr bury was himself a little of the way of thinking of the people in grove street
strictly speaking if a man has done anything to make a young woman be talked about every wellprincipled person ought to desire that he should make her amends but at the same time at such a crisis there was little consolation in the fact that the candidate one was supporting and doing daily battle for had honourable intentions in respect to barbara lake
if it had been rose lake it would still have been a blow but rose was unspeakably respectable and nobody could have said a syllable on the subject while barbara who came to church in a tin gown and rustled up the middle aisle in it attracting all eyes and took such a second in the canticles that she overwhelmed the choir itselfbarbara who had made people talk at lucilla's parties and had been ten years away wandering over the face of the earth nobody could tell wheregovernessing singing playacting perhaps for anything that anybody could tell
a clergyman it is true dared not have said such a thing and mr bury's remorse would have been bitter could he have really believed himself capable even of thinking it but still it is certain that the unconscious unexpressed idea in his mind was that the honourable intentions were the worst of itthat a candidate might be a fool or even an unrepentant sinner and after all it would be chiefly his own concern but that so much as to dream of making barbara lake the member's wife was the deepest insult that could be offered to carlingford
the rector carried his burden silently all day and scarcely opened his lips as all his sympathetic following remarked but before he went to bed he made a singular statement the complete accuracy of which an impartial observer might be disposed to doubt but which mr bury uttered with profound sincerity and with a sigh of selfcompassion
now i understand lucilla marjoribanks was what the good man said and he all but puffed out the candle he had just lighted with that sigh
lucilla however in her own person took no part in it at all one way or other
she shook hands very kindly with barbara and hoped she would come and see her and made it clearly apparent that she at least bore no malice
i am very glad i told thomas to say nothing about it she said to aunt jemima who however did not know the circumstances and was very little the wiser as may be supposed
and then the two ladies walked home together and miss marjoribanks devoted herself to her good books
it was almost the first moment of repose that lucilla had ever had in her busy life and it was a repose not only permitted but enjoined
society which had all along expected so much from her expected now that she should not find herself able for any exertion and miss marjoribanks responded nobly as she had always done to the requirements of society
to a mind less perfectly regulated the fact that the election which had been so interesting to her was now about as may be said to take place without her would have been of itself a severe trial and the sweet composure with which she bore it was not one of the least remarkable phenomena of the present crisis
but the fact was that this sunday was on the whole an oppressive day
mr ashburton came in for a moment it is true between services but he himself though generally so steady was unsettled and agitated
he had been bearing the excitement well until this last almost incredible accident occurred which made it possible that he might not only win but win by a large majority
the dissenters have all held out till now and would not pledge themselves he said to lucilla actually with a tremble in his voice and then he told her about mr tufton's sermon and the wickedness in high places and the hand imbrued metaphorically in his sister's blood
i wonder how he could say so said lucilla with indignation
it is just like those dissenters
what harm was there in going to see her
i heard of it last night but even for your interest i would never have spread such mere gossip as that
nocertainly it is mere gossip said mr ashburton but it will do him a great deal of harm all the same and then once more he got restless and abstracted
i suppose it is of no use asking you if you would join lady richmond's party at the blue boar
you could have a window almost to yourself you know and would be quite quiet
lucilla shook her head and the movement was more expressive than words
i did not think you would said mr ashburton and then he took her hand and his looks too became full of meaning
then i must say adieu he saidadieu until it is all over
i shall not have a moment that i can call my ownthis will be an eventful week for me
you mean an eventful day said lucilla for mr ashburton was not such a novice as to be afraid of the appearance he would have to make at the nomination
he did not contradict her but he pressed her hand with a look which was equivalent to kissing it though he was not romantic enough to go quite that length
when he was gone miss marjoribanks could not but wonder a little what he could mean by looking forward to an eventful week
for her own part she could not but feel that after so much excitement things would feel rather flat for the rest of the week and that it was almost wrong to have an election on a tuesday
could it be that mr ashburton had some other contest or candidateship in store for himself which he had not told her about
such a thing was quite possible but what had lucilla in her mourning to do with worldly contingencies
she went back to her seat in the corner of the sofa and her book of sermons and read fifty pages before teatime she knew how much because she had put a mark in her book when mr ashburton came in
marks are very necessary things generally in sermonbooks and lucilla could not but feel pleased to think that since her visitor went away she had got over so much ground
to compare carlingford to a volcano that night and indeed all the next day which was the day of nomination would be a stale similitude and yet in some respects it was like a volcano
it was not the same kind of excitement which arises in a town where politics run very highif there are any towns nowadays in such a state of unsophisticated nature
neither was it a place where simple corruption could carry the day for the freemen of wharfside were after all but a small portion of the population
it was in reality a quite ideal sort of contesta contest for the best man such as would have pleased the purestminded philosopher
it was the man most fit to represent carlingford for whom everybody was looking not a man to be baited about parishrates and reform bills and the irish churcha man who lived in or near the town and dealt regular at all the best shops a man who would not disgrace his constituency by any unlawful or injudicious sort of lovemakingwho would attend to the town's interests and subscribe to its charities and take the lead in a general way
this was what carlingford was looking for as miss marjoribanks with that intuitive rapidity which was characteristic of her genius had at once remarked and when everybody went home from church and chapel though it was sunday the whole town thrilled and throbbed with this great question
people might have found it possible to condone a sin or wink at a mere backsliding but there were few so bigoted in their faith as to believe that the man who was capable of marrying barbara lake could ever be the man for carlingford and thus it was that mr cavendish who had been flourishing like a green baytree withered away as it were in a moment and the place that had known him knew him no more
the hustings were erected at that central spot just under the windows of the blue boar where grange lane and george street meet the most central point in carlingford
it was so near that lucilla could hear the shouts and the music and all the divers noises of the election but could not even when she went into the very corner of the window and strained her eyes to the utmost see what was going on which was a very trying position
we will not linger upon the proceedings or excitement of monday when the nomination and the speeches were made and when the show of hands was certainly thought to be in mr cavendish's favour
but it was the next day that was the real trial
lady richmond and her party drove past at a very early hour and looked up at miss marjoribanks's windows and congratulated themselves that they were so early and that poor dear lucilla would not have the additional pain of seeing them go past
but lucilla did see them though with her usual good sense she kept behind the blind
she never did anything absurd in the way of early rising on ordinary occasions but this morning it was impossible to restrain a certain excitement and though it did her no good still she got up an hour earlier than usual and listened to the music and heard the cabs rattling about and could not help it if her heart beat quicker
it was perhaps a more important crisis for miss marjoribanks than for any other person save one in carlingford for of course it would be foolish to attempt to assert that she did not understand by this time what mr ashburton meant and it may be imagined how hard it was upon lucilla to be thus as it were in the very outside row of the assemblyto hear all the distant shouts and sounds everything that was noisy and inarticulate and conveyed no meaning and to be out of reach of all that could really inform her as to what was going on
she saw from her window the cabs rushing past now with her own violetandgreen colours now with the blueandyellow
and sometimes it seemed to lucilla that the blueandyellow predominated and that the carriages which mounted the hostile standard carried voters in larger numbers and more enthusiastic condition
the first load of bargemen that came up grange lane from the farther end of wharf side were all blues and when a spectator is thus held on the very edge of the event in a suspense which grows every moment more intolerable especially when he or she is disposed to believe that things in general go on all the worse for his or her absence it is no wonder if that spectator becomes nervous and sees all the dangers at their darkest
what if after all old liking and friendship had prevailed over that beautiful optimism which lucilla had done so much to instil into the minds of her townsfolk
what if something more mercenary and less elevating than the ideal search for the best man in which she had hoped carlingford was engaged should have swayed the popular mind to the other side
all these painful questions went through lucilla's mind as the day crept on and her suspense was much aggravated by aunt jemima who took no real interest in the election but who kept saying every ten minutesi wonder how the poll is going oni wonder what that is they are shoutingis it 'ashburton for ever'
or 'cavendish for ever'
lucilla
your ears should be sharper than mine but i think it is cavendish
lucilla thought so too and her heart quaked within her and she went and squeezed herself into the corner of the window to try whether it was not possible to catch a glimpse of the field of battle and her perseverance was finally rewarded by the sight of the extremity of the wooden planks which formed the pollingbooth but there was little satisfaction to be got out of that
and then the continual dropping of aunt jemima's questions drove her wild
my dear aunt she said at last i can see nothing and hear nothing and you know as much about what is going on as i dowhich it will be acknowledged was not an answer such as one would have expected from lucilla's perfect temper and wonderful selfcontrol
the election went on with all its usual commotion while miss marjoribanks watched and waited
mr cavendish's committee brought their supporters very well up in the morningno doubt by way of making sure of them as somebody suggested on the other side and for some time mrs woodburn's party at masters's windows which masters had given rather reluctantly by way of pleasing the rector looked in better spirits and less anxious than lady richmond's party which was at the blue boar
towards noon mr cavendish himself went up to his female supporters with the bulletin of the pollthe same bulletin which mr ashburton had just sent down to lucilla
these were the numbers and they made masters's triumphant while silence and anxiety fell upon the blue boar      cavendish            ashburton         when miss marjoribanks received this disastrous intelligence she put the note in her pocket without saying a word to aunt jemima and left her window and went back to her worstedwork but as for mrs woodburn she gave her brother a hug and laughed and cried and believed in it like a silly woman as she was
it is something quite unlookedfor and which i never could have calculated upon she said thrusting her hand into an imaginary waistcoat with mr ashburton's very look and tone which was beyond measure amusing to all the party
they laughed so long and were so gay that lady richmond solemnly levelled her operaglass at them with the air of a woman who was used to elections but knew how such parvenus have their heads turned by a prominent position
that woman is taking some of us off she said but if it is me i can bear it
there is nothing so vulgar as that sort of thing and i hope you never encourage it in your presence my dears
just at that moment however an incident occurred which took up the attention of the ladies at the windows and eclipsed even the interest of the election
poor barbara lake was interested too to know if her friend would win
she was not entertaining any particular hopes or plans about him
years and hard experiences had humbled barbara
the brussels veil which she used to dream of had faded as much from her memory as poor rose's honiton design for which she had got the prize
at the present moment instead of nourishing the ambitious designs which everybody laid to her charge she would have been content with the very innocent privilege of talking a little to her next employers about mr cavendish the member for carlingford and his visits to her father's house
but at the same time she had once been fond of him and she took a great interest in him and was very anxious that he should win
and she was in the habit like so many other women of finding out as far as she could what was going on and going to see everything that there might be to see
she had brought one of her young brothers with her whose anxiety to see the fun was quite as great as her own and she was arrayed in the tin dressher best available garmentwhich was made long according to the fashion and which as barbara scorned to tuck it up was continually getting trodden on and talked about and reviled at on that crowded pavement
the two parties of ladies saw and even it might be said heard the sweep of the metallic garment which was undergoing such rough usage and which was her best poor soul
lady richmond had alighted from her carriage carefully tucked up though there were only a few steps to make and there was no lady in carlingford who would have swept a good gown over the stones in such a way but then poor barbara was not precisely a lady and thought it right to look as if it did not matter
she went up to read the numbers of the pollin the sight of everybody and she clasped her hands together with ecstatic satisfaction as she read and young carmine her brother dashed into the midst of the fray and shouted cavendish for ever
hurrah for cavendish
and could scarcely be drawn back again to take his sister home
even when she withdrew she did not go home but went slowly up and down grange lane with her rustling train behind her with the intention of coming back for further information
lady richmond and mrs woodburn both lost all thought of the election as they watched and lo
when their wandering thoughts came back again the tide had turned
the tide had turned
whether it was barbara or whether it was fate or whether it was the deadly unanimity of those dissenters who after all their wavering had at last decided for the man who dealt in george streetno one could tell but by two o'clock mr ashburton was so far ahead that he felt himself justified in sending another bulletin to lucillaso far that there was no reasonable hope of the opposite candidate ever making up his lost ground
mrs woodburn was not a woman to be content when reasonable hope was overshe clung to the last possibility desperately with a pertinacity beyond all reason and swore in her heart that it was barbara that had done it and cursed her with her best energies which however as these are not melodramatic days was a thing which did the culprit no possible harm
when barbara herself came back from her promenade in grange lane and saw the altered numbers she again clasped her hands together for a moment and looked as if she were going to faint and it was at that moment that mr cavendish's eyes fell upon her as ill fortune would have it
they were all looking at him as if it was his fault and the sight of that sympathetic face was consoling to the defeated candidate
he took off his hat before everybody probably as his sister afterwards said he would have gone and offered her his arm had he been near enough
how could anybody wonder after that that things had gone against him and that notwithstanding all his advantages he was the loser in the fight
as for lucilla she had gone back to her worstedwork when she got mr ashburton's first note in which his rival's name stood above his own
she looked quite composed and aunt jemima went on teasing with her senseless questions
but miss marjoribanks put up with it all though the lingering progress of these hours from one o'clock to four the sound of cabs furiously driven by the distant shouts the hum of indefinite din that filled the air exciting every moment a keener curiosity and giving no satisfaction or information would have been enough to have driven a less large intelligence out of its wits
lucilla bore it doing as much as she could of her worstedwork and saying nothing to nobody except indeed an occasional word to aunt jemima who would have an answer
she was not walking about grange lane repeating a kind of prayer for the success of her candidate as barbara lake was doing but perhaps on the whole barbara had the easiest time of it at that moment of uncertainty
when the next report came lucilla's fingers trembled as she opened it so great was her emotion but after that she recovered herself as if by magic
she grew pale and then gave a kind of sob and then a kind of laugh and finally put her worstedwork back into her basket and threw mr ashburton's note into the fire
it is all right said lucilla
mr ashburton is a hundred ahead and they can never make up that
i am so sorry for poor mr cavendish
if he only had not been so imprudent on saturday night
i am sure i don't understand you said aunt jemima
after being so anxious about one candidate how can you be so sorry for the other
i suppose you did not want them both to win
yes i think that was what i wanted said lucilla drying her eyes and then she awoke to the practical exigencies of the position
there will be quantities of people coming to have a cup of tea and i must speak to nancy she said and went downstairs with a cheerful heart
it might be said to be as good as decided so far as regarded mr ashburton and when it came for her final judgment what was it that she ought to say
it was very well that miss marjoribanks's unfailing foresight led her to speak to nancy for the fact was that after four o'clock when the polling was over everybody came in to tea
all lady richmond's party came as a matter of course and mr ashburton himself for a few minutes bearing meekly his new honours and so many more people besides that but for knowing it was a special occasion and that our gentleman was elected nancy's mind never could have borne the strain
and the tea that was used was something frightful
as for aunt jemima who had just then a good many thoughts of her own to occupy her and did not care so much as the rest for all the chatter that was going on nor for all those details about poor barbara and mr cavendish's looks which lucilla received with such interest she could not but make a calculation in passing as to this new item of fashionable expenditure into which her niece was plunging so wildly
to be sure it was an occasion that never might occur again and everybody was so excited as to forget even that lucilla was in mourning and that such a number of people in the house so soon might be more than she could bear
and she was excited herself and forgot that she was not able for it
but still aunt jemima sitting by could not help thinking that even fiveo'clock teas of good quality and unlimited amount would very soon prove to be impracticable upon two hundred a year
chapter xlix   mr ashburton it may be supposed had but little time to think on that eventful evening and yet he was thinking all the way home as he drove back in the chilly spring night to his own house
if his further course of action had been made in any way to depend upon the events of this day it was now settled beyond all further uncertainty and though he was not a man in his first youth nor a likely subject for a romantic passion still he was a little excited by the position in which he found himself
miss marjoribanks had been his inspiring genius and had interested herself in his success in the warmest and fullest way and if ever a woman was made for a certain position lucilla was made to be the wife of the member for carlingford
long long ago at the very beginning of her career when it was of mr cavendish that everybody was thinking the ideal fitness of this position had struck everybody
circumstances had changed since then and mr cavendish had fallen and a worthier hero had been placed in his stead but though the person was changed the circumstances remained unaltered
natural fitness was indeed so apparent that many people would have been disposed to say that it was lucilla's duty to accept mr ashburton even independent of the fact that he was perfectly eligible in every other respect
but with all this the new member for carlingford was not able to assure himself that there had been anything particular in lucilla's manner to himself
with her as with carlingford it was pure optimism
he was the best man and her quick intelligence had divined it sooner than anybody else had done
whether there was anything more in it mr ashburton could not tell
his own impression was that she would accept him but if she did not he would have no right to complain of encouragement or to think himself jilted
this was what he was thinking as he drove home but at the same time he was very far from being in a desponding state of mind
he felt very nearly as sure that lucilla would be his wife as if they were already standing before the rector in carlingford church
he had just won one victory which naturally made him feel more confident of winning another and even without entertaining any overexalted opinion of himself it was evident that under all the circumstances a woman of thirty with two hundred a year would be a fool to reject such an offer
and lucilla was the very furthest in the world from being a fool
it was in every respect the beginning of a new world to mr ashburton and it would have been out of nature had he not been a little excited
after the quiet life he had led at the firs biding his time he had now to look forward to a busy and important existence half of it spent amid the commotion and ceaseless stir of town
a new career a wife a new position the most important in his districtit was not much wonder if mr ashburton felt a little excited
he was fatigued at the same time too much fatigued to be disposed for sleep and all these united influences swayed him to a state of mind very much unlike his ordinary sensible calm
all his excitement culminated so in thoughts of lucilla that the new member felt himself truly a lover and late as the hour was he took up a candle and once more made a survey all alone of his solitary house
nothing could look more dismal than the dark rooms where there was neither light nor firethe great desert drawingroom for example which stood unchanged as it had been in the days of his grandaunts the good old ladies who had bequeathed the firs to mr ashburton
he had made no change in it and scarcely ever used it keeping to his library and diningroom with the possibility no doubt always before him of preparing it in due course of time for his wife
that moment had now arrived and in his excitement he went into the desolate room with his candle which just made the darkness visible and tried to see the dusky curtains and faded carpet and the indescribable fossil air which everything had
there were the odd little spiderlegged stands upon which the miss penrhyns had placed their workboxes and the old sofas on which they had sat and the floods of old tapestrywork with which they had decorated their favourite sittingroom
the sight of it chilled the member for carlingford and made him sad
he tried to turn his thoughts to the time when this same room should be fitted up to suit lucilla's complexion and should be gay with light and with her presence
he did all he could to realise the moment when with a mistress so active and energetic the whole place would change its aspect and glow forth resplendent into the twilight of the county a central point for all
perhaps it was his fatigue which gained upon him just at this moment and repulsed all livelier thoughts but the fact is that however willing lucilla might turn out to be her image was coy and would not come
the more mr ashburton tried to think of her as in possession here the more the grim images of the two old miss penrhyns walked out of the darkness and asserted their prior claims
they even seemed to have got into the library before him when he went back though there his fire was burning and his lamp
after that there was nothing left for a man to do even though he had been that day elected member for carlingford but to yield to the weakness of an ordinary mortal and go to bed
thoughts very different but even more disturbing were going on at the same time in grange lane
poor mr cavendish for one thingupbraided by everybody's looks and even by some people's wordsfeeling himself condemned censured and despised on all sidessmarting under his sister's wild reproaches and her husband's blunt commentary thereuponhad slunk away from their society after dinner not seeing now why he should bear it any longer
by jove
if it had only been for her sake you might have left over your philandering for another night mr woodburn had said in his coarse way and it was all mr cavendish could do to refrain from saying that one time and another he had done quite enough for her sake but he did not see any reason why he should put up with it any longer
he strolled out of doors though the town was still in commotion and could not but think of the sympathetic countenance which had paled today at sight of the numbers of the poll
she by heaven
might have had reason to find fault with him and she had never done so she had never perceived that he was stout or changed from old times
as he entertained these thoughts his steps going down grange lane gradually quickened but he did not say to himself where he was going
he went a very roundabout way as if he did not mean it as far as st roque's and then up by the lane to the faroff desert extremity of grove street
it was simply to walk off his excitement and disappointment and free himself from criticism for that evening at least but as he walked he could not help thinking that barbara if she were well dressed would still be a fine woman that her voice was magnificent in its way and that about naples perhaps or the baths of lucca or in germany or the south of france a man might be able to get on well enough with such a companion where society was not so exacting or stiffstarched as in england
and the end was that the feet of the defeated candidate carried him ere ever he was aware with some kind of independent volition of their own to mr lake's doorand it may be here said once for all that this visit was decisive of mr cavendish's fate
this will not be regarded as anything but a digression by such of lucilla's friends as may be solicitous to know what she was making up her mind to under the circumstances but the truth is that lucilla's historian cannot any more than miss marjoribanks herself could refrain from a certain regret over mr cavendish
that was what he came to poor man
after all his experiences a man who was capable of so much better thingsa man even who if he had made a right use of his opportunities might once have had as good a chance as any other of marrying lucilla herself
if there ever was an instance of chances thrown away and lost opportunities surely here was that lamentable example
and thus poor man
all his hopes and all his chances came to an end
as for miss marjoribanks herself it would be vain to say that this was not a very exciting moment for her
if there ever could be said to be a time when she temporarily lost the entire sway and control of herself and her feelings it would be at this crisis
she went about all that evening like a woman in a dream
for the first time in her life she not only did not know what she would do but she did not know what she wanted to do
there could now be no mistaking what mr ashburton's intentions were
up to a very recent time lucilla had been able to take refuge in her mourning and conclude that she had no present occasion to disturb herself
but now that calm was over
she could not conceal from herself that it was in her power by a word to reap all the advantages of the election and to step at once into the only position which she had ever felt might be superior to her own in carlingford
at last this great testimonial of female merit was to be laid at her feet
a man thoroughly eligible in every waymoderately rich well connected able to restore to her all and more than all the advantages which she had lost at her father's deatha man above all who was member for carlingford was going to offer himself to her acceptance and put his happiness in her hands and while she was so well aware of this she was not at all so well aware what answer she would make him
lucilla's mind was in such a commotion as she sat over her embroidery that she thought it strange indeed that it did not show and could not understand how aunt jemima could sit there so quietly opposite her as if nothing was the matter
but to tell the truth there was a good deal the matter with aunt jemima too which was perhaps the reason why she saw no signs of her companion's agitation
mrs john marjoribanks had not been able any more than her niece to shut her eyes to mr ashburton's evident meaning and now that matters were visibly coming to a crisis a sudden panic and horror had seized her
what would tom say
if she stood by and saw the prize snapped up under her very eyes what account could she give to her son of her stewardship
how could she explain her silence as to all his wishes and intentions her absolute avoidance of his name in all her conversations with lucilla
while miss marjoribanks marvelled that the emotion in her breast could be invisible and at aunt jemima's insensibility the bosom of that good woman was throbbing with equal excitement
sometimes each made an indifferent remark and panted after it as if she had given utterance to the most exhausting emotions but so great was the preoccupation of both that neither observed how it was faring with the other
but perhaps on the whole it was aunt jemima that suffered the most for her there was nothing flattering nothing gratifying no prospect of change or increased happiness or any of the splendours of imagination involved
all that could happen to her would be the displeasure of her son and his disappointment and it might be her fault she who could have consented to be chopped up in little pieces if that would have done tom any good but who notwithstanding was not anxious for him to marry his cousin now that her father's fortune was all lost and she had but two hundred a year
they had a silent cup of tea together at eight o'clock after that noisy exciting one at five which had been shared by half carlingford as aunt jemima thought
the buzz of that impromptu assembly in which everybody talked at the same moment and nobody listened except perhaps lucilla had all died away into utter stillness but the excitement had not died away that had only risen to a white heat silent and consuming as the two ladies sat over their tea
do you expect mr ashburton tomorrow lucilla
aunt jemima said after a long pause
mr ashburton
said lucilla with a slight start and to tell the truth she was glad to employ that childish expedient to gain a little time and consider what she should say
indeed i don't know if he will have time to come
most likely there will be a great deal to do
if he does come said mrs john with a sighor when he does come i ought to say for you know very well he will come lucillai suppose there is no doubt that he will have something very particular to say
i am sure i don't know aunt jemima said miss marjoribanks but she never raised her eyes from her work as she would have done in any other case
now that the election is over you know  i hope my dear i have been long enough in the world to know all about that aunt jemima said severely and what it means when young ladies take such interest in elections and then some such feeling as the dog had in the mangera jealousy of those who sought the gift though she herself did not want itcame over mrs john and at the same time a sudden desire to clear her conscience and make a stand for tom
she did it suddenly and went further than she meant to go but then she never dreamt it would have the least effect
i would not say anything to disturb your mind lucilla if you have made up your mind but when you receive your new friends you might think of other people who perhaps have been fond of you before you ever saw them or heard their very name
she was frightened at it herself before the words were out of her mouth and the effect it had upon miss marjoribanks was wonderful
she threw her embroidery away and looked tom's mother keenly in the face
i don't think you know anybody who is fond of me aunt jemima she said i don't suppose anybody is fond of me
do you
said lucilla
but by that time aunt jemima had got thoroughly frightened both at herself and her companion and had nothing more to say
i am sure all these people today have been too much for you she said
i wonder what they could all be thinking of for my part flocking in upon you like that so soon afteri thought it was very indelicate of lady richmond
and lucilla my dear your nerves are quite affected and i am sure you ought to go to bed
upon which miss marjoribanks recovered herself in a moment and folded up her worstedwork
i do feel tired she said sweetly and perhaps it was too much
i think i will take your advice aunt jemima
the excitement keeps one up for the moment and then it tells after
i suppose the best thing is to go to bed
much the best my dear aunt jemima said giving lucilla a kiss but she did not take her own advice
she took a long time to think it all over and sat up by the side of the decaying fire until it was midnightan hour at which a female establishment like this should surely have been all shut up and at rest
and lucilla did very much the same thing wondering greatly what her aunt could tell her if she had a mind and having the greatest inclination in the world to break into her chamber and see at any risk what was in tom's last letter
if she could have seen that it might have thrown some light on the problem lucilla was discussing or given her some guidance through her difficulties
it was just then that mr ashburton was inviting her image into the fossil drawingroom and finding nothing but the grim shades of the miss penrhyns answer to his call
perhaps this was because lucilla's image at that moment was called upon more potently from another quarter in a more familiar voice
but after this exhausting day and late sittingup everybody was late in the morning at least in grange lane
miss marjoribanks had slept little all night and she was not in a more settled state of mind when the day returned which probably would bring the matter to a speedy decision
her mind was like a country held by two armies one of which by turns swept the other into a corner but only to be driven back in its turn
after the unaccountable stupidity of the general publicafter all the cavendishes beverleys and riders who had once had it in their power to distinguish themselves by at least making her an offer and who had not done ithere at last in all good faith honesty and promptitude had appeared a man superior to them alla man whom she would have no reason to be ashamed of in any particular sensible like herself publicspirited like herselfa man whose pursuits she could enter into fully who had a perfectly ideal position to offer her and in whose person indeed all sorts of desirable qualities seemed to meet
miss marjoribanks when she considered all this and thought over all their recent intercourse and the terms of friendship into which the election had brought them felt as any other sensible person would have felt that there was only one answer which could be given to such a man
if she neglected or played with his devotion then certainly she never would deserve to have another such possibility afforded to her and merited nothing better than to live and die a single woman on two hundred a year
but then on the other hand there would rush forth a crowd of quickcoming and fantastic suggestions which took away lucilla's breath and made her heart beat loud
what if there might be other people who had been fond of her before she ever heard of mr ashburton's name
what if there might be some one in the world who was ready not to offer her his hand and fortune in a reasonable way as mr ashburton no doubt would but to throw himself all in a heap at her feet and make the greatest fool of himself possible for her sake
miss marjoribanks had been the very soul of good sense all her days but now her ruling quality seemed to forsake her
and yet she could not consent to yield herself up to pure unreason without a struggle
she fought manfully womanfully against the weakness which hitherto must have been lying hidden in some outoftheway corner in her heart
probably if mr ashburton had asked her all at once amid the excitement of the election or at any other unpremeditated moment lucilla would have been saved all this selftorment but it is hard upon a woman to have a proposal hanging over her head by a hair as it were and to look forward to it without any uncertainty or mystery and have full time to make up her mind
and there was no accounting for the curious force and vividness with which that strange idea about other people upon which aunt jemima would throw no light had come into lucilla's head
she was still in the same frightful chaos of uncertainty when mr ashburton was shown into the drawingroom
she had not even heard him ring and was thus deprived of the one possible moment of coming to a decision before she faced and confronted her fate
miss marjoribanks's heart gave a great jump and then she recovered herself and rose up without faltering and shook hands with him
she was all alone for aunt jemima had not found herself equal to facing the emergency and there was not the least possibility of evading or postponing or in any way running away from it now
lucilla sat down again upon her sofa where she had been sitting and composed herself with a certain despairing tranquillity and trusted in providence
she had thrown herself on other occasions though never at an equally important crisis upon the inspiration of the moment and she felt it would not forsake her now
i should be sorry the election was over said mr ashburton who was naturally a little agitated too if i thought its privileges were over and you would not let me comei shall always think i owe my success to you and i would thank you for being so kindso very kind to me if  oh dear no pray don't say so cried lucilla
i only felt sure that you were the best manthe only manfor carlingford
i wish i might but prove the best man for something else said the candidate nervously and then he cleared his throat
i would say you had been kind if i did not hopeif i was not so very anxious that you should be something more than kind
it may be vain of me but i think we could get on together
i think i could understand you and do you justicelucilla
what is the matter
good heavens
is it possible that i have taken you quite by surprise
what caused this question was that miss marjoribanks had all at once changed colour and given a great start and put her hand to her breast where her heart had taken such a leap that she felt it in her throat
but it was not because of what mr ashburton was saying it was because of one of the very commonest sounds of everyday existencea cab driving down grange lane but then it was a cab driving in such a way that you could have sworn there was somebody in it in a terrible hurry and who had just arrived by the twelve o'clock train
oh no no said miss marjoribanks i know you have always done me more than justice mr ashburton and so have all my friends and i am sure we always will get on well together
i wish you joy with all my heart and i wish you every happiness and i always thought up to this very last moment  lucilla stopped again and once more put her hand to her breast
her heart gave another jump and if such a thing were possible to a heart went off from its mistress altogether and rushed downstairs bodily to see who was coming
yet with all her agitation she had still enough selfcontrol to lift an appealing looka look which threw herself upon his mercy and implored his forbearanceto mr ashburton's face
as for the member for carlingford he was confounded and could not tell what to make of it
what was it she had thought up to the very last moment
was this a refusal or was she only putting off his claim or was it something altogether independent of him and his intentions that agitated lucilla to such an unusual extent
while he sat in his confusion trying to make it out the most startling sound interrupted the interview
the old disused bell that had so often called dr marjoribanks up at night and which hung near the door of the old doctor's room just over the drawingroom began to peal through the silence as if rung by a hand too impatient to notice what it was with which it made its summons
papa's bell
miss marjoribanks cried with a little shriek and she got up trembling and then dropped upon her seat again and in her agitated state burst into tears
and mr ashburton felt that under these most extraordinary circumstances even so sensible a woman as lucilla might be justified in fainting embarrassing and uncomfortable as that would be
i will go and see what it means he said with still half the air of a man who had a right to go and see and was as it were almost in his own house
as he turned round the door bell pealed wildly below in correction of the mistake
it was evident that somebody wanted admission who had not a moment to lose and who was in the habit of pulling wildly at whatever came in his way
mr ashburton went out of the room to see who it was a little amused and a little alarmed but much annoyed at bottom as was only natural at such an interruption
he did not very well know whether he was accepted or rejected but it was equally his duty in either case to put a stop to the ringing of that ghostly bell
he went away meaning to return immediately and have it out and know his fate
and lucilla whose heart had come back having fully ascertained who it was and was now choking her with its beating was left to await the new event and the newcomer alone
chapter l   mr ashburton went away from lucilla's side thinking to come back again and clear everything up but he did not come back
though he heard nothing and saw nothing that could throw any distinct light on the state of her mind yet instinct came to his aid it is to be supposed in the matter
he did not return and lucilla sat on her sofa with her hands clasped together to support her and her heart leaping in her very mouth
she was in a perfect frenzy of suspense listening with her whole heart and soul but that did not prevent the same crowd of thoughts which had been persecuting her for twentyfour hours from keeping up their wild career as before
what reason had she to suppose that any one had arrived
who could arrive in that accidental way without a word of warning
and what possible excuse had she to offer to herself for sending the new member for carlingforda man so excellent and honourable and eligibleaway
the minutes or rather the seconds passed over miss marjoribanks like hours as she sat thus waiting not daring to stir lest the slightest movement might keep from her ears some sound from below till at last the interval seemed so long that her heart began to sink and her excitement to fail
it could not be any oneif it had been any one something more must have come of it before now
it must have been lydia richmond coming to see her sister next door or somebody connected with the election or  when she got as far as this lucilla's heart suddenly mounted up again with a spring into her ears
she heard neither words nor voice but she heard something which had as great an effect upon her as either could have had
on the landing halfway up the stairs there had stood in dr marjoribanks's house from time immemorial a little oldfashioned table with a large china bowl upon it in which the cards of visitors were placed
it was a great bowl and it was always full and anybody rushing upstairs in a reckless way might easily upset table and cards and all in their progress
this was what happened while lucilla sat listening
there was a rumble a crash and a sound as of falling leaves and it made her heart as we have said jump into her ears
it is the table and all the cards said lucillaand in that moment her composure came back to her as by a miracle
she unclasped her hands which she had been holding pressed painfully together by way of supporting herself and she gave a long sigh of unutterable relief and her whirl of thought stopped and cleared up with an instantaneous rapidity
everything seemed to be explained by that sound and there never was a greater change upon the looks and feelings of any one in this world than that which passed upon the looks and feelings of lucilla in the interval between the drawing up of that cab and the rush of tom marjoribanks at the drawingroom door
for after the commotion on the staircase lucilla had no further doubt on the subject
she even had the strength to get up to meet him and hold out her hands to him by way of welcomebut found herself before she knew how in the arms of a man with a beard who was so much changed in his own person that he ventured to kiss her which was a thing tom marjoribanks though her cousin had never dared to do before
he kissed hersuch was his audacity and then he held her at arm's length to have a good look at her and then according to all appearance would have repeated his first salutation but that lucilla had come to herself and took the reins at once into her hand
tom
she said of course it is you nobody else would have been so impertinent
when did you come
where did you come from
who could ever have thought of your appearing like this in such an altogether unexpected
unexpected
said tom with an astonished air
but i suppose you had other things to think of
ah lucilla i could not write to you
i felt i ought to be beside you trying if there was not something i could do
my mother told you of course but i could not trust myself to write to you
then lucilla saw it all and that aunt jemima had meant to do mr ashburton a good turn
and she was not grateful to her aunt however kind her intentions might have been
but tom was holding her hand and looking into her face while this thought passed through her mind and miss marjoribanks was not the woman under any circumstances to make dispeace
i am sure i am very glad said lucilla
i would say you were changed but only of course that would make you think how i am changed and though one knows one has gone off  i never saw you look so nice all your life cried tom energetically and he took hold of both her hands and looked into her face more and more
to be sure he had a kind of right being a cousin and newly returned after so long an absence but it was embarrassing all the same
oh tom don't say so cried lucilla if you but knew how different the house is and everything so alteredand dear papa
it was natural and indeed it was only proper that miss marjoribanks should crywhich she did abundantly partly for grief and partly because of the flutter of agitation and something like joy in which she was and which considering that she had always frankly owned that she was fond of tom was quite natural too
she cried with honest abandonment and did not take much notice what her cousin was doing to comfort her though indeed he applied himself to that benevolent office in the most anxious way
don't cry lucilla he said i can't bear it
it don't look natural to see you cry
my poor uncle was an old man and you were always the best daughter in the world  oh tom
sometimes i don't think so sobbed lucilla sometimes i think if i had sat up that last nightand you don't know how good he was
it was me he was thinking of and never himself
when he heard the money was lost all that he said was poor lucilla
you rang his bell though it is the nightbell and nobody ever touches it now i knew it could be nobody but you and to see you again brings up everything so distinctly
oh tom
he was always very fond of you
lucilla said tom marjoribanks you know i always had a great regard for my uncle
but it was not for him i came back
he was never half so fond of me as i am of you
you know that as well as i do
there never was a time that i would not have gone to the other end of the world if you had told me and i have done it as near as possible
i went to india because you sent me away
and i have come back  you have not come back only for an hour i hope
said miss marjoribanks with momentary impatience you are not obliged to talk of everything all in a momentand when one has not even got over one's surprise at seeing you
when did you come back
when did you have anything to eat
you want your breakfast or your lunch or something and tom
the idea of sitting here talking to me and talking nonsense when you have not seen your mother
she is in her own room you unnatural boythe blue room next to what used to be yours
to think aunt jemima should be in the house and you should sit here talking nonsense to me
this minute said tom apologetically but he drew his chair in front of miss marjoribanks so that she could not get away
i have come back to stay as long as you will let me he said don't go away yet
look here lucillaif you had married i would have tried to bear it but as long as you are not married i can't help feeling as if there might be a chance for me yet
and that is why i have come home
i met somebody coming downstairs
tom said miss marjoribanks it is dreadful to see that you have come back just as tiresome as ever
i always said i would not marry for ten years
if you mean to think i have never had any opportunities  lucilla said tom and there was decision in his eye somebody came downstairs as i came in
i want to know whether it is to be him or me
himor you
said lucilla in dismay
blunderer as he was he had gone direct to the very heart of the question and it was impossible not to tremble a little in the presence of such straightforward clearsightedness
miss marjoribanks had risen up to make her escape as soon as it should be possible but she was so much struck by tom's unlookedfor perspicuity that she sat down again in her consternation
i think you are going out of your mind she said
what do you know about the gentleman who went downstairs
i am not such a wonderful beauty nor such a witch that everybody who sees me should want toto marry me
don't talk any more nonsense but let me go and get you something to eat
they would if they were of my way of thinking said the persistent tom
lucilla you shan't go
this is what i have come home for
you may as well know at once and then there can be no mistake about it
my poor uncle is gone and you can't be left by yourself in the world
will you have him or me
i am not going to be tyrannised over like this said lucilla with indignation again rising though he still held her hands
you talk as if you had just come for a call and had everything to say in a moment
when a man comes off a long journey it is his breakfast he wants and not anot anything else that i know of
go up to your mother and let me go
will you have him or me
repeated tom
it was not wisdom is was instinct that made him thus hold fast by his text and as for lucilla nothing but the softened state in which she was nothing but the fact that it was tom marjoribanks who had been ten years away and was always ridiculous could have kept her from putting down at once such an attempt to coerce her
but the truth was that miss marjoribanks did not feel her own mistress at that moment and perhaps that was why he had the audacity to repeat will you have him or me
then lucilla found herself fairly driven to bay
tom
she said with a solemnity that overwhelmed him for the moment for he thought at first with natural panic that it was himself who was being rejected i would not have him if he were to go down on his knees
i know he is very nice and very agreeable and the best manand i am sure i ought to do it said miss marjoribanks with a mournful sense of her own weakness and everybody will expect it of me but i am not going to have him and i never meant it whatever you or anybody may say
when lucilla had made this decisive utterance she turned away with a certain melancholy majesty to go and see after lunchfor he had loosed her hand and fallen back in consternation thinking for the moment that it was all over
miss marjoribanks sighed and turned round not thinking of tom who was safe enough but with a natural regret for the member for carlingford who now poor man was as much out of the question as if he had been dead and buried
but before she reached the door tom had recovered himself
he went up to her in his ridiculous way without the slightest regard either for the repast she was so anxious to prepare for him or for his mother's feelings or indeed for anything else in the world except the one thing which had brought him as he said home
then lucilla after all it is to be me he said taking her to him and arresting her progress as if she had been a baby and though he had such a beard and was twice as big and strong as he used to be there were big tears in the great fellow's eyes
it is to be me after all said tom looking at her in a way that startled lucilla
say it is to be me
miss marjoribanks had come through many a social crisis with dignity and composure
she had never yet been known to fail in an emergency
she had managed mr cavendish and up to the last moment mr ashburton and all the intervening candidates for her favour with perfect selfcontrol and command of the situation
perhaps it was because as she had herself said her feelings had never been engaged
but now when it was only tomhe whom once upon a time she had dismissed with affectionate composure and given such excellent advice to and regarded in so motherly a wayall lucilla's powers seemed to fail her
it is hard to have to wind up with such a confession after having so long entertained a confidence in lucilla which nothing seemed likely to impair
she broke down just at the moment when she had most need to have all her wits about her
perhaps it was her past agitation which had been too much for her
perhaps it was the tears in tom marjoribanks's eyes
but the fact was that lucilla relinquished her superior position for the time being and suffered him to make any assertion he pleased and was so weak as to cry for the second time toowhich of all things in the world was surely the last thing to have been expected of miss marjoribanks at the moment which decided her fate
lucilla cried and acquiesced and thought of her father and of the member for carlingford and gave to each a tear and a regret and she did not even take the trouble to answer any question or to think who it was she was leaning on
it was to be tom after allafter all the archdeacons doctors generals members of parliamentafter the ten years and more in which she had not gone offafter the poor old doctor's grudge against the nephew whom he did not wish to inherit his wealth and aunt jemima's quiet wiles and attempt to disappoint her boy
fate and honest love had been waiting all the time till their moment came and now it was not even necessary to say anything about it
the fact was so clear that it did not require stating
it was to be tom after all
to do him justice tom behaved at this moment in which affairs were left in his hands as if he had been training for it all his life
perhaps it was the first time in which he had done anything absolutely without a blunder
he had wasted no time and no words and left no room for consideration or for that natural relenting towards his rival which was inevitable as soon as mr ashburton was off the field
he had insisted and he had perceived that there was but one alternative for lucilla
now that all was over he took her back to her seat and comforted her and made no offensive demonstrations of triumph
it is to be me after all
he repeated and it was utterly impossible to add anything to the eloquent brevity of this succinct statement of the case
tom said miss marjoribanks when she had a little recovered if it is to be you that is no reason why you should be so unnatural
go up directly and see your mother
what will aunt jemima think of me if she knows i have let you stay talking nonsense here
yes lucillathis moment said tom but all the same he showed not the slightest inclination to go away
he did not quite believe in it as yet and could not help feeling as if should he venture to leave her the whole fabric of his incredible good fortune must dissolve and melt away
as for lucilla her selfpossession gradually came back to her when the crisis was over and she felt that her involuntary abdication had lasted long enough and that it was full time to take the management of affairs back into her own hands
you shall go now she said drying her eyes or else you cannot stay here
i thought of letting you stay in the house as aunt jemima is with me but if you do not mean to go and tell your mother i will tell nancy to send your things up to the blue boar
ring the bell please if you will not ring the bell i will do it myself tom
you may say what you like but i know you are famishing and aunt jemima is in the blue room next door tooh here is nancy
it is mr tom who has come home said lucilla hastily not without a rising colour for it was hard to explain why when his mother was in the blue room all this time he should have stayed here
yes miss lucillaso i heard said nancy dropping a doubtful curtsey
and then only tom was persuaded and bethought himself of his natural duty and rushed upstairs
he seized nancy's hand and shook it violently as he passed her to her great consternation
the moment of his supremacy was over
it was to be tom after all but lucilla had recovered her selfpossession and taken the helm in her hand again and tom was master of the situation no more
yes it is mr tom said lucilla shaking her head with something between a smile and a sigh
it could be nobody but him that would ring that bell and upset all the cards
i hope he has not broken dear papa's punchbowl that he used to be so fond of
he must have something to eat nancy though he is such an awkward boy
i don't see nothing like a boy in him said nancy he's big and stout and one o' them awful beards
there's been a deal of changes since he went away but if he's new comed off that terrible long journey it is but natural as you say miss lucilla that he should want something to eat
and then miss marjoribanks made various suggestions which were received still doubtfully by her prime minister
nancy to tell the truth did not like the turn things were taking
lucilla's maiden household had been on the whole getting along very comfortably and there was no telling how long it might have lasted without any new revolution
to be sure mr ashburton had looked dangerous but nancy had seen a great many dangers of that kind blow over and was not easily alarmed
mr tom however was a very different person and nancy was sufficiently penetrating to see that something had happened
therefore she received very coldly lucilla's suggestions about lunch
it ain't like the old times she said at last when there was always something as one could put to the fire in a hurry and nancy stood turning round the handle of the door in her hand and contemplating the changed state of affairs with a sigh
that would be all very true if you were like anybody else said lucilla but i hope you would not like to send mr tom off to the blue boar
after all perhaps it is better to have aa gentleman in the house
i know you always used to think so
they are a great deal of trouble butfor some things you know said lucilla and then mr tom is not just like other people and whatever happens nancy you are an old dear and it shall never make any difference between you and me
when she had said these words lucilla gave her faithful servant a hug and sent her off to look after tom marjoribanks's meal and then she herself went halfway downstairs and picked up the cards that were still scattered about the landing and found with satisfaction that the doctor's old punchbowl was not broken
all tom's things were lying below in the hallheaps of queer indianlooking baggagetossed down anyhow in a corner as if the owner had been in much too great a hurry to think of any secondary circumstances
and it was there he met poor mr ashburton said lucilla to herself with a certain pathos
there it was indeed that the encounter had taken place
they had seen each other but for a moment but that moment had been enough to send the member for carlingford away dejected and to impress upon tom's mind the alternative that it was either to be him or me
miss marjoribanks contemplated the spot with a certain tender sentimental interest as any gentle moralist might look at a field of battle
what feelings must have been in the minds of the two as they met and looked at each other
what a dread sense of disappointment on the one side what sharp stimulation on the other
thus lucilla stood and looked down from her own landing upon the scene of that encounter full of pensive interest
and now it was all over and mr ashburton had passed away as completely as mr chiltern who was in his grave poor man or mr cavendish who was going to marry barbara lake
the thought of so sudden a revolution made lucilla giddy as she went thoughtfully upstairs
poor mr ashburton
it hardly seemed real even to miss marjoribanks when she sat down again in the drawingroom and confessed to herself that after all it was to be tom
but when he came downstairs again with his mother lucilla was quite herself and had got over all her weakness
aunt jemima for her part was in a very agitated state of mind
tom had come too soon or mr ashburton too late and all the fruits of her little bit of treachery were accordingly lost and at the same time the treachery itself remained revealed at least to one person in the very clearest light
it did not seem possible to aunt jemima that lucilla would not tell
if she had not done it now in the excitement of the moment at least it would come out some time when she was least expecting it and her son's esteem and confidence would be lost
therefore it was with a very blank countenance that mrs john marjoribanks came downstairs
she dared not say a word and she had to kiss her niece and take her to her maternal bosom tom looking on all the while but she gave lucilla a look that was pitiful to see
and when tom finally was dismissed to his room to open his trunks and show the things he had brought home aunt jemima drew near her future daughter with wistful guiltiness
there was no comfort to her in the thought of the india shawl which her son had gone to find
any day any hour lucilla might tell and if the unlucky mother were put on her defence what could she say
lucilla said the guilty woman under her breath i am sure you think it very strange
i don't attempt to deceive you
i can't tell you how thankful and glad i am that it has all ended so well but you know lucilla in the first place i did not know what your feelings were and i thought perhaps that if anything would tell it would be a surprise and then  did you aunt jemima
said miss marjoribanks with gentle wonder
i thought you had been thinking of mr ashburton for my part
and so i was lucilla said the poor lady with great relief and eagerness
i thought he was coming forward and of course he would have been a far better match than my tom
i had to think for you both my dear
and then i never knew what your feelings were nor if you would care and then it was not as if there had been a day fixed  dear aunt jemima said miss marjoribanks if you are pleased now what does it matter
but i do hope you are pleased now
and mrs john took her niece into her arms again this time with better will and cried
i am as happy as ever i can be said the inconsistent mother
i always knew you were fond of each other lucilla before you knew it yourselves i saw what would come of it
but my poor brotherinlawand you will make my boy happy and never turn him against his mother cried the repentant sinner
lucilla was not the woman to resist such an appeal
mrs john had meant truly enough towards her in other ways if not in this way and miss marjoribanks was fond of her aunt and it ended in a kiss of peace freely bestowed and a vow of protection and guidance from the strong to the weak though the last was only uttered in the protectress's liberal heart
chapter li   when miss marjoribanks had time to consider the prospect which had thus so suddenly opened before her it also had its difficulties like everything else in the world
her marriage now could not be the straightforward business it might have been had it been mr ashburton instead of tom
in that case she would have gone to an established house and lifeto take her place in the one and her share in the other and to find the greater part of her surroundings and duties already fixed for her which was a thing that would have very greatly simplified the matter
but tom who had dashed home from india at full speed as soon as he heard of his uncle's death had left his profession behind him at calcutta and had nothing to do in england and was probably too old to resume his non practice at the bar even if he had been in the least disposed to do so while at the same time an idle mana man to be found everlastingly at homewould have been insupportable to lucilla
miss marjoribanks might feel disposed for everybody's good to assume the sovereign authority in her own house but to marry anybody that would be merely an appendage to her was a thing not to be thought of and as soon as the first preliminaries were arranged her active mind sprang up with redoubled vigour from the maze in which it had been
her intelligence had suspended so to speak all its ordinary operations for twentyfour hours at least while it was busy investigating the purely personal question from the moment when the member for carlingford was finally elected until tom marjoribanks rang the nightbell at the old doctor's door lucilla's thoughts had been in that state of overstimulation and absorption which is almost as bad as having no power of thought at all
but as soon as the pressure was removedas soon as it was all over and the decision made and no further question was possiblethen miss marjoribanks's active mind sprang up with renewed energy
for it was not only a new beginning but everything had to be settled and arranged
her mind was full of it while her hands were busy putting away all the indian presents which tom had broughtpresents which were chronological in their character and which he had begun to accumulate from the very beginning of his exile
it could not but be touching to lucilla to see how he had thought of her for all these years but her mind being as everybody is aware of a nobly practical kind her thoughts instead of dallying with these tokens of the past went forward with serious solicitude into the future
the marriage could not take place until the year was out and there was accordingly time to arrange everything and to settle all the necessary preliminaries to a point as near perfection as is possible to merely human details
tom no doubt was very urgent and pressing and would have precipitated everything and had the whole business concluded tomorrow if he could have had his way
but the fact was that having once given in to him in the memorable way which we have already recorded lucilla did not now so far as the final arrangements were concerned make much account of tom's wishes
heaven be praised there was one of the two who knew what was right and proper and was not to be moved from the correct path by any absurd representations
miss marjoribanks was revolving all these important questions when she laid her hand by chance as people say upon the carlingford gazette all damp and inky which had just been laid upon the library table
it contained of course all the news of the election but lucilla was too well acquainted with that beforehand to think of condescending to derive her information from a newspaper
she looked at the advertisements with an eye which saw all that was there without pausing upon anything in particular
she saw the usual notice about marmalade oranges and the announcement that young mr vincent who after that made himself so well known in carlingford was to preach the next sunday in salem chapel and all the other important novelties in the place but naturally she took but a moderate amount of interest in such details as these
suddenly however lucilla's eye which if it could ever be said to be vacant had been regarding vacantly the list of advertisements kindled up and all its usual energy and intelligence came back to it
her thoughtful face woke up as from a dream
her head which had been drooping in pensive meditation grew erecther whole figure expanded
she clasped her hands together as if in the fervour of the moment nobody else being present she could not refrain from shaking hands with herself and giving vent to a selfcongratulation
it is a special providence said lucilla to herself with her usual piety and then she folded up the paper in a little square with the announcement in the middle which had struck her so much and placed it where tom could not fail to see it when he came in and went upstairs with a new and definite direction given to her thoughts
that was how it must be
lucilla for her part felt no difficulty in discerning the leadings of providence and she could not but appreciate the readiness with which her desires were attended to and the prompt clearingup of her difficulties
there are people whose inclinations providence does not seem to superintend with such painstaking watchfulness but then no doubt that must be their own fault
and when tom came in they had what aunt jemima called one of their discussions about their future life although the only thing in it worthy consideration so far as tom was concerned seemed to be the time when they should be married which occupied at present all that hero's faculties
everything else will arrange itself after you know he said with calm confidence
time enough for all the rest
the thing is lucilla to decide when you will leave off those formalities and let it be
why shouldn't it be now
do you think my uncle would wish to keep us unhappy all for an idea
my dear tom i am not in the least unhappy said lucilla interrupting him sweetly nor you either unless you tell dreadful stories and as for poor dear papa miss marjoribanks added with a sigh if we were to do exactly as he wished i don't think it would ever be
if you were not so foolish you would not oblige me to say such things
tom let us leave off talking nonsensethe thing that we both want is something to do
that is what i want said tom quickly but as for you lucilla you shall do nothing but enjoy yourself and take care of yourself
the idea of you wanting something to do
miss marjoribanks regarded her betrothed with mild and affectionate contempt as he thus delivered himself of his foolish sentiments
it is of no use trying to make him understand she said with an air of resignation
do you know that i have always been doing something and responsible for something all my life
yes my poor darling said tom i know but now you are in my hands i mean to take care of you lucilla you shall have no more anxiety or trouble
what is the good of a man if he can't save the woman he is fond of from all that
cried the honest fellowand lucilla could not but cast a despairing glance round her as if appealing to heaven and earth
what was to be done with a man who had so little understanding of her and of himself and of the eternal fitness of things
my dear tom she said once more mildly we may have lost some money but we are very well off and providence has been very kind to us
and there are a great many poor people in the world who are not so well off
i have always tried to be of some use to my fellowcreatures said lucilla and i don't mean whatever you may say to give it up now
my dearest lucilla if it was the poor you were thinking of
i might have known it was something different from my stupid notions cried tom
this kind of adoration was new to lucilla notwithstanding her many experiences
and he thought it so good of her to condescend to be good that she could not help thinking a little better of herself than ordinary though that perhaps was not absolutely needful and then she proceeded with the elucidation of her views
i have been of some use to my fellowcreatures in my way said miss marjoribanks modestly but it has been hard work and people are not always grateful you know
and then things are a good deal changed in carlingford
a woman may devote herself to putting some life into society and give up years of her time andand even her opportunities and all that and do a great deal of good but yet if she is put aside for a moment there is an end of it
i have been doing the best i could for carlingford for ten years said lucilla with a little natural sadness and if any one were to examine into it where is it all now
they have only got into the way of looking to me and i do believe if you were to go up and down from elsworthy's to st roque's though you might find people at dinner here and there you would not find a shadow of what could really be called society in all grange lane
lucilla paused for naturally her feelings were moved and while tom bent over her with tender and respectful devotion it was not to be wondered at if miss marjoribanks in the emotion of her heart should wipe away a tear
after working at it for ten years
said lucilla and now since poor papa died who was always full of discriminationthis is what will come of it tom she added solemnlythey will go back to their old ridiculous parties as if they had never seen anything better and they will all break up into little cliques and make their awful morning calls and freeze one another to death
that will be the end of it all after one has slaved like alike a woman in a mill said the disappointed reformer and given up ten years
my poor darling
cried tom who would have liked to go and challenge carlingford for being so insensible to his lucilla's devotion and cherishing maternal care
but if it had been the poor said miss marjoribanks recovering her spirits a little they could not help being the better for what one did for them
they might continue to be as stupid as ever and ungrateful and all that but if they were warm and comfortable instead of cold and hungry it would always make a difference
tom i will tell you what you will do if you want to please me
you will take all our money and realise it you know whatever that means and go off directly as fast as the train can carry you and buy an estate
an estate
cried tom in consternation and the magnitude of the word was such and lucilla was so entirely in earnest that he jumped from his chair and gazed at her as if constrained notwithstanding his amazement to rush off instantly and obey
i did not mean just this moment said lucilla sit down and we can talk it all over tom
you know it would be something for you to do you cannot just go living on like this at your age you could improve the land you know and do all that sort of thing and the people you could leave to me
but lucilla said tom recovering a little from his consternation it is not so easy buying an estate
i mean all that i have to be settled upon you in case of anything happening
land may be a safe enough investment but you know very often lucillathe fact is it doesn't pay
we could make it pay said miss marjoribanks with a benevolent smile and besides there are estates and estates
i don't want you to go and throw away your money
it was in the carlingford gazette this morning and i can't help feeling it was a special providence
of course you never looked at it in the paper though i marked it for you
tom it is marchbank that i want you to buy
you know how papa used to talk of it
he used to say it was just a nice little property that a gentleman could manage
if he had been spared said lucilla putting her handkerchief to her eyes and these wicked dreadful people had not failed nor nothing happened i know he would have bought it himself
dear papa
and he would have given it to me and most likely so far as one can tell it would have come to you at the last and you would have been marjoribanks of marchbank like our greatgreatgrandpapa and that is what i want you to do
lucilla's proposition as it thus unfolded itself took away tom marjoribanks's breath for notwithstanding that it came from a young lady and was confused by some slightly unintelligible conditions about doing good to one's fellowcreatures it was not a trifling or romantic suggestion
tom too could remember marchbank and his uncle's interest in it and the careful way in which he explained to the ignorant that this was the correct pronunciation of his own name
while lucilla made her concluding address tom seemed to see himself a little fellow with his eyes and his ears very wide open trotting about with small steps after the doctor as he went over the redbrick house and neglected gardens at marchbank it was only to be let then and had passed through many hands and was in miserable case both lands and house
but neither the lands nor the house were bad of themselves and tom was like lucilla perfectly well aware that something might be made of them
this idea gave a new direction to his thoughts
though he had been brought up to the bar he had never been a lover of town and was in reality like so many young englishmen better qualified to be something in the shape of a country gentleman than for any other profession in the world and he had left his profession behind and was in most urgent want of something to do
he did not give in at once with a lover's abject submission but thought it over for twentyfour hours at all his spare momentswhen he was smoking his evening cigar in the garden and studying the light in his lady's window and when he ought to have been asleep and again in the morning when he sallied forth before miss marjoribanks's blinds were drawn up or the house had fairly awoke
he was not a man of brilliant ability but he had that sure and steady eye for the real secret of a position which must have been revealed to every competent critic by the wonderful clearsightedness with which he saw and the wise persistence with which he held to the necessity of an immediate choice between himself and mr ashburton
he had seen that there was but one alternative and he had suffered no delay nor divergence from the question in hand
and it was this same quality which had helped him to the very pretty addition to his small patrimony which he had meant to settle on lucilla and which would now make the acquisition of marchbank an easy thing enough
and though tom had looked wise on the subject of investment in land it was a kind of investment in every way agreeable to him
thus lucilla's arrow went straight to the markstraighter even than she had expected for besides all the other and more substantial considerations there was to tom's mind a sweet sense of poetic justice in the thought that after his poor uncle's failure who had never thought him good enough for lucilla it should be he and no other who would give this coveted possession to his cousin
had marchbank been in the market in dr marjoribanks's time it was as lucilla herself said his money that would have bought it but in such a case so far as the doctor was concerned there would have been little chance for tom
now all that was changed and it was in tom's hands that the wealth of the family lay
it was he who was the head and could alone carry out what lucilla's more original genius suggested
if the doctor could but have seen it he who had formed plans so very differentbut perhaps by that time dr marjoribanks had found out that providence after all had not been so illadvised as he once thought in committing to his care such a creative intelligence as that of lucilla and withholding from him the boy
as for miss marjoribanks after she had made up her mind and stated her conviction she gave herself no further trouble on the subject but took it for granted with that true wisdom which is unfortunately so rare among women
she did not talk about it overmuch or display any feverish anxiety about marchbank but left her suggestion to work and had faith in tom
at the same time the tranquillising sense of now knowing to a certain extent what lay before her came into lucilla's mind
it would be a new sphere but a sphere in which she would find herself at home
still near enough to carlingford to keep a watchful eye upon society and give it the benefit of her experience and yet at the same time translated into a new world where her influence might be of untold advantage as lucilla modestly said to her fellowcreatures
there was a village not far from the gates at marchbank where every kind of village nuisance was to be found
there are people who are very tragical about village nuisances and there are other people who assail them with loathing as a duty forced upon their consciences but lucilla was neither of the one way of thinking nor of the other
it gave her the liveliest satisfaction to think of all the disorder and disarray of the marchbank village
her fingers itched to be at itto set all the crooked things straight and clean away the rubbish and set everything as she said on a sound foundation
if it had been a model village with prize flowergardens and clean as arcadia the thought of it would not have given miss marjoribanks half so much pleasure
the recollection of all the wretched hovels and miserable cottages exhilarated her heart
they may be as stupid and ungrateful as they like she said to herself but to be warm and comfortable instead of cold and hungry always makes a difference
perhaps it was not the highest motive possible and it might be more satisfactory to some people to think of lucilla as actuated by lofty sentiments of philanthropy but to persons acquainted with miss marjoribanks's character her biographer would scorn to make any pretence
what would be the good of a spirit full of boundless activity and benevolent impulses if there was nobody to helpwhat would be the use of selfdevotion if the race in general stood in no need of charitable ministrations
lucilla had been of use to her fellowcreatures all her life and though she was about to relinquish one branch of usefulness that was not to say that she should be prevented from entering into another
the state of the marchbank village did her good to the very bottom of her soul
it justified her to herself for her choice of tom which but for this chance of doing good might perhaps have had the air of a merely selfish personal preference
now she could regard it in a loftier light and the thought was sweet to lucilla for such a beautiful way of helping her neighbour would no doubt have been to a certain extent impracticable amid the many occupations of the member's wife
perhaps the most difficult thing in miss marjoribanks's way at this otherwise satisfactory moment was the difficulty she found in persuading society first of the reality and then of the justice of the step she had taken
most of them to tell the truth had forgotten all about tom marjoribanks
it is true that when lucilla's intentions and prospects were discussed in grange lane as they had been so often it was not uncommon for people to say there was once a cousin you know but nobody had ever given very much heed to the suggestion
when lucilla went to tell mrs chiley of what had happened she was but inadequately prepared for the surprise with which her intelligence was received
for it all seemed natural enough to miss marjoribanks
she had gone on very steadily for a long time without thinking particularly about anybody and disposed to accept the most eligible and satisfactory person who happened to present himself but all the time there had been a warm corner in her heart for tom
and then the eligible person had not come and she had been worried and wearied and had had her losses like most other people
and it had always been pleasant to remember that there was one man in the world who if she but held out a finger to himbut then the people in grange lane were not capable of discrimination on such a delicate subject and had never as was to be expected had the smallest insight into lucilla's heart
you have something to tell me lucilla
said old mrs chiley
you need not say no for i can see it in your eyes
and how lucky it is the colonel is out and we can have it all to ourselves
come here and sit by me and tell me allevery word
dear mrs chiley said lucilla you can always see what one means before one says a word
and it has all happened so suddenly but the very first thing i thought of doing was to come and tell you
mrs chiley gave her young friend who was leaning over her a hug which was the only answer which could be made to so touching a speech and drew lucilla down upon a low chair that had been placed by the side of her sofa
she kept miss marjoribanks's hand in her own and caressed it and looked at her with satisfaction in every line of her face
after waiting so long and having so many disappointments everything was going to turn out so entirely as it ought to do at last
i think i know what you are going to tell me my dear said mrs chiley and i am so pleased lucilla
i only wonder you did not give me a hint from the very first
you remember i asked you when you came here that snowy evening
i was a hardhearted old woman and i dare say you were very vexed but i am so glad to think that the colonel never stood out against him but gave his consent that very day
this was the moment if there ever was such a moment when lucilla lost courage
mrs chiley was so entirely confident as to what was coming and it was something so different that was really coming and it was hard upon miss marjoribanks to feel that she was about to disappoint everybody's expectations
she had to clear her throat before she spokeshe who was generally so ready for every emergency and she could not help feeling for the moment as if she was a young girl who had run away with somebody and deceived all her anxious friends
dear mrs chiley i am afraid i am not going to say what you expected said lucilla
i am very comfortable and happy and i think it's for the best and i am so anxious that you should like him but it is not the person you are thinking of
it is  here the old lady to lucilla's surprise rose up upon her pillows and threw her arms round her and kissed her over again and fell acrying
i always said how generous you were lucilla cried mrs chiley
i knew it from the first
i was always fond of him you know and now that he has been beaten poor dear and disappointed you've gone and made it up to him
lucilla other people may say what they like but it is just what i always expected of you
this unlookedfor burst of enthusiasm took lucilla entirely by surprise
she could not say in reply that mr cavendish did not want her to make it up to him but the fact that this was the only alternative which occurred to mrs chiley filled miss marjoribanks with a sense of something like positive guilt
she had deceived everybody and raised false expectations and how was she to explain herself
it was with humility and embarrassment that she spoke
i don't know what you will say when you hear who it really is she said
he has been fond of me all this time though he has been so far away
he went to india because i sent him and he came back as soon as ever he heard aboutwhat had happened
and what could i do
i could not be so ungrateful or so hardhearted again as to send him away
lucilla who is it
said mrs chiley growing palefor she generally had a little wintry bloom on her cheek like the china roses she was so fond of
don't keep me like this in suspense
dear mrs chiley said lucilla with the brevity of excitement i don't see what other person in the world it could be but my cousin tom
poor mrs chiley started so that the sofa and lucilla's chair and the very room shook
she said herself afterwards that she felt as if somebody had discharged a pistol into her breast
she was so shocked and startled that she threw off all her coverings and the afghanistan blanket mrs beverley had sent and put her tottering old feet to the floor and then she took her young friend solemnly by both her hands
oh lucilla my poor dear
she cried you have gone and done it without thinking what you were doing
you have taken it into your head that it was all over and that there was nothing more to look for
and you are only nineandtwenty lucilla and many a girl marries very wellbetter than commonlong after she's nineandtwenty and i know for a factoh
my poor dear child i know for a certain factthat mr ashburton was coming forward
he as good as said it to lady richmond lucilla
he as good as said as soon as the election was overand now you have gone and got impatient and thrown yourself away
miss marjoribanks was quite carried away for the moment by this flood of sorrowful eloquence
she was silenced and had nothing to answer and accepted it as in some respect the just penalty for the disappointment she was causing everybody
she let mrs chiley say out her say and then she restored the old lady to her sofa and made her comfortable and covered her up with all her wraps and blankets
though she ran on in a feeble strain all the time weeping and lamenting lucilla took no notice
she wrapped her old friend up and put her pillows just as she liked them and sat down again on the low chair and by that time the poor old lady had sunk into a faint sob of vexation and disappointment and had given her remonstrances up
now i will tell you all about it said miss marjoribanks
i knew you would be surprised and if it would be any comfort to you dear mrs chiley to know that mr ashburton did  and you refused him lucilla
mrs chiley asked with horror in her face
ought i to have accepted him when there was somebody i liked better
said lucilla with the force of conscious virtue and you used always to say just the contrary
one great thing that supported me was that you would be sure to understand
i did not know it at the time said miss marjoribanks with sweet confidence and simplicity but i see it all now
why it never came to anything before you know was that i never could in my heart have accepted anybody but tom
mrs chiley turned round with unaffected surprise which was not unmingled with awe
up to this moment she had been under the impression that it was the blindness and folly and stupidity of the gentlemen which had kept it from ever coming to anything
it was altogether a new light that broke upon her now confusing though on the whole satisfactory but for the moment she was struck dumb and had no answer to make
i never knew it myself untilquite lately said miss marjoribanks with confidential tenderness and i don't think i could tell it to any one but you
dear mrs chiley you have always taken such an interest in me
i sent him away you know and thought i was only fond of him because he was my cousin
and then there were all the others and some of them were very nice but always when it came to the pointand it never came into my head that tom was at the bottom of it allnever till the other day
mrs chiley was still so much confounded by this unexpected revelation that it was some time before she could find her voice and even now the light penetrated slowly into her mind and it was only by degrees that she accepted the new fact thus presented to her faiththat it was not the gentlemen who were to blamethat it was all lucilla's or rather tom marjoribanks's fault
and mr ashburton lucilla
she asked faintly
i am very sorry said miss marjoribanks very very sorry but i don't think i can blame myself that i gave him encouragement you know
i may have been foolish at other times but i am sure i was very careful with him
it was all the election that was to blame
i spoke very frankly to him lucilla added for i knew he was a man to do me justice and it will always be a comfort to me to think that we had ourour explanation you know before i knew it was tom
well lucilla it is a great change said mrs chiley who could not reconcile herself to the new condition of affairs
i don't mean to pretend that i can make up my mind to it all at once
it seems so strange that you should have been setting your heart on some one all these ten years and never saying a word i wonder how you could do it
and when people were always in the hopes that you would marry at home as it were and settle in carlingford
i am sure your poor dear papa would be as much astonished as anybody
and i suppose now he will take you away to devonshire where his mother lives and we shall never see you any more
and once more mrs chiley gave a little sob
the firs would almost have been as good as grange lane she said and the member for carlingford lucilla
as for miss marjoribanks she knelt down by the side of the sofa and took her old friend as well as the blankets and pillows would permit into her arms
dear mrs chiley we are going to buy marchbank and settle said lucilla weeping a little for company
you could not think i would ever go far away from you
and as for being member for carlingford there are members for counties too miss marjoribanks said in her excitement
it was a revelation which came out unawares and which she never intended to utter but it threw a gleam of light over the new world of ambition and progress which was opened to lucilla's farseeing vision and mrs chiley could not but yield to the spell of mingled awe and sympathy which thrilled through her as she listened
it was not to be supposed that what lucilla did was done upon mere unthinking impulse and when she thought of marchbank there arose in mrs chiley's mind the slow beginnings of content
but lucilla the old lady said with solemnity as she gave her a last kiss of reconciliation and peace if all grange lane had taken their oaths to it i never could have believed had you not told me that after all it was to be tom
chapter the last   this was the hardest personal encounter which miss marjoribanks was subjected to but when the news circulated in grange lane there was first a dead pause of incredulity and amazement and then such a commotion as could be compared to nothing except a sudden squall at sea
people who had been going peaceably on their way at one moment thinking of nothing were to be seen the next buffeted by the wind of rumour and tossed about on the waves of astonishment
to speak less metaphorically but there are moments of emotion so overwhelming and unprecedented that they can be dealt with only in the language of metaphor every household in grange lane and at least half of the humbler houses in grove street and a large proportion of the other dwellings in carlingford were nearly as much agitated about lucilla's marriage as if it had been a daughter of their own
now that he was recalled to their minds in such a startling way people began to recollect with greater and greater distinctness that there was once a cousin you know and to remember him in his youth and even in his boyhood when he had been much in carlingford
and by degrees the grange lane people came to see that they knew a great deal about tom and to remind each other of the abrupt end of his last visit and of his going to india immediately after and of many a little circumstance in lucilla's looks and general demeanour which this dnouement seemed to make plain
lady richmond though she was a little annoyed about mr ashburton's disappointment decided at once that it was best to ignore that altogether and was quite glad to think that she had always said there must be somebody
she bore up a great deal too well against all her little disappointments she said when discussing the matter
when a girl does that one may be always sure there is somebody behindand you know i always said when she was not just talking or busy that there was a preoccupation in lucilla's eye
this was a speech which mrs woodburn as might have been expected made a great deal ofbut notwithstanding it had its effect in grange lane
going back upon their recollections most people were able to verify the fact that miss marjoribanks had borne her little disappointments very well and that there was sometimes a preoccupation in her eye
the first was beyond dispute and as for the second it was a thing which did not require a very great stretch of imagination to supposeand the unexpected sensation of finding at last a distinct bit of romance to round off lucilla's history was pleasant to most people
if she had married mr ashburton it would have been so far as anything connected with miss marjoribanks could be a commonplace conclusion
but now she had upset everybody's theories and made an altogether original and unlookedfor ending for herself which was a thing to have been expected from lucilla though nobody could have foreseen the special turn which her originality would take
and nothing could have come in more appropriately after the election when people felt the blank of ordinary existence just beginning to settle down upon them again
it kept all carlingford in conversation for a longer time than might be supposed in these busy days for there was not only the fact itself but what they were to do and where they were to go to be discussed
and then tom himself began to be visible about grange lane and he had heaps of indian things among his baggage and recollected so affectionately the people he used to know and dispensed his curiosities with such a liberal hand that the heart of carlingford was touched
he had a way of miscalculating distances as has been said and exercised some kind of magnetic influence upon all the little tables and unsteady articles of furniture which somehow seemed to fall if he but looked at them
but on the other hand john brown who had in hand the sale of marchbank found him the most straightforward and clearheaded of clients
the two had all the preliminaries arranged before any other intending purchaser had time to turn the matter over in his mind
and tom had the old brick house full of workmen before anybody knew it was his
when the summer had fairly commenced he went over and lived there and saw to everything and went so far as to fit up the drawingroom with the same wellremembered tint of pale green which had been found ten years ago to suit so well with lucilla's complexion
it was perhaps a little hazardous to repeat the experiment for green as everybody knows is a very trying colour but it was a most touching and triumphant proof that to tom at least lucilla was as young as ever and had not even begun to go off
it was mr holden who supplied everything and he was naturally proud of the trust thus reposed in him and formed the very highest opinion of his customer and it was probably from his enthusiasm on this subject that might be traced the commencement of that singular revolution of sentiment in grange lane which suddenly woke up all in an instant without knowing how to recognise the existence of mr marjoribanks and to forget the undue familiarity which had ventured upon the name of tom
when lucilla went over in the most proper and decorous way under the charge of aunt jemima to see her future home the sight of the village at marchbank was sweet to her eyes
that it was not by any means sweet to any other sense did but enhance miss marjoribanks's satisfaction
a year after this
she said to herself and her bosom swelled for to realise clearly how much she had it in her power to do for her fellowcreatures was indeed a pleasure
it occupied her a great deal more than the gardens did which tom was arranging so carefully or even than the kitchen which she inspected for the information of nancy for at that time the drawingroom was not fitted up
lucilla's eyes went over the moral wilderness with the practical glance of a statesman and at the same time the sanguine enthusiasm of a philanthropist
she saw of what it was capable and already in imagination the desert blossomed like a rose before her beneficent steps and the sweet sense of welldoing rose in her breast
and then to see tom at marchbank was to see his qualities
he was not a man of original mind nor one who would be likely to take a bold initiative
considering all the circumstances that was a gift which was scarcely to be wished for but he had a perfect genius for carrying out a suggestion which it need scarcely be added was a faculty that considering the good fortune which providence had so long reserved for him made his character as near perfect as humanity permits
lucilla felt indeed as she drove away that approbation of providence which a wellregulated mind in possession of most things which it desires might be expected to feel
other delusive fancies had one time and another swept across her horizon but after all there could be no doubt that only thus could she have been fitly mated and full development afforded to all the resources of her spirit
as the carriage passed the firs she sighed and put down her veil with a natural sentiment but still she felt it was for the best
the member for carlingford must be a busy man occupied about his own affairs and with little leisure for doing good to his fellowcreatures except in a parliamentary way
and there are members for counties as well lucilla in the depths of her soul said to herself
then there rose up before her a vision of a parish saved a village reformed a county reorganised and a triumphant election at the end the recompense and crown of all which should put the government of the country itself to a certain extent into competent hands
this was the celestial vision which floated before miss marjoribanks's eyes as she drove into carlingford and recollected notwithstanding occasional moments of discouragement the successful work she had done and the good she had achieved in her native town
it was but the natural culmination of her career that transferred her from the town to the county and held out to her the glorious task of serving her generation in a twofold way among the poor and among the rich
if a momentary sigh for grange lane which was about to lose her breathed from her lips it was sweetened by a smile of satisfaction for the county which was about to gain her
the lighter preface of life was past and lucilla had the comfort of feeling that its course had been full of benefit to her fellowcreatures and now a larger sphere opened before her feet and miss marjoribanks felt that the arrangements of providence were on the whole full of discrimination and that all was for the best and she had not lived in vain
this being the case perhaps it is not necessary to go much further into detail
mr ashburton never said anything about his disappointment as might have been expected
when he did mention that eventful day at all he said that he had happened accidentally to be calling on miss marjoribanks the day her cousin came home and saw at once the state of affairs and he sent her a very nice present when she was married
after all it was not her fault
if providence had ordained that it was to be tom how could lucilla fly in the face of such an ordinance
and at the same time there was to both parties the consoling reflection that whatever might happen to them as individuals the best man had been chosen for carlingford which was an abiding benefit to all concerned
under all the circumstances it was to be looked for that miss marjoribanks's spirits should improve even in her mourning and that the tenacity with which she clung to her father's house should yield to the changed state of affairs
this was so much the case that lucilla took heart to show mrs rider all over it and to point out all the conveniences to her and even with a sigh to call her attention to the bell which hung over the doctor's bedroom door
it breaks my heart to hear it miss marjoribanks said but still dr rider will find it a great convenience
it was a very nice house and so the new doctor's wife who had not been used to anything so spacious was very willing to say and instead of feeling any grudge against the man who was thus in every respect to take her father's place so sweet are the softening influences of time and personal wellbeing that lucilla who was always so goodnatured made many little arrangements for their comfort and even left the carpets which was a thing nobody could have expected of her and which aunt jemima did not scruple to condemn
they are all fitted lucilla said and if they were taken up they would be spoiled and besides we could have no use for them at marchbank
it was a very kind thing to do and simplified matters very much for the riders who were not rich
but aunt jemima in the background could not but pull lucilla's sleeve and mutter indistinct remarks about a valuation which nobody paid any particular attention to at the moment as there were so many things much more important to think of and to do
and the presents that came pouring in from every quarter were enough to have made up for twenty carpets
lucilla got testimonials so to speak from every side and all carlingford interested itself as has been said in all the details of the marriage as if it had been a daughter of its own
and yet it is odd to think that after all i shall never be anything but lucilla marjoribanks
she said in the midst of all her triumphs with a certain pensiveness
if there could be any name that would have suited her better or is surrounded by more touching associations we leave it to her other friends to find out for at the moment of taking leave of her there is something consoling to our own mind in the thought that lucilla can now suffer no change of name
as she was in the first freshness of her youthful daring when she rose like the sun upon the chaos of society in carlingford so is she now as she goes forth into the county to carry light and progress there
and in this reflection there is surely comfort for the few remaining malcontents whom not even his own excellent qualities and lucilla's happiness can reconcile to the fact that after all it was tom
