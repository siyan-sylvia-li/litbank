chapter i  the slave's social circle
with the growing population in the southern states the increase of mulattoes has been very great
society does not frown upon the man who sits with his halfwhite child upon his knee whilst the mother stands a slave behind his chair
in nearly all the cities and towns of the slave states the real negro or clear black does not amount to more than one in four of the slave population
this fact is of itself the best evidence of the degraded and immoral condition of the relation of master and slave
throughout the southern states there is a class of slaves who in most of the towns are permitted to hire their time from their owners and who are always expected to pay a high price
this class is the mulatto women distinguished for their fascinating beauty
the handsomest of these usually pay the greatest amount for their time
many of these women are the favorites of men of property and standing who furnish them with the means of compensating their owners and not a few are dressed in the most extravagant manner
when we take into consideration the fact that no safeguard is thrown around virtue and no inducement held out to slavewomen to be pure and chaste we will not be surprised when told that immorality and vice pervade the cities and towns of the south to an extent unknown in the northern states
indeed many of the slavewomen have no higher aspiration than that of becoming the finelydressed mistress of some white man
at negro balls and parties this class of women usually make the most splendid appearance and are eagerly sought after in the dance or to entertain in the drawingroom or at the table
a few years ago among the many slavewomen in richmond virginia who hired their time of their masters was agnes a mulatto owned by john graves esq and who might be heard boasting that she was the daughter of an american senator
although nearly forty years of age at the time of which we write agnes was still exceedingly handsome
more than half white with long black hair and deep blue eyes no one felt like disputing with her when she urged her claim to her relationship with the anglosaxon
in her younger days agnes had been a housekeeper for a young slaveholder and in sustaining this relation had become the mother of two daughters
after being cast aside by this young man the slavewoman betook herself to the business of a laundress and was considered to be the most tasteful woman in richmond at her vocation
isabella and marion the two daughters of agnes resided with their mother and gave her what aid they could in her business
the mother however was very choice of her daughters and would allow them to perform no labor that would militate against their ladylike appearance
agnes early resolved to bring up her daughters as ladies as she termed it
as the girls grew older the mother had to pay a stipulated price for them per month
her notoriety as a laundress of the first class enabled her to put an extra charge upon the linen that passed through her hands and although she imposed little or no work upon her daughters she was enabled to live in comparative luxury and have her daughters dressed to attract attention especially at the negro balls and parties
although the term negro ball is applied to these gatherings yet a large portion of the men who attend them are whites
negro balls and parties in the southern states especially in the cities and towns are usually made up of quadroon women a few negro men and any number of white gentlemen
these are gatherings of the most democratic character
bankers merchants lawyers doctors and their clerks and students all take part in these social assemblies upon terms of perfect equality
the father and son not unfrequently meet and dance alike at a negro ball
it was at one of these parties that henry linwood the son of a wealthy and retired gentleman of richmond was first introduced to isabella the oldest daughter of agnes
the young man had just returned from harvard college where he had spent the previous five years
isabella was in her eighteenth year and was admitted by all who knew her to be the handsomest girl colored or white in the city
on this occasion she was attired in a skyblue silk dress with deep black lace flounces and bertha of the same
on her wellmoulded arms she wore massive gold bracelets while her rich black hair was arranged at the back in broad basket plaits ornamented with pearls and the front in the french style a la imperatrice which suited her classic face to perfection
marion was scarcely less richly dressed than her sister
henry linwood paid great attention to isabella which was looked upon with gratification by her mother and became a matter of general conversation with all present
of course the young man escorted the beautiful quadroon home that evening and became the favorite visitor at the house of agnes
it was on a beautiful moonlight night in the month of august when all who reside in tropical climates are eagerly grasping for a breath of fresh air that henry linwood was in the garden which surrounded agnes' cottage with the young quadroon by his side
he drew from his pocket a newspaper wet from the press and read the following advertisement  noticeseventynine negroes will be offered for sale on monday september  at  o'clock being the entire stock of the late john graves in an excellent condition and all warranted against the common vices
among them are several mechanics ablebodied fieldhands ploughboys and women with children some of them very prolific affording a rare opportunity for any one who wishes to raise a strong and healthy lot of servants for their own use
also several mulatto girls of rare personal qualitiestwo of these very superior
among the above slaves advertised for sale were agnes and her two daughters
ere young linwood left the quadroon that evening he promised her that he would become her purchaser and make her free and her own mistress
mr graves had long been considered not only an excellent and upright citizen of the first standing among the whites but even the slaves regarded him as one of the kindest of masters
having inherited his slaves with the rest of his property he became possessed of them without any consultation or wish of his own
he would neither buy nor sell slaves and was exceedingly careful in letting them out that they did not find oppressive and tyrannical masters
no slave speculator ever dared to cross the threshold of this planter of the old dominion
he was a constant attendant upon religious worship and was noted for his general benevolence
the american bible society the american tract society and the cause of foreign missions found in him a liberal friend
he was always anxious that his slaves should appear well on the sabbath and have an opportunity of hearing the word of god
chapter ii  the negro sale
as might have been expected the day of sale brought an usually large number together to compete for the property to be sold
farmers who make a business of raising slaves for the market were there and slavetraders who make a business of buying human beings in the slaveraising states and taking them to the far south were also in attendance
men and women too who wished to purchase for their own use had found their way to the slave sale
in the midst of the throne was one who felt a deeper interest in the result of the sale than any other of the bystanders
this was young linwood
true to his promise he was there with a blank bankcheck in his pocket awaiting with impatience to enter the list as a bidder for the beautiful slave
it was indeed a heartrending scene to witness the lamentations of these slaves all of whom had grown up together on the old homestead of mr graves and who had been treated with great kindness by that gentleman during his life
now they were to be separated and form new relations and companions
such is the precarious condition of the slave
even when with a good master there is no certainty of his happiness in the future
the less valuable slaves were first placed upon the auctionblock one after another and sold to the highest bidder
husbands and wives were separated with a degree of indifference that is unknown in any other relation in life
brothers and sisters were tom from each other and mothers saw their children for the last time on earth
it was late in the day and when the greatest number of persons were thought to be present when agnes and her daughters were brought out to the place of sale
the mother was first put upon the auctionblock and sold to a noted negro trader named jennings
marion was next ordered to ascend the stand which she did with a trembling step and was sold for 
all eyes were now turned on isabella as she was led forward by the auctioneer
the appearance of the handsome quadroon caused a deep sensation among the crowd
there she stood with a skin as fair as most white women her features as beautifully regular as any of her sex of pure anglosaxon blood her long black hair done up in the neatest manner her form tall and graceful and her whole appearance indicating one superior to her condition
the auctioneer commenced by saying that miss isabella was fit to deck the drawingroom of the finest mansion in virginia
how much gentlemen for this real albinofit fancygirl for any one
she enjoys good health and has a sweet temper
how much do you say
five hundred dollars
only five hundred for such a girl as this
gentlemen she is worth a deal more than that sum
you certainly do not know the value of the article you are bidding on
here gentlemen i hold in my hand a paper certifying that she has a good moral character
seven hundred
ah gentlemen that is something like
this paper also states that she is very intelligent
eight hundred
she was first sprinkled then immersed and is now warranted to be a devoted christian and perfectly trustworthy
nine hundred dollars
nine hundred and fifty
one thousand
eleven hundred
here the bidding came to a dead stand
the auctioneer stopped looked around and began in a rough manner to relate some anecdote connected with the sale of slaves which he said had come under his own observation
at this juncture the scene was indeed a most striking one
the laughing joking swearing smoking spitting and talking kept up a continual hum and confusion among the crowd while the slavegirl stood with tearful eyes looking alternately at her mother and sister and toward the young man whom she hoped would become her purchaser
the chastity of this girl now continued the auctioneer is pure
she has never been from under her mother's care
she is virtuous and as gentle as a dove
the bids here took a fresh start and went on until  was reached
the auctioneer once more resorted to his jokes and concluded by assuring the company that isabella was not only pious but that she could make an excellent prayer
nineteen hundred dollars
two thousand
this was the last bid and the quadroon girl was struck off and became the property of henry linwood
this was a virginia slaveauction at which the bones sinews blood and nerves of a young girl of eighteen were sold for  her moral character for  her superior intellect for  the benefits supposed to accrue from her having been sprinkled and immersed together with a warranty of her devoted christianity for  her ability to make a good prayer for  and her chastity for  more
this too in a city thronged with churches whose tall spires look like so many signals pointing to heaven but whose ministers preach that slavery a godordained institution
the slaves were speedily separated and taken along by their respective masters
jennings the slavespeculator who had purchased agnes and her daughter marion with several of the other slaves took them to the county prison where he usually kept his human cattle after purchasing them previous to starting for the new orleans market
linwood had already provided a place for isabella to which she was taken
the most trying moment for her was when she took leave of her mother and sister
the goodby of the slave is unlike that of any other class in the community
it is indeed a farewell forever
with tears streaming down their cheeks they embraced and commanded each other to god who is no respecter of persons and before whom master and slave must one day appear
chapter iii  the slave speculator
dick jennings the slavespeculator was one of the few northern men who go to the south and throw aside their honest mode of obtaining a living and resort to trading in human beings
a more repulsive looking person could scarcely be found in any community of bad looking men
tall lean and lank with high cheekbones face much pitted with the smallpox gray eyes with red eyebrows and sandy whiskers he indeed stood alone without mate or fellow in looks
jennings prided himself upon what he called his goodness of heart and was always speaking of his humanity
as many of the slaves whom he intended taking to the new orleans market had been raised in richmond and had relations there he determined to leave the city early in the morning so as not to witness any of the scenes so common the departure of a slavegang to the far south
in this he was most successful for not even isabella who had called at the prison several times to see her mother and sister was aware of the time that they were to leave
the slavetrader started at early dawn and was beyond the confines of the city long before the citizens were out of their beds
as a slave regards a life on the sugar cotton or rice plantation as even worse than death they are ever on the watch for an opportunity to escape
the trader aware of this secures his victims in chains before he sets out on his journey
on this occasion jennings had the men chained in pairs while the women were allowed to go unfastened but were closely watched
after a march of eight days the company arrived on the banks of the ohio river where they took a steamer for the place of their destination
jennings had already advertised in the new orleans papers that he would be there with a prime lot of ablebodied slaves men and women fit for fieldservice with a few extra ones calculated for house servantsall between the ages of fifteen and twentyfive years but like most men who make a business of speculating in human beings he often bought many who were far advanced in years and would try to pass them off for five or six years younger than they were
few persons can arrive at anything approaching the real age of the negro by mere observation unless they are well acquainted with the race
therefore the slavetrader frequently carried out the deception with perfect impunity
after the steamer had left the wharf and was fairly out on the bosom of the broad mississippi the speculator called his servant pompey to him and instructed him as to getting the negroes ready for market
among the forty slaves that the trader had on this occasion were some whose appearance indicated that they had seen some years and had gone through considerable service
their gray hair and whiskers at once pronounced them to be above the ages set down in the trader's advertisement
pompey had long been with jennings and understood his business well and if he did not take delight in the discharge of his duty he did it at least with a degree of alacrity so that he might receive the approbation of his master
pomp as he was usually called by the trader was of real negro blood and would often say when alluding to himself dis nigger am no counterfeit he is de ginuine artikle
dis chile is none of your hafandhaf dere is no bogus about him
pompey was of low stature round face and like most of his race had a set of teeth which for whiteness and beauty could not be surpassed his eyes were large lips thick and hair short and woolly
pompey had been with jennings so long and had seen so much of buying and selling of his fellowcreatures that he appeared perfectly indifferent to the heartrending scenes which daily occurred in his presence
such is the force of habit    vice is a monster of such frightful mien   that to be hated needs but to be seen   but seen too oft familiar with its face   we first endure then pity then embrace
it was on the second day of the steamer's voyage that pompey selected five of the oldest slaves took them into a room by themselves and commenced preparing them for the market
now said he addressing himself to the company i is de chap dat is to get you ready for de orleans market so dat you will bring marser a good price
how old is you
addressing himself to a man not less than forty
if i live to see next sweetpotatodigging time i shall be either forty or fortyfive i don't know which
dat may be replied pompey but now you is only thirty years olddat's what marser says you is to be
i know i is more den dat responded the man
i can't help nuffin' about dat returned pompey but when you get into de market and any one ax you how old you is and you tell um you is forty or fortyfive marser will tie you up and cut you all to pieces
but if you tell urn dat you is only thirty den he won't
now remember dat you is thirty years old and no more
well den i guess i will only be thirty when dey ax me
what's your name
said pompey addressing himself to another
jeems
oh
uncle jim is it
yes
den you must have all them gray whiskers shaved off and all dem gray hairs plucked out of your head
this was all said by pompey in a manner which showed that he know what he was about
how old is you
asked pompey of a tall stronglooking man
what's your name
i am twentynine years old and my name is tobias but they calls me toby
well toby or mr tobias if dat will suit you better you are now twentythree years old dat's alldo you understand dat
yes replied toby
pompey now gave them all to understand how old they were to be when asked by persons who were likely to purchase and then went and reported to his master that the old boys were all right
be sure said jennings that the niggers don't forget what you have taught them for our luck this time in the market depends upon their appearance
if any of them have so many gray hairs that you cannot pluck them out take the blacking and brush and go at them
chapter iv  the boatrace
at eight o'clock on the evening of the third day of the passage the lights of another steamer were soon in the distance and apparently coming up very fast
this was the signal for a general commotion on board the patriot and everything indicated that a steamboatrace was at hand
nothing can exceed the excitement attendant upon the racing of steamers on the mississippi
by the time the boats had reached memphis they were side by side and each exerting itself to get in advance of the other
the night was clear the moon shining brightly and the boats so near to each other that the passengers were within speaking distance
on board the patriot the firemen were using oil lard butter and even bacon with woody for the purpose of raising the steam to its highest pitch
the blaze mingled with the black smoke that issued from the pipes of the other boat which showed that she also was burning something more combustible than wood
the firemen of both boats who were slaves were singing songs such as can only be heard on board a southern steamer
the boats now came abreast of each other and nearer and nearer until they were locked so that men could pass from one to the other
the wildest excitement prevailed among the men employed on the steamers in which the passengers freely participated
the patriot now stopped to take in passengers but still no steam was permitted to escape
on the starting of the boat again cold water was forced into the boilers by the feedpumps and as might have been expected one of the boilers exploded with terrific force carrying away the boilerdeck and tearing to pieces much of the machinery
one dense fog of steam filled every part of the vessel while shrieks groans and cries were heard on every side
men were running hither and thither looking for their wives and women wore flying about in the wildest confusion seeking for their husbands
dismay appeared on every countenance
the saloons and cabins soon looked more like hospitals than anything else but by this time the patriot had drifted to the shore and the other steamer had come alongside to render assistance to the disabled boat
the killed and wounded nineteen in number were put on shore and the patriot taken in tow by the washington was once more on her journey
it was halfpast twelve and the passengers instead of retiring to their berths once more assembled at the gamblingtables
the practice of gambling on the western waters has long been a source of annoyance to the more moral persons who travel on our great rivers
thousands of dollars often change owners during a passage from st louis or louisville to new orleans on a mississippi steamer
many men are completely ruined on such occasions and duels are often the consequence
go call my boy steward said mr jones as he took his cards one by one from the table
in a few minutes a finelooking brighteyed mulatto boy apparently about sixteen years of age was standing by his master's side at the table
i am broke all but my boy said jones as he ran his fingers through his cards but he is worth a thousand dollars and i will bet the half of him
i will call you said thompson as he laid five hundred dollars at the feet of the boy who was standing on the table and at the same time throwing down his cards before his adversary
you have beaten me said jones and a roar of laughter followed from the other gentleman as poor joe stepped down from the table
well i suppose i owe you half the nigger said thompson as he took hold of joe and began examining his limbs
yes replied jones he is half yours
let me have five hundred dollars and i will give you a bill of sale of the boy
go back to your bed said thompson to his chattel and remember that you now belong to me
the poor slave wiped the tears from his eyes as in obedience he turned to leave the table
my father gave me that boy said jones as he took the money and i hope mr thompson that you will allow me to redeem him
most certainly sir replied thompson
whenever you hand over the cool thousand the negro is yours
next morning as the passengers were assembling in the cabin and on deck and while the slaves were running about waiting on or looking for their masters poor joe was seen entering his new master's stateroom boots in hand
who do you belong to
inquired a gentleman of an old negro who passed along leading a fine newfoundland dog which he had been feeding
when i went to sleep las' night replied the slave i 'longed to massa carr but he bin gamblin' all night an' i don't know who i 'longs to dis mornin'
such is the uncertainty of a slave's life
he goes to bed at night the pampered servant of his young master with whom he has played in childhood and who would not see his slave abused under any consideration and gets up in the morning the property of a man whom he has never before seen
to behold five or six tables in the saloon of a steamer with half a dozen men playing cards at each with money pistols and bowieknives spread in splendid confusion before them is an ordinary thing on the mississippi river
chapter v  the young mother
on the fourth morning the patriot landed at grand gulf a beautiful town on the left bank of the mississippi
among the numerous passengers who came on board at rodney was another slavetrader with nine human chattels which he was conveying to the southern market
the passengers both ladies and gentlemen were startled at seeing among the new lot of slaves a woman so white as not to be distinguishable from the other white women on board
she had in her arms a child so white that no one would suppose a drop of african blood flowed through its blue veins
no one could behold that mother with her helpless babe without feeling that god would punish the oppressor
there she sat with an expressive and intellectual forehead and a countenance full of dignity and heroism her dark golden locks rolled back from her almost snowwhite forehead and floating over her swelling bosom
the tears that stood in her mild blue eyes showed that she was brooding over sorrows and wrongs that filled her bleeding heart
the hearts of the passersby grew softer while gazing upon that young mother as she pressed sweet kisses on the sad smiling lips of the infant that lay in her lap
the small dimpled hands of the innocent creature were slyly hid in the warm bosom on which the little one nestled
the blood of some proud southerner no doubt flowed through the veins of that child
when the boat arrived at natches a rather goodlooking genteelappearing man came on board to purchase a servant
this individual introduced himself to jennings as the rev
james wilson
the slavetrader conducted the preacher to the deckcabin where he kept his slaves and the man of god after having some questions answered selected agnes as the one best suited to his service
it seemed as if poor marion's heart would break when she found that she was to be separated from her mother
the preacher however appeared to be but little moved by their sorrow and took his newlypurchased victim on shore
agnes begged him to buy her daughter but he refused on the ground that he had no use for her
during the remainder of the passage marion wept bitterly
after a ran of a few hours the boat stopped at baton rouge where an additional number of passengers were taken on board among whom were a number of persons who had been attending the races at that place
gambling and drinking were now the order of the day
the next morning at ten o'clock the boat arrived at new orleans where the passengers went to their hotels and homes and the negroes to the slavepens
lizzie the white slavemother of whom we have already spoken created as much of a sensation by the fairness of her complexion and the alabaster whiteness of her child when being conveyed on shore at new orleans as she had done when brought on board at grand gulf
every one that saw her felt that slavery in the southern states was not confined to the negro
many had been taught to think that slavery was a benefit rather than an injury and those who were not opposed to the institution before now felt that if whites were to become its victims it was time at least that some security should be thrown around the anglosaxon to gave him from this servile and degraded position
chapter vi  the slavemarket
not far from canal street in the city of new orleans stands a large twostory flat building surrounded by a stone wall some twelve feet high the top of which is covered with bits of glass and so constructed as to prevent even the possibility of any one's passing over it without sustaining great injury
many of the rooms in this building resemble the cells of a prison and in a small apartment near the office are to be seen any number of iron collars hobbles handcuffs thumbscrews cowhides chains gags and yokes
a backyard enclosed by a high wall looks something like the playground attached to one of our large new england schools in which are rows of benches and swings
attached to the back premises is a goodsized kitchen where at the time of which we write two old negresses were at work stewing boiling and baking and occasionally wiping the perspiration from their furrowed and swarthy brows
the slavetrader jennings on his arrival at new orleans took up his quarters here with his gang of human cattle and the morning after at  o'clock they were exhibited for sale
first of all came the beautiful marion whose pale countenance and dejected look told how many sad hours she had passed since parting with her mother at natchez
there too was a poor woman who had been separated from her husband and another woman whose looks and manners were expressive of deep anguish sat by her side
there was uncle jeems with his whiskers off his face shaven clean and the gray hairs plucked out ready to be sold for ten years younger than he was
toby was also there with his face shaven and greased ready for inspection
the examination commenced and was carried on in such a manner as to shock the feelings of anyone not entirely devoid of the milk of human kindness
what are you wiping your eyes for
inquired a fat redfaced man with a white hat set on one side of his head and a cigar in his mouth of a woman who sat on one of the benches
because i left my man behind
oh if i buy you i will furnish you with a better man than you left
i've got lots of young bucks on my farm
i don't want and never will have another man replied the woman
what's your name
asked a man in a straw hat of a tall negro who stood with his arms folded across his breast leaning against the wall
my name is aaron sar
how old are you
twentyfive
where were you raised
in ole virginny sar
how many men have owned you
four
do you enjoy good health
yes sar
how long did you live with your first owner

i am a cottonplanter and if i buy you you will have to work in the cottonfield
my men pick one hundred and fifty pounds a day and the women one hundred and forty pounds and those who fail to perform their task receive five stripes for each pound that is wanting
now do you think you could keep up with the rest of the hands
i' don't know sar but i 'specs i'd have to
how long did you live with your third master
three years sar
why that makes you thirtythree
i thought you told me you were only twentyfive
aaron now looked first at the planter then at the trader and seemed perfectly bewildered
he had forgotten the lesson given him by pompey relative to his age and the planter's circuitous questionsdoubtless to find out the slave's real agehad thrown the negro off his guard
i must see your back so as to know how much you have been whipped before i think of buying
pompey who had been standing by during the examination thought that his services were now required and stepping forth with a degree of officiousness said to aaron  don't you hear de gemman tell you he wants to 'zamin you
cum unharness yo'seff ole boy and don't be standin' dar
aaron was soon examined and pronounced sound yet the conflicting statement about his age was not satisfactory
fortunately for marion she was spared the pain of undergoing such an examination
mr cardney a teller in one of the banks had just been married and wanted a maidservant for his wife and passing through the market in the early part of the day was pleased with the young slave's appearance and his dwelling the quadroon found a much better home than often falls to the lot of a slave sold in the new orleans market
chapter vii  the slaveholding parson
the rev
james wilson was a native of the state of connecticut where he was educated for the ministry in the methodist persuasion
his father was a strict follower of john wesley and spared no pains in his son's education with the hope that he would one day be as renowned as the leader of his sect
james had scarcely finished his education at new haven when he was invited by an uncle then on a visit to his father to spend a few months at natchez in mississippi
young wilson accepted his uncle's invitation and accompanied him to the south
few young men and especially clergymen going fresh from college to the south but are looked upon as geniuses in a small way and who are not invited to all the parties in the neighborhood
mr wilson was not an exception to this rule
the society into which he was thrown on his arrival at natchez was too brilliant for him not to be captivated by it and as might have been expected he succeeded in captivating a plantation with seventy slaves if not the heart of the lady to whom it belonged
added to this he became a popular preacher and had a large congregation with a snug salary
like other planters mr wilson confided the care of his farm to ned huckelby an overseer of high reputation in his way
the poplar farm as it was called was situated in a beautiful valley nine miles from natchez and near the mississippi river
the once unshorn face of nature had given way and the farm now blossomed with a splendid harvest
the neat cottage stood in a grove where lombardy poplars lift their tops almost to prop the skies where the willow locust and horsechestnut trees spread forth their branches and flowers never ceased to blossom
this was the parson's country residence where the family spent only two months during the year
his town residence was a fine villa seated on the brow of a hill at the edge of the city
it was in the kitchen of this house that agnes found her new home
mr wilson was every inch a democrat and early resolved that his people as he called his slaves should be wellfed and not overworked and therefore laid down the law and gospel to the overseer as well as to the slaves
it is my wish said he to mr carlingham an old schoolfellow who was spending a few days with himit is my wish that a new system be adopted on the plantations in this state
i believe that the sons of ham should have the gospel and i intend that mine shall have it
the gospel is calculated to make mankind better and none should be without it
what say you said carlingham about the right of man to his liberty
now carlingham you have begun to harp again about men's rights
i really wish that you could see this matter as i do'
i regret that i cannot see eye to eye with you said carlingham
i am a disciple of rousseau and have for years made the rights of man my study and i must confess to you that i see no difference between white and black as it regards liberty
now my dear carlingham would you really have the negroes enjoy the same rights as ourselves
i would most certainly
look at our great declaration of independence
look even at the constitution of our own connecticut and see what is said in these about liberty
i regard all this talk about rights as mere humbug
the bible is older than the declaration of independence and there i take my stand
a long discussion followed in which both gentlemen put forth their peculiar ideas with much warmth of feeling
during this conversation there was another person in the room seated by the window who although at work embroidering a fine collar paid minute attention to what was said
this was georgiana the only daughter of the parson who had but just returned from connecticut where she had finished her education
she had had the opportunity of contrasting the spirit of christianity and liberty in new england with that of slavery in her native state and had learned to feel deeply for the injured negro
georgiana was in her nineteenth year and had been much benefited by her residence of five years at the north
her form was tall and graceful her features regular and welldefined and her complexion was illuminated by the freshness of youth beauty and health
the daughter differed from both the father and visitor upon the subject which they had been discussing and as soon as an opportunity offered she gave it as her opinion that the bible was both the bulwark of christianity and of liberty
with a smile she said  of course papa will overlook my difference with him for although i am a native of the south i am by education and sympathy a northerner
mr wilson laughed appearing rather pleased than otherwise at the manner in which his daughter had expressed herself
from this georgiana took courage and continued  'thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself'
this single passage of scripture should cause us to have respect for the rights of the slave
true christian love is of an enlarged and disinterested nature
it loves all who love the lord jesus christ in sincerity without regard to color or condition
georgiana my dear you are an abolitionistyour talk is fanaticism
said mr wilson in rather a sharp tone but the subdued look of the girl and the presence of carlingham caused him to soften his language
mr wilson having lost his wife by consumption and georgiana being his only child he loved her too dearly to say more even if he felt disposed
a silence followed this exhortation from the young christian but her remarks had done a noble work
the father's heart was touched and the sceptic for the first time was viewing christianity in its true light
chapter viii  a night in the parson's kitchen
besides agnes whom mr wilson had purchased from the slavetrader jennings he kept a number of houseservants
the chief one of these was sam who must be regarded as second only to the parson himself
if a dinnerparty was in contemplation or any company was to be invited after all the arrangements had been talked over by the minister and his daughter
sam was sure to be consulted on the subject by miss georgy as miss wilson was called by all the servants
if furniture crockery or anything was to be purchased sam felt that he had been slighted if his opinion was not asked
as to the marketing he did it all
he sat at the head of the servants' table in the kitchen and was master of the ceremonies
a single look from him was enough to silence any conversation or noise among the servants in the kitchen or in any other part of the premises
there is in the southern states a great amount of prejudice in regard to color even among the negroes themselves
the nearer the negro or mulatto approaches to the white the more he seems to feel his superiority over those of a darker hue
this is no doubt the result of the prejudice that exists on the part of the whites against both the mulattoes and the blacks
sam was originally from kentucky and through the instrumentality of one of his young masters whom he had to take to school he had learned to read so as to be well understood and owing to that fact was considered a prodigy not only among his own master's slaves but also among those of the town who knew him
sam had a great wish to follow in the footsteps of his master and be a poet and was therefore often heard singing doggerels of his own composition
but there was one drawback to sam and that was his color
he was one of the blackest of his race
this he evidently regarded as a great misfortune but he endeavored to make up for it in dress
mr wilson kept his house servants well dressed and as for sam he was seldom seen except in a ruffled shirt
indeed the washerwoman feared him more than any one else in the house
agnes had been inaugurated chief of the kitchen department and had a general supervision of the household affairs
alfred the coachman peter and hetty made up the remainder of the houseservants
besides these mr wilson owned eight slaves who were masons
these worked in the city
being mechanics they were let out to greater advantage than to keep them on the farm
every sunday evening mr wilson's servants including the bricklayers assembled in the kitchen where the events of the week were fully discussed and commented upon
it was on a sunday evening in the month of june that there was a party at mr wilson's house and according to custom in the southern states the ladies had their maidservants with them
tea had been served in the house and the servants including the strangers had taken their seats at the table in the kitchen
sam being a single gentleman was unusually attentive to the ladies on this occasion
he seldom let a day pass without spending an hour or two in combing and brushing his har
he had an idea that fresh butter was better for his hair than any other kind of grease and therefore on churning days half a pound of butter had always to be taken out before it was salted
when he wished to appear to great advantage he would grease his face to make it shiny
therefore on the evening of the party when all the servants were at the table sam cut a big figure
there he sat with his wool well combed and buttered face nicely greased and his ruffles extending five or six inches from his bosom
the parson in his drawingroom did not make a more imposing appearance than did his servant on this occasion
i is bin had my fortune tole last sunday night said sam while helping one of the girls
indeed
cried half a dozen voices
yes continued he aunt winny tole me i's to hab de prettiest yallah gal in de town and dat i's to be free
all eyes were immediately turned toward sally johnson who was seated near sam
i 'specs i see somebody blush at dat remark said alfred

i admires your judgment werry much i 'sures you
dar's plenty ob susceptible an' welldressed houseserbants dat a gal ob her looks can git widout takin' up wid dem common darkies
the evening's entertainment concluded by sam relating a little of his own experience while with his first master in old kentucky
this master was a doctor and had a large practice among his neighbors doctoring both masters and slaves
when sam was about fifteen years old his master set him to grinding up ointment and making pills
as the young student grew older and became more practised in his profession his services were of more importance to the doctor
the physician having a good business and a large number of his patients being slavesthe most of whom had to call on the doctor when illhe put sam to bleeding pulling teeth and administering medicine to the slaves
sam soon acquired the name among the slaves of the black doctor
with this appellation he was delighted and no regular physician could have put on more airs than did the black doctor when his services were required
in bleeding he must have more bandages and would rub and smack the arm more than the doctor would have thought of
sam was once seen taking out a tooth for one of his patients and nothing appeared more amusing
he got the poor fellow down on his back and then getting astride of his chest he applied the turnkeys and pulled away for dear life
unfortunately he had got hold of the wrong tooth and the poor man screamed as loud as he could but it was to no purpose for sam had him fast and after a pretty severe tussle out came the sound grinder
the young doctor now saw his mistake but consoled himself with the thought that as the wrong tooth was out of the way there was more room to get at the right one
bleeding and a dose of calomel were always considered indispensable by the old boss and as a matter of course sam followed in his footsteps
on one occasion the old doctor was ill himself so as to be unable to attend to his patients
a slave with pass in hand called to receive medical advice and the master told sam to examine him and see what he wanted
this delighted him beyond measure for although he had been acting his part in the way of giving out medicine as the master ordered it he had never been called upon by the latter to examine a patient and this seemed to convince him after all that he was no sham doctor
as might have been expected he cut a rare figure in his first examination
placing himself directly opposite his patient and folding his arms across his breast looking very knowingly he began  what's de matter wid you
i is sick
where is you sick
here replied the man putting his hand upon his stomach
put out your tongue continued the doctor
the man ran out his tongue at full length
let me feel your pulse at the same time taking his patient's hand in his and placing his fingers upon his pulse he said  ah
your case is a bad one ef i don't do something for you and dat pretty quick you'll be a gone coons and dat's sartin
at this the man appeared frightened and inquired what was the matter with him in answer to which sam said  i done told dat your case is a bad one and dat's enuff
on sam's returning to his master's bedside the latter said  well sam what do you think is the matter with him
his stomach is out ob order sar he replied
what do you think had better be done for him
i tink i'd better bleed him and gib him a dose ob calomel returned sam
so to the latter's gratification the master let him have his own way
on one occasion when making pills and ointment sam made a great mistake
he got the preparations for both mixed together so that he could not legitimately make either
but fearing that if he threw the stuff away his master would flog him and being afraid to inform his superior of the mistake he resolved to make the whole batch of pill and ointment stuff into pills
he well knew that the powder over the pills would hide the inside and the fact that most persons shut their eyes when taking such medicine led the young doctor to feel that all would be right in the end
therefore sam made his pills boxed them up put on the labels and placed them in a conspicuous position on one of the shelves
sam felt a degree of anxiety about his pills however
it was a strange mixture and he was not certain whether it would kill or cure but he was willing that it should be tried
at last the young doctor had his vanity gratified
col tallen one of dr saxondale's patients drove up one morning and sam as usual ran out to the gate to hold the colonel's horse
call your master said the colonel i will not get out
the doctor was soon beside the carriage and inquired about the health of his patient
after a little consultation the doctor returned to his office took down a box of sam's new pills and returned to the carriage
take two of these every morning and night said the doctor and if you don't feel relieved double the dose
good gracious exclaimed sam in an undertone when he heard his master tell the colonel how to take the pills
it was several days before sam could learn the result of his new medicine
one afternoon about a fortnight after the colonel's visit sam saw his master's patient riding up to the gate on horseback
the doctor happened to be in the yard and met the colonel and said  how are you now
i am entirely recovered replied the patient
those pills of yours put me on my feet the next day
i knew they would rejoined the doctor
sam was near enough to hear the conversation and was delighted beyond description
the negro immediately ran into the kitchen amongst his companions and commenced dancing
what de matter wid you
inquired the cook
i is de greatest doctor in dis country replied sam
ef you ever get sick call on me
no matter what ails you i is de man dat can cure you in no time
if you do hab de backache de rheumaties de headache de coller morbus fits er any ting else sam is de gentleman dat can put you on your feet wid his pills
for a long time after sam did little else than boast of his skill as a doctor
we have said that the black doctor was full of wit and good sense
indeed in that respect he had scarcely an equal in the neighborhood
although his master resided some little distance out of the city sam was always the first man in all the negro balls and parties in town
when his master could give him a pass he went and when he did not give him one he would steal away after his master had retired and run the risk of being taken up by the nightwatch
of course the master never knew anything of the absence of the servant at night without permission
as the negroes at these parties tried to excel each other in the way of dress sam was often at a loss to make that appearance that his heart desired but his ready wit ever helped him in this
when his master had retired to bed at night it was the duty of sam to put out the lights and take out with him his master's clothes and boots and leave them in the office until morning and then black the boots brush the clothes and return them to his master's room
having resolved to attend a dressball one night without his master's permission and being perplexed for suitable garments sam determined to take his master's
so dressing himself in the doctor's clothes even to his boots and hat off the negro started for the city
being well acquainted with the usual walk of the patrols he found no difficulty in keeping out of their way
as might have been expected sam was the great gun with the ladies that night
the next morning sam was back home long before his master's time for rising and the clothes were put in their accustomed place
for a long time sam had no difficulty in attiring himself for parties but the old proverb that it is a long lane that has no turning was verified in the negro's case
one stormy night when the rain was descending in torrents the doctor heard a rap at his door
it was customary with him when called up at night to visit a patient to ring for sam
but this time the servant was nowhere to be found
the doctor struck a light and looked for clothes they too were goneit was twelve o'clock and the doctor's clothes hat boots and even his watch were nowhere to be found
here was a pretty dilemma for a doctor to be in
it was some time before the physician could fit himself out so as to mike the visit
at last however he started with one of the farmhorses for sam had taken the doctor's best saddlehorse
the doctor felt sure that the negro had robbed him and was on his way to canada but in this he was mistaken
sam had gone to the city to attend a ball and had decked himself out in his master's best suit
the physician returned before morning and again retired to bed but with little hope of sleep for his thoughts were with his servant and horse
at six o'clock in walked sam with his master's clothes and the boots neatly blacked
the watch was placed on the shelf and the hat in its place
sam had not met any of the servants and was therefore entirely ignorant of what had occurred during his absence
what have you been about sir and where was you last night when i was called
said the doctor
i don't know sir
i 'spose i was asleep replied sam
but the doctor was not to be so easily satisfied after having been put to so much trouble in hunting up another suit without the aid of sam
after breakfast sam was taken into the barn tied up and severely flogged with the cat which brought from him the truth concerning his absence the previous night
this forever put an end to his fine appearance at the negro parties
had not the doctor been one of the most indulgent of masters he would not have escaped with merely a severe whipping
as a matter of course sam had to relate to his companions that evening in mr wilson's kitchen all his adventures as a physician while with his old master
chapter ix  the man of honor
augustine cardinay the purchaser of marion was from the green mountains of vermont and his feelings were opposed to the holding of slaves but his young wife persuaded him in into the idea that it was no worse to own a slave than to hire one and pay the money to another
hence it was that he had been induced to purchase marion
adolphus morton a young physician from the same state and who had just commenced the practice of his profession in new orleans was boarding with cardinay when marion was brought home
the young physician had been in new orleans but a very few weeks and had seen but little of slavery
in his own mountainhome he had been taught that the slaves of the southern states were negroes and if not from the coast of africa the descendants of those who had been imported
he was unprepared to behold with composure a beautiful white girl of sixteen in the degraded position of a chattel slave
the blood chilled in his young heart as he heard cardinay tell how by bantering with the trader he had bought her two hundred dollars less than he first asked
his very looks showed that she had the deepest sympathies of his heart
marion had been brought up by her mother to look after the domestic concerns of her cottage in virginia and well knew how to perform the duties imposed upon her
mrs cardinay was much pleased with her new servant and often mentioned her good qualities in the presence of mr morton
after eight months acquaintance with marion morton's sympathies ripened into love which was most cordially reciprocated by the friendless and injured child of sorrow
there was but one course which the young man could honorably pursue and that was to purchase marion and make her his lawful wife and this he did immediately for he found mr and mrs cardinay willing to second his liberal intentions
the young man after purchasing marion from cardinay and marrying her took lodgings in another part of the city
a private teacher was called in and the young wife was taught some of those accomplishments so necessary for one taking a high position in good society
dr morton soon obtained a large and influential practice in his profession and with it increased in wealth but with all his wealth he never owned a slave
probably the fact that he had raised his wife from that condition kept the hydraheaded system continually before him
to the credit of marion be it said she used every means to obtain the freedom of her mother who had been sold to parson wilson at natchez
her efforts however had come too late for agnes had died of a fever before the arrival of dr morton's agent
marion found in adolphus morton a kind and affectionate husband and his wish to purchase her mother although unsuccessful had doubly endeared him to her
ere a year had elapsed from the time of their marriage mrs morton presented her husband with a lovely daughter who seemed to knit their hearts still closer together
this child they named jane and before the expiration of the second year they were blessed with another daughter whom they named adrika
these children grew up to the ages of ten and eleven and were then sent to the north to finish their education and receive that refinement which young ladies cannot obtain in the slave states
chapter x  the quadroon's home  a few miles out of richmond is a pleasant place with here and there a beautiful cottage surrounded by trees so as scarcely to be seen
among these was one far retired from the public roads and almost hidden among the trees
this was the spot that henry linwood had selected for isabella the eldest daughter of agnes
the young man hired the house furnished it and placed his mistress there and for many months no one in his father's family knew where he spent his leisure hours
when henry was not with her isabella employed herself in looking after her little garden and the flowers that grew in front of her cottage
the passionflower peony dahlia laburnum and other plant so abundant in warm climates under the tasteful hand of isabella lavished their beauty upon this retired spot and miniature paradise
although isabella had been assured by henry that she should be free and that he would always consider her as his wife she nevertheless felt that she ought to be married and acknowledged by him
but this was an impossibility under the state laws even had the young man been disposed to do what was right in the matter
related as he was however to one of the first families in virginia he would not have dared to marry a woman of so low an origin even had the laws been favorable
here in this secluded grove unvisited by any other except her lover isabella lived for years
she had become the mother of a lovely daughter which its father named clotelle
the complexion of the child was still fairer than that of its mother
indeed she was not darker than other white children and as she grew older she more and more resembled her father
as time passed away henry became negligent of isabella and his child so much so that days and even weeks passed without their seeing him or knowing where he was
becoming more acquainted with the world and moving continually in the society of young women of his own station the young man felt that isabella was a burden to him and having as some would say outgrown his love he longed to free himself of the responsibility yet every time he saw the child he felt that he owed it his fatherly care
henry had now entered into political life and been elected to a seat in the legislature of his native state and in his intercourse with his friends had become acquainted with gertrude miller the daughter of a wealthy gentleman living near richmond
both henry and gertrude were very goodlooking and a mutual attachment sprang up between them
instead of finding fault with the unfrequent visits of henry isabella always met him with a smile and tried to make both him and herself believe that business was the cause of his negligence
when he was with her she devoted every moment of her time to him and never failed to speak of the growth and increasing intelligence of clotelle
the child had grown so large as to be able to follow its father on his departure out to the road
but the impression made on henry's feelings by the devoted woman and her child was momentary
his heart had grown hard and his acts were guided by no fixed principle
henry and gertrude had been married nearly two years before isabella knew anything of the event and it was merely by accident that she became acquainted with the facts
one beautiful afternoon when isabella and clotelle were picking wild strawberries some two miles from their home and near the roadside they observed a onehorse chaise driving past
the mother turned her face from the carriage not wishing to be seen by strangers little dreaming that the chaise contained henry and his wife
the child however watched the chaise and startled her mother by screaming out at the top of her voice papa
papa
and clapped her little hands for joy
the mother turned in haste to look at the strangers and her eyes encountered those of henry's pale and dejected countenance
gertrude's eyes were on the child
the swiftness with which henry drove by could not hide from his wife the striking resemblance of the child to himself
the young wife had heard the child exclaim papa
papa
and she immediately saw by the quivering of his lips and the agitation depicted in his countenance that all was not right
who is that woman
and why did that child call you papa
she inquired with a trembling voice
henry was silent he knew not what to say and without another word passing between them they drove home
on reaching her room gertrude buried her face in her handkerchief and wept
she loved henry and when she had heard from the lips of her companions how their husbands had proved false she felt that he was an exception and fervently thanked god that she had been so blessed
when gertrude retired to her bed that night the sad scene of the day followed her
the beauty of isabella with her flowing curls and the look of the child so much resembling the man whom she so dearly loved could not be forgotten and little clotelle's exclamation of papa
papa rang in her ears during the whole night
the return of henry at twelve o'clock did not increase her happiness
feeling his guilt he had absented himself from the house since his return from the ride
chapter xi  today a mistress tomorrow a slave  the night was dark the rain descended in torrents from the black and overhanging clouds and the thunder accompanied with vivid flashes of lightning resounded fearfully as henry linwood stepped from his chaise and entered isabella's cottage
more than a fortnight had elapsed since the accidental meeting and isabella was in doubt as to who the lady was that henry was with in the carriage
little however did she think that it was his wife
with a smile isabella met the young man as he entered her little dwelling
clotelle had already gone to bed but her father's voice roused her from her sleep and she was soon sitting on his knee
the pale and agitated countenance of henry betrayed his uneasiness but isabella's mild and laughing allusion to the incident of their meeting him on the day of his pleasuredrive and her saying i presume dear henry that the lady was one of your relatives led him to believe that she was still in ignorance of his marriage
she was in fact ignorant who the lady was who accompanied the man she loved on that eventful day
he aware of this now acted more like himself and passed the thing off as a joke
at heart however isabella felt uneasy and this uneasiness would at times show itself to the young man
at last and with a great effort she said  now dear henry if i am in the way of your future happiness say so and i will release you from any promises that you have made me
i know there is no law by which i can hold you and if there was i would not resort to it
you are as dear to me as ever and my thoughts shall always be devoted to you
it would be a great sacrifice for me to give you up to another but if it be your desire as great as the sacrifice is i will make it
send me and your child into a free state if we are in your way
again and again linwood assured her that no woman possessed his love but her
oh what falsehood and deceit man can put on when dealing with woman's love
the unabated storm kept henry from returning home until after the clock had struck two and as he drew near his residence he saw his wife standing at the window
giving his horse in charge of the servant who was waiting he entered the house and found his wife in tears
although he had never satisfied gertrude as to who the quadroon woman and child were he had kept her comparatively easy by his close attention to her and by telling her that she was mistaken in regard to the child's calling him papa
his absence that night however without any apparent cause had again aroused the jealousy of gertrude but henry told her that he had been caught in the rain while out which prevented his sooner returning and she anxious to believe him received the story as satisfactory
somewhat heated with brandy and wearied with much loss of sleep linwood fell into a sound slumber as soon as he retired
not so with gertrude
that faithfulness which has ever distinguished her sex and the anxiety with which she watched all his movements kept the wife awake while the husband slept
his sleep though apparently sound was nevertheless uneasy
again and again she heard him pronounce the name of isabella and more than once she heard him say i am not married i will never marry while you live
then he would speak the name of clotelle and say my dear child how i love you
after a sleepless night gertrude arose from her couch resolved that she would reveal the whole matter to her mother
mrs miller was a woman of little or no feeling proud peevish and passionate thus making everybody miserable that came near her and when she disliked any one her hatred knew no bounds
this gertrude knew and had she not considered it her duty she would have kept the secret locked in her own heart
during the day mrs linwood visited her mother and told her all that had happened
the mother scolded the daughter for not having informed her sooner and immediately determined to find out who the woman and child were that gertrude had met on the day of her ride
three days were spent by mrs miller in this endeavor but without success
four weeks had elapsed and the storm of the old lady's temper had somewhat subsided when one evening as she was approaching her daughter's residence she saw henry walking in the direction of where the quadroon was supposed to reside
feeling satisfied that the young man had not seen her the old women at once resolved to follow him
linwood's boots squeaked so loudly that mrs miller had no difficulty in following him without being herself observed
after a walk of about two miles the young man turned into a narrow and unfrequented road and soon entered the cottage occupied by isabella
it was a fine starlight night and the moon was just rising when they got to their journey's end
as usual isabella met henry with a smile and expressed her fears regarding his health
hours passed and still old mrs miller remained near the house determined to know who lived there
when she undertook to ferret out anything she bent her whole energies to it
as michael angelo who subjected all things to his pursuit and the idea he had formed of it painted the crucifixion by the side of a writhing slave and would have broken up the true cross for pencils so mrs miller would have entered the sepulchre if she could have done it in search of an object she wished to find
the full moon had risen and was pouring its beams upon surrounding objects as henry stepped from isabella's door and looking at his watch said  i must go dear it is now halfpast ten
had little clotelle been awake she too would have been at the door
as henry walked to the gate isabella followed with her left hand locked in his
again he looked at his watch and said i must go
it is more than a year since you staid all night murmured isabella as he folded her convulsively in his arms and pressed upon her beautiful lips a parting kiss
he was nearly out of sight when with bitter sobs the quadroon retraced her steps to the door of the cottage
clotelle had in the mean time awoke and now inquired of her mother how long her father had been gone
at that instant a knock was heard at the door and supposing that it was henry returning for something he had forgotten as he frequently did isabella flew to let him in
to her amazement however a strange woman stood in the door
who are you that comes here at this late hour
demanded the halffrightened isabella
without making any reply mrs miller pushed the quadroon aside and entered the house
what do you want here
again demanded isabella
i am in search of you thundered the maddened mrs miller but thinking that her object would be better served by seeming to be kind she assumed a different tone of voice and began talking in a pleasing manner
in this way she succeeded in finding out the connection existing between linwood and isabella and after getting all she could out of the unsuspecting woman she informed her that the man she so fondly loved had been married for more than two years
seized with dizziness the poor heartbroken woman fainted and fell upon the floor
how long she remained there she could not tell but when she returned to consciousness the strange woman was gone and her child was standing by her side
when she was so far recovered as to regain her feet isabella went to the door and even into the yard to see if the old woman was not somewhere about
as she stood there the full moon cast its bright rays over her whole person giving her an angelic appearance and imparting to her flowing hair a still more golden hue
suddenly another change came over her features and her full red lips trembled as with suppressed emotion
the muscles around her faultless mouth became convulsed she gasped for breath and exclaiming is it possible that man can be so false
again fainted
clotelle stood and bathed her mother's temples with cold water until she once more revived
although the laws of virginia forbid the education of slaves agnes had nevertheless employed an old free negro to teach her two daughters to read and write
after being separated from her mother and sister isabella turned her attention to the subject of christianity and received that consolation from the bible which is never denied to the children of god
this was now her last hope for her heart was torn with grief and filled with all the bitterness of disappointment
the night passed away but without sleep to poor isabella
at the dawn of day she tried to make herself believe that the whole of the past night was a dream and determined to be satisfied with the explanation which henry should give on his next visit
chapter xii  the motherinlaw
when henry returned home he found his wife seated at the window awaiting his approach
secret grief was gnawing at her heart
her sad pale cheeks and swollen eyes showed too well that agony far deeper than her speech portrayed filled her heart
a dull and deathlike silence prevailed on his entrance
his pale face and brow dishevelled hair and the feeling that he manifested on finding gertrude still up told henry in plainer words than she could have used that his wife was aware that her love had never been held sacred by him
the windowblinds were still unclosed and the fullorbed moon shed her soft refulgence over the unrivalled scene and gave it a silvery lustre which sweetly harmonized with the silence of the night
the clock's iron tongue in a neighboring belfry proclaimed the hour of twelve as the truant and unfaithful husband seated himself by the side of his devoted and loving wife and inquired if she was not well
i am dear henry replied gertrude but i fear you are not
if well in body i fear you are not at peace in mind
why
inquired he
because she replied you are so pale and have such a wild look in your eyes
again he protested his innocence and vowed she was the only woman who had any claim upon his heart
to behold one thus playing upon the feelings of two lovely women is enough to make us feel that evil must at last bring its own punishment
henry and gertrude had scarcely risen from the breakfasttable next morning ere old mrs miller made her appearance
she immediately took her daughter aside and informed her of her previous night's experience telling her how she had followed henry to isabella's cottage detailing the interview with the quadroon and her late return home alone
the old woman urged her daughter to demand that the quadroon and her child be at once sold to the negro speculators and taken out of the state or that gertrude herself should separate from henry
assert your rights my dear
let no one share a heart that justly belongs to you said mrs miller with her eyes flashing fire
don't sleep this night my child until that wench has been removed from that cottage and as for the child hand that over to mei saw at once that it was henry's
during these remarks the old lady was walking up and down the room like a caged lioness
she had learned from isabella that she had been purchased by henry and the innocence of the injured quadroon caused her to acknowledge that he was the father of her child
few women could have taken such a matter in hand and carried it through with more determination and success than old mrs miller
completely inured in all the crimes and atrocities connected with the institution of slavery she was also aware that to a greater or less extent the slave women shared with their mistress the affections of their master
this caused her to look with a suspicious eye on every goodlooking negro woman that she saw
while the old woman was thus lecturing her daughter upon her rights and duties henry unaware of what was transpiring had left the house and gone to his office
as soon as the old woman found that he was gone she said  i will venture anything that he is on his way to see that wench again
i'll lay my life on it
the entrance however of little marcus or mark as he was familiarly called asking for massa linwood's blue bag satisfied her that her soninlaw was at his office
before the old lady returned home it was agreed that gertrude should come to her mother's to tea that evening and henry with her and that mrs miller should there charge the young husband with inconstancy to her daughter and demand the removal of isabella
with this understanding the old woman retraced her steps to her own dwelling
had mrs miller been of a different character and not surrounded by slavery she could scarcely have been unhappy in such a home as hers
just at the edge of the city and sheltered by large poplartrees was the old homestead in which she resided
there was a splendid orchard in the rear of the house and the old weatherbeaten sweep with the mosscovered bucket at its end swung majestically over the deep well
the garden was scarcely to be equalled
its grounds were laid out in excellent taste and rare exotics in the greenhouse made it still more lovely
it was a sweet autumn evening when the air breathed through the fragrant sheaves of grain and the setting sun with his golden kisses burnished the rich clusters of purple grapes that henry and gertrude were seen approaching the house on foot it was nothing more than a pleasant walk
oh how gertrude's heart beat as she seated herself on their arrival
the beautiful parlor surrounded on all sides with luxury and taste with the sun creeping through the damask curtains added a charm to the scene
it was in this room that gertrude had been introduced to henry and the pleasant hours that she had spent there with him rushed unbidden on her memory
it was here that in former days her beautiful countenance had made her appearance as fascinating and as lovely as that of cleopatra's
her sweet musical voice might have been heard in every part of the house occasionally thrilling you with an unexpected touch
how changed the scene
her pale and wasted features could not be lighted up by any thoughts of the past and she was sorrowful at heart
as usual the servants in the kitchen were in ecstasies at the announcement that miss gerty as they called their young mistress was in the house for they loved her sincerely
gertrude had saved them from many a flogging by interceding for them when her mother was in one of her uncontrollable passions
dinah the cook always expected miss gerty to visit the kitchen as soon as she came and was not a little displeased on this occasion at what she considered her young mistress's neglect
uncle tony too looked regularly for miss gerty to visit the green house and congratulate him on his superiority as a gardener
when tea was over mrs miller dismissed the servants from the room then told her soninlaw what she had witnessed the previous night and demanded for her daughter that isabella should be immediately sent out of the state and to be sure that the thing would be done she wanted him to give her the power to make such disposition of the woman and child as she should think best
gertrude was mrs miller's only child and henry felt little like displeasing a family upon whose friendship he so much depended and no doubt long wishing to free himself from isabella he at once yielded to the demands of his motherinlaw
mr miller was a mere cipher about his premises
if any one came on business connected with the farm he would invariably say wait tin i see my wife and the wife's opinion was sure to be law in every case
bankrupt in character and debauched in body and mind with seven mulatto children who claimed him as their father he was badly prepared to find fault with his soninlaw
it was settled that mrs miller should use her own discretion in removing isabella from her little cottage and her future disposition
with this understanding henry and gertrude returned home
in the deep recesses of his heart the young man felt that he would like to see his child and its mother once more but fearing the wrath of his motherinlaw he did not dare to gratify his inclination
he had not the slightest idea of what would become of them but he well knew that the old woman would have no mercy on them
chapter xiii  a hardhearted woman
with no one but her dear little clotelle isabella passed her weary hours without partaking of either food or drink hoping that henry would soon return and that the strange meeting with the old woman would be cleared up
while seated in her neat little bedroom with her fevered face buried in her handkerchief the child ran in and told its mother that a carriage had stopped in front of the house
with a palpitating heart she arose from her seat and went to the door hoping that it was henry but to her great consternation the old lady who had paid her such an unceremonious visit on the evening that she had last seen henry stepped out of the carriage accompanied by the slavetrader jennings
isabella had seen the trader when he purchased her mother and sister and immediately recognized him
what could these persons want there
thought she
without any parleying or word of explanation the two entered the house leaving the carriage in charge of a servant
clotelle ran to her mother and clung to her dress as if frightened by the strangers
she's a finelooking wench said the speculator as he seated himself unasked in the rockingchair yet i don't think she is worth the money you ask for her
what do you want here
inquired isabella with a quivering voice
none of your insolence to me bawled out the old woman at the top of her voice if you do i will give you what you deserve so much my ladya good whipping
in an agony of grief pale trembling and ready to sink to the floor isabella was only sustained by the hope that she would be able to save her child
at last regaining her selfpossession she ordered them both to leave the house
feeling herself insulted the old woman seized the tongs that stood by the fireplace and raised them to strike the quadroon down but the slavetrader immediately jumped between the women exclaiming  i won't buy her mrs miller if you injure her
poor little clotelle screamed as she saw the strange woman raise the tongs at her mother
with the exception of old aunt nancy a free colored woman whom isabella sometimes employed to work for her the child had never before seen a strange face in her mother's dwelling
fearing that isabella would offer some resistance mrs miller had ordered the overseer of her own farm to follow her and just as jennings had stepped between the two women mull the negrodriver walked into the room
seize that impudent hussy said mrs miller to the overseer and tie her up this minute that i may teach her a lesson she won't forget in a hurry
as she spoke the old woman's eyes rolled her lips quivered and she looked like a very fury
i will have nothing to do with her if you whip her mrs miller said the slavetrader
niggers ain't worth half so much in the market with their backs newly scarred continued he as the overseer commenced his preparations for executing mrs miller's orders
clotelle here took her father's walkingstick which was lying on the back of the sofa where he had left it and raising it said  if you bad people touch my mother i will strike you
they looked at the child with astonishment and her extreme youth wonderful beauty and uncommon courage seemed for a moment to shake their purpose
the manner and language of this child were alike beyond her years and under other circumstances would have gained for her the approbation of those present
oh henry henry
exclaimed isabella wringing her hands
you need not call on him hussy you will never see him again said mrs miller
what
is he dead
inquired the heartstricken woman
it was then that she forgot her own situation thinking only of the man she loved
never having been called to endure any kind of abusive treatment isabella was not fitted to sustain herself against the brutality of mrs miller much less the combined ferociousness of the old woman and the overseer too
suffice it to say that instead of whipping isabella mrs miller transferred her to the negrospeculator who took her immediately to his slavepen
the unfeeling old woman would not permit isabella to take more than a single change of her clothing remarking to jennings  i sold you the wench you knownot her clothes
the injured friendless and unprotected isabella fainted as she saw her child struggling to release herself from the arms of old mrs miller and as the wretch boxed the poor child's ears
after leaving directions as to how isabella's furniture and other effects should be disposed of mrs miller took clotelle into her carriage and drove home
there was not even color enough about the child to make it appear that a single drop of african blood flowed through its blue veins
considerable sensation was created in the kitchen among the servants when the carriage drove up and clotelle entered the house
jes' like massa henry fur all de worl said dinah as she caught a glimpse of the child through the window
wondah whose brat dat ar' dat missis bringin' home wid her
said jane as she put the ice in the pitchers for dinner
i warrant it's some poor white nigger somebody bin givin' her
the child was white
what should be done to make it look like other negroes was the question which mrs miller asked herself
the calloushearted old woman bit her nether lip as she viewed that child standing before her with her long dark ringlets clustering over her alabaster brow and neck
take this little nigger and cut her hair close to her head said the mistress to jane as the latter answered the bell
clotelle screamed as she felt the scissors going over her head and saw those curls that her mother thought so much of falling upon the floor
a roar of laughter burst from the servants as jane led the child through the kitchen with the hair cut so short that the naked scalp could be plainly seen
gins to look like nigger now said dinah with her mouth upon a grin
the mistress smiled as the shorn child reentered the room but there was something more needed
the child was white and that was a great objection
however she hit upon a plan to remedy this which seemed feasible
the day was excessively warm
not a single cloud floated over the blue vault of heaven not a breath of wind seemed moving and the earth was parched by the broiling sun
even the bees had stopped humming and the butterflies had hid themselves under the broad leaves of the burdock
without a morsel of dinner the poor child was put in the garden and set to weeding it her arms neck and head completely bare
unaccustomed to toil clotelle wept as she exerted herself in pulling up the weeds
old dinah the cook was as unfeeling as her mistress and she was pleased to see the child made to work in the hot sun
dat white nigger 'll soon be black enuff if missis keeps her workin' out dar she said as she wiped the perspiration from her sooty brow
dinah was the mother of thirteen children all of whom had been taken from her when young and this no doubt did much to harden her feelings and make her hate all white persons
the burning sun poured its rays on the face of the friendless child until she sank down in the corner of the garden and was actually broiled to sleep
dat little nigger ain't workin' a bit missus said dinah to mrs miller as the latter entered the kitchen
she's lying in the sun seasoning she will work the better by and by replied the mistress
dese white niggers always tink dey seff good as white folks said the cook
yes but we will teach them better won't we dinah
rejoined mrs miller
yes missus replied dinah i don't like dese merlatter niggers no how
dey always want to set dey seff up for sumfin' big
with this remark the old cook gave one of her coarse laughs and continued missis understands human nature don't she
ah
ef she ain't a whole team and de ole gray mare to boot den dinah don't know nuffin'
of course the mistress was out of the kitchen before these last marks were made
it was with the deepest humiliation that henry learned from one of his own slaves the treatment which his child was receiving at the hands of his relentless motherinlaw
the scorching sun had the desired effect for in less than a fortnight clotelle could scarcely have been recognized as the same child
often was she seen to weep and heard to call on her mother
mrs miller when at church on sabbath usually on warm days took nancy one of her servants in her pew and this girl had to fan her mistress during service
unaccustomed to such a soft and pleasant seat the servant would very soon become sleepy and begin to nod
sometimes she would go fast asleep which annoyed the mistress exceedingly
but mrs miller had nimble fingers and on them sharp nails and with an energetic pinch upon the bare arms of the poor girl she would arouse the daughter of africa from her pleasant dreams
but there was no one of mrs miller's servants who received as much punishment as old uncle tony
fond of her greenhouse and often in the garden she was ever at the gardener's heels
uncle tony was very religious and whenever his mistress flogged him he invariably gave her a religious exhortation
although unable to read he nevertheless had on his tongue's end portions of scripture which he could use at any moment
in one end of the greenhouse was uncle tony's sleeping room and those who happened in that vicinity between nine and ten at night could hear the old man offering up his thanksgiving to god for his protection during the day
uncle tony however took great pride when he thought that any of the whites were within hearing to dwell in his prayer on his own goodness and the unfitness of others to die
often was he heard to say o lord thou knowest that the white folks are not christians but the black people are god's own children
but if tony thought that his old mistress was within the sound of his voice he launched out into deeper waters
it was therefore on a sweet night when the bright stars were looking out with a joyous sheen that mark and two of the other boys passed the greenhouse and heard uncle tony in his devotions
let's have a little fun said the mischievous marcus to his young companions
i will make uncle tony believe that i am old mistress and he'll give us an extra touch in his prayer
mark immediately commenced talking in a strain of voice resembling as well as he could mrs miller and at once tony was heard to say in a loud voice o lord thou knowest that the white people are not fit to die but as for old tony whenever the angel of the lord comes he's ready
at that moment mark tapped lightly on the door
who's dar
thundered old tony
mark made no reply
the old man commenced and went through with the same remarks addressed to the lord when mark again knocked at the door
who dat dar
asked uncle tony with a somewhat agitated countenance and trembling voice
still mark would not reply
again tony took up the thread of his discourse and said o lord thou knowest as well as i do that dese white folks are not prepared to die but here is old tony when de angel of de lord comes he's ready to go to heaven
mark once more knocked at the door
who dat dar
thundered tony at the top of his voice
de angel of de lord replied mark in a somewhat suppressed and sepulchral voice
what de angel of de lord want here
inquired tony as if much frightened
he's come for poor old tony to take him out of the world replied mark in the same strange voice
dat nigger ain't here he die tree weeks ago responded tony in a still more agitated and frightened tone
mark and his companions made the welkin ring with their shouts at the old man's answer
uncle tony hearing them and finding that he had been imposed upon opened his door came out with stick in hand and said is dat you mr mark
you imp if i can get to you i'll larn you how to come here wid your nonsense
mark and his companions left the garden feeling satisfied that uncle tony was not as ready to go with de angel of de lord as he would have others believe
chapter xiv  the prison
while poor little clotelle was being kicked about by mrs miller on account of her relationship to her soninlaw isabella was passing lonely hours in the county jail the place to which jennings had removed her for safekeeping after purchasing her from mrs miller
incarcerated in one of the ironbarred rooms of that dismal place those dark glowing eyes lofty brow and graceful form wilted down like a plucked rose under a noonday sun while deep in her heart's ambrosial cells was the most anguishing distress
vulgar curiosity is always in search of its victims and jennings' boast that he had such a ladylike and beautiful woman in his possession brought numbers to the prison who begged of the jailer the privilege of seeing the slavetrader's prize
many who saw her were melted to tears at the pitiful sight and were struck with admiration at her intelligence and when she spoke of her child they must have been convinced that a mother's sorrow can be conceived by none but a mother's heart
the warbling of birds in the green bowers of bliss which she occasionally heard brought no tidings of gladness to her
their joy fell cold upon her heart and seemed like bitter mockery
they reminded her of her own cottage where with her beloved child she had spent so many happy days
the speculator had kept close watch over his valuable piece of property for fear that it might damage itself
this however there was no danger of for isabella still hoped and believed that henry would come to her rescue
she could not bring herself to believe that he would allow her to be sent away without at least seeing her and the trader did all he could to keep this idea alive in her
while isabella with a weary heart was passing sleepless nights thinking only of her daughter and henry the latter was seeking relief in that insidious enemy of the human race the intoxicating cup
his wife did all in her power to make his life a pleasant and a happy one for gertrude was devotedly attached to him but a weary heart gets no gladness out of sunshine
the secret remorse that rankled in his bosom caused him to see all the world bloodshot
he had not visited his motherinlaw since the evening he had given her liberty to use her own discretion as to how isabella and her child should be disposed of
he feared even to go near the house for he did not wish to see his child
gertrude felt this every time he declined accompanying her to her mother's
possessed of a tender and confiding heart entirely unlike her mother she sympathized deeply with her husband
she well knew that all young men in the south to a greater or less extent became enamored of the slavewomen and she fancied that his case was only one of the many and if he had now forsaken all others for her she did not wish for him to be punished but she dared not let her mother know that such were her feelings
again and again had she noticed the great resemblance between clotelle and henry and she wished the child in better hands than those of her cruel mother
at last gertrude determined to mention the matter to her husband
consequently the next morning when they were seated on the back piazza and the sun was pouring its splendid rays upon everything around changing the red tints on the lofty hills in the distance into streaks of purest gold and nature seeming by her smiles to favor the object she said  what dear henry do you intend to do with clotelle
a paleness that overspread his countenance the tears that trickled down his cheeks the deep emotion that was visible in his face and the trembling of his voice showed at once that she had touched a tender chord
without a single word he buried his face in his handkerchief and burst into tears
this made gertrude still more unhappy for she feared that he had misunderstood her and she immediately expressed her regret that she had mentioned the subject
becoming satisfied from this that his wife sympathized with him in his unhappy situation henry told her of the agony that filled his soul and gertrude agreed to intercede for him with her mother for the removal of the child to a boardingschool in one of the free states
in the afternoon when henry returned from his office his wife met him with tearful eyes and informed him that her mother was filled with rage at the mere mention of the removal of clotelle from her premises
in the mean time the slavetrader jennings had started for the south with his gang of human cattle of whom isabella was one
most quadroon women who are taken to the south are either sold to gentlemen for their own use or disposed of as houseservants or waitingmaids
fortunately for isabella she was sold for the latter purpose
jennings found a purchaser for her in the person of mr james french
mrs french was a severe mistress
all who lived with her though welldressed were scantily fed and overworked
isabella found her new situation far different from her virginia cottagelife
she had frequently heard vicksburg spoken of as a cruel place for slaves and now she was in a position to test the truthfulness of the assertion
a few weeks after her arrival mrs french began to show to isabella that she was anything but a pleasant and agreeable mistress
what social virtues are possible in a society of which injustice is a primary characteristicin a society which is divided into two classes masters and slaves
every married woman at the south looks upon her husband as unfaithful and regards every negro woman as a rival
isabella had been with her new mistress but a short time when she was ordered to cut off her long and beautiful hair
the negro is naturally fond of dress and outward display
he who has short woolly hair combs and oils it to death he who has long hair would sooner have his teeth drawn than to part with it
but however painful it was to isabella she was soon seen with her hair cut short and the sleeves of her dress altered to fit tight to her arms
even with her hair short and with her illlooking dress isabella was still handsome
her life had been a secluded one and though now twentyeight years of age her beauty had only assumed a quieter tone
the other servants only laughed at isabella's misfortune in losing her beautiful hair
miss 'bell needn't strut so big she got short nappy har's well's i said nell with a broad grin that showed her teeth
she tink she white when she cum here wid dat long har ob hers replied mill
yes continued nell missus make her take down her wool so she no put it up today
the fairness of isabella's complexion was regarded with envy by the servants as well as by the mistress herself
this is one of the hard features of slavery
today a woman is mistress of her own cottage tomorrow she is sold to one who aims to make her life as intolerable as possible
and let it be remembered that the houseservant has the best situation a slave can occupy
but the degradation and harsh treatment isabella experienced in her new home was nothing compared to the grief she underwent at being separated from her dear child
taken from her with scarcely a moment's warning she knew not what had become of her
this deep and heartfelt grief of isabella was soon perceived by her owners and fearing that her refusal to take proper food would cause her death they resolved to sell her
mr french found no difficulty in securing a purchaser for the quadroon woman for such are usually the most marketable kind of property
isabella was sold at private sale to a young man for a housekeeper but even he had missed his aim
mr gordon the new master was a man of pleasure
he was the owner of a large sugar plantation which he had left under the charge of an overseer and was now giving himself up to the pleasures of a city life
at first mr gordon sought to win isabella's favor by flattery and presents knowing that whatever he gave her he could take from her again
the poor innocent creature dreaded every moment lest the scene should change
at every interview with gordon she stoutly maintained that she had left a husband in virginia and could never think of taking another
in this she considered that she was truthful for she had ever regarded henry as her husband
the gold watch and chain and other glittering presents which gordon gave to her were all kept unused
in the same house with isabella was a manservant who had from time to time hired himself from his master
his name was william
he could feel for isabella for he like her had been separated from near and dear relatives and he often tried to console the poor woman
one day isabella observed to him that her hair was growing out again
yes replied william you look a good deal like a man with your short hair
oh rejoined she i have often been told that i would make a better looking man than woman and if i had the money i might avail myself of it to bid farewell to this place
in a moment afterwards isabella feared that she had said too much and laughingly observed i am always talking some nonsense you must not heed me
william was a tall fullblooded african whose countenance beamed with intelligence
being a mechanic he had by industry earned more money than he had paid to his owner for his time and this he had laid aside with the hope that he might some day get enough to purchase his freedom
he had in his chest about a hundred and fifty dollars
his was a heart that felt for others and he had again and again wiped the tears from his eyes while listening to isabella's story
if she can get free with a little money why not give her what i have
thought he and then resolved to do it
an hour after he entered the quadroon's room and laying the money in her lap said  there miss isabella you said just now that if you had the means you would leave this place
there is money enough to take you to england where you will be free
you are much fairer than many of the white women of the south and can easily pass for a free white woman
at first isabella thought it was a plan by which the negro wished to try her fidelity to her owner but she was soon convinced by his earnest manner and the deep feeling he manifested that he was entirely sincere
i will take the money said she only on one condition and that is that i effect your escape as well as my own
how can that be done
he inquired eagerly
i will assume the disguise of a gentleman and you that of a servant and we will thus take passage in a steamer to cincinnati and from thence to canada
with full confidence in isabella's judgment william consented at once to the proposition
the clothes were purchased everything was arranged and the next night while mr gordon was on one of his sprees isabella under the assumed name of mr smith with william in attendance as a servant took passage for cincinnati in the steamer heroine
with a pair of green glasses over her eyes in addition to her other disguise isabella made quite a gentlemanly appearance
to avoid conversation however she kept closely to her stateroom under the plea of illness
meanwhile william was playing his part well with the servants
he was loudly talking of his master's wealth and nothing on the boat appeared so good as in his master's fine mansion
i don't like dese steamboats no how said he i hope when massa goes on anoder journey he take de carriage and de hosses
after a ninedays' passage the heroine landed at cincinnati and mr smith and his servant walked on shore
william you are now a free man and can go on to canada said isabella i shall go to virginia in search of my daughter
this sudden announcement fell heavily upon william's ears and with tears he besought her not to jeopardize her liberty in such a manner but isabella had made up her mind to rescue her child if possible
taking a boat for wheeling isabella was soon on her way to her native state
several months had elapsed since she left richmond and all her thoughts were centred on the fate of her dear clotelle
it was with a palpitating heart that this injured woman entered the stagecoach at wheeling and set out for richmond
chapter xv  the arrest
it was late in the evening when the coach arrived at richmond and isabella once more alighted in her native city
she had intended to seek lodgings somewhere in the outskirts of the town but the lateness of the hour compelled her to stop at one of the principal hotels for the night
she had scarcely entered the inn before she recognized among the numerous black servants one to whom she was well known and her only hope was that her disguise would keep her from being discovered
the imperturbable calm and entire forgetfulness of self which induced isabella to visit a place from which she could scarcely hope to escape to attempt the rescue of a beloved child demonstrate that overwillingness of woman to carry out the promptings of the finer feelings of the heart
true to woman's nature she had risked her own liberty for another's
she remained in the hotel during the night and the next morning under the plea of illness took her breakfast alone
that day the fugitive slave paid a visit to the suburbs of the town and once more beheld the cottage in which she had spent so many happy hours
it was winter and the clematis and passionflower were not there but there were the same walks her feet had so often pressed and the same trees which had so often shaded her as she passed through the garden at the back of the house
old remembrances rushed upon her memory and caused her to shed tears freely
isabella was now in her native town and near her daughter but how could she communicate with her
how could she see her
to have made herself known would have been a suicidal act betrayal would have followed and she arrested
three days passed away and still she remained in the hotel at which she had first put up and yet she got no tidings of her child
unfortunately for isabella a disturbance had just broken out among the slave population in the state of virginia and all strangers were treated with suspicion
the insurrection to which we now refer was headed by a fullblooded negro who had been born and brought up a slave
he had heard the crack of the driver's whip and seen the warm blood streaming from the negro's body
he had witnessed the separation of parents from children and was made aware by too many proofs that the slave could expect no justice from the hands of the slaveowner
the name of this man was nat turner
he was a preacher amongst the negroes distinguished for his eloquence respected by the whites loved and venerated by the negroes
on the discovery of the plan for the outbreak turner fled to the swamps followed by those who had joined in the insurrection
here the revolted negroes numbered some hundreds and for a time bade defiance to their oppressors
the dismal swamps cover many thousand acres of wild land and a dense forest with wild animals and insects such as are unknown in any other part of virginia
here runaway negroes usually seek a hidingplace and some have been known to reside here for years
the revolters were joined by one of these
he was a large tall fullblooded negro with a stern and savage countenance the marks on his face showed that he was from one of the barbarous tribes in africa and claimed that country as his native land
his only covering was a girdle around his loins made of skins of wild beasts which he had killed
his only token of authority among those that he led was a pair of epaulettes made of the tail of a fox and tied to his shoulder by a cord
brought from the coast of africa when only fifteen years of age to the island of cuba he was smuggled from thence into virginia
he had been two years in the swamps and considered it his future home
he had met a negro woman who was also a runaway and after the fashion of his native land had gone through the process of oiling her as the marriage ceremony
they had built a cave on a rising mound in the swamp and this was their home
this man's name was picquilo
his only weapon was a sword made from a scythe which he had stolen from a neighboring plantation
his dress his character his manners and his mode of fighting were all in keeping with the early training he had received in the land of his birth
he moved about with the activity of a cat and neither the thickness of the trees nor the depth of the water could stop him
his was a bold turbulent spirit and from motives of revenge he imbrued his hands in the blood of all the whites he could meet
hunger thirst and loss of sleep he seemed made to endure as if by peculiarity of constitution
his air was fierce his step oblique his look sanguinary
such was the character of one of the negroes in the southampton insurrection
all negroes were arrested who were found beyond their master's threshold and all white strangers were looked upon with suspicion
such was the position in which isabella found affairs when she returned to virginia in search of her child
had not the slaveowners been watchful of strangers owing to the outbreak the fugitive could not have escaped the vigilance of the police for advertisements announcing her escape and offering a large reward for her arrest had been received in the city previous to her arrival and officers were therefore on the lookout for her
it was on the third day after her arrival in richmond as the quadroon was seated in her room at the hotel still in the disguise of a gentleman that two of the city officers entered the apartment and informed her that they were authorized to examine all strangers to assure the authorities that they were not in league with the revolted negroes
with trembling heart the fugitive handed the key of her trunk to the officers
to their surprise they found nothing but female apparel in the trunk which raised their curiosity and caused a further investigation that resulted in the arrest of isabella as a fugitive slave
she was immediately conveyed to prison there to await the orders of her master
for many days uncheered by the voice of kindness alone hopeless desolate she waited for the time to arrive when the chains should be placed on her limbs and she returned to her inhuman and unfeeling owner
the arrest of the fugitive was announced in all the newspapers but created little or no sensation
the inhabitants were too much engaged in putting down the revolt among the slaves and although all the odds were against the insurgents the whites found it no easy matter with all their caution
every day brought news of fresh outbreaks
without scruple and without pity the whites massacred all blacks found beyond the limits of their owners' plantations
the negroes in return set fire to houses and put to death those who attempted to escape from the flames
thus carnage was added to carnage and the blood of the whites flowed to avenge the blood of the blacks
these were the ravages of slavery
no graves were dug for the negroes but their bodies became food for dogs and vultures and their bones partly calcined by the sun remained scattered about as if to mark the mournful fury of servitude and lust of power
when the slaves were subdued except a few in the swamps bloodhounds were employed to hunt out the remaining revolters
chapter xvi  death is freedom
on receiving intelligence of the arrest of isabella mr gordon authorized the sheriff to sell her to the highest bidder
she was therefore sold the purchaser being the noted negrotrader hope h slater who at once placed her in prison
here the fugitive saw none but slaves like herself brought in and taken out to be placed in ships and sent away to some part of the country to which she herself would soon be compelled to go
she had seen or heard nothing of her daughter while in richmond and all hopes of seeing her had now fled
at the dusk of the evening previous to the day when she was to be sent off as the old prison was being closed for the night isabella suddenly darted past the keeper and ran for her life
it was not a great distance from the prison to the long bridge which passes from the lower part of the city across the potomac to the extensive forests and woodlands of the celebrated arlington heights then occupied by that distinguished relative and descendant of the immortal washington mr geo
w custis
thither the poor fugitive directed her flight
so unexpected was her escape that she had gained several rods the start before the keeper had secured the other prisoners and rallied his assistants to aid in the pursuit
it was at an hour and in a part of the city where horses could not easily be obtained for the chase no bloodhounds were at hand to run down the flying woman and for once it seemed as if there was to be a fair trial of speed and endurance between the slave and the slavecatchers
the keeper and his force raised the hueandcry on her path as they followed close behind but so rapid was the flight along the wide avenue that the astonished citizens as they poured forth from their dwellings to learn the cause of alarm were only able to comprehend the nature of the case in time to fall in with the motley throng in pursuit or raise an anxious prayer to heaven as they refused to join in the chase as many a one did that night that the panting fugitive might escape and the merciless souldealer for once be disappointed of his prey
and now with the speed of an arrow having passed the avenue with the distance between her and her pursuers constantly increasing this poor hunted female gained the long bridge as it is called where interruption seemed improbable
already her heart began to beat high with the hope of success
she had only to pass threequarters of a mile across the bridge when she could bury herself in a vast forest just at the time when the curtain of night would close around her and protect her from the pursuit of her enemies
but god by his providence had otherwise determined
he had ordained that an appalling tragedy should be enacted that night within plain sight of the president's house and the capitol of the union which would be an evidence wherever it should be known of the unconquerable love of liberty which the human heart may inherit as well as a fresh admonition to the slavedealer of the cruelty and enormity of his crimes
just as the pursuers passed the high draw soon after entering upon the bridge they beheld three men slowly approaching from the virginia side
they immediately called to them to arrest the fugitive proclaiming her a runaway slave
true to their virginia instincts as she came near they formed a line across the narrow bridge to intercept her
seeing that escape was impossible in that quarter she stopped suddenly and turned upon her pursuers
on came the profane and ribald crew faster than ever already exulting in her capture and threatening punishment for her flight
for a moment she looked wildly and anxiously around to see if there was no hope of escape
on either hand far down below rolled the deep foaming waters of the potomac and before and behind were the rapidly approaching steps and noisy voices of her pursuers
seeing how vain would be any further effort to escape her resolution was instantly taken
she clasped her hands convulsively together raised her tearful and imploring eyes toward heaven and begged for the mercy and compassion there which was unjustly denied her on earth then exclaiming henry clotelle i die for thee
with a single bound vaulted over the railing of the bridge and sank forever beneath the angry and foaming waters of the river
such was the life and such the death of a woman whose virtues and goodness of heart would have done honor to one in a higher station of life and who had she been born in any other land but that of slavery would have been respected and beloved
what would have been her feelings if she could have known that the child for whose rescue she had sacrificed herself would one day be free honored and loved in another land
chapter xvii  clotelle
the curtain rises seven years after the death of isabella
during that interval henry finding that nothing could induce his motherinlaw to relinquish her hold on poor little clotelle and not liking to contend with one on whom a future fortune depended gradually lost all interest in the child and left her to her fate
although mrs miller treated clotelle with a degree of harshness scarcely equalled when applied to one so tender in years still the child grew every day more beautiful and her hair though kept closely cut seemed to have improved in its soft silklike appearance
now twelve years of age and more than usually welldeveloped her harsh old mistress began to view her with a jealous eye
henry and gertrude had just returned from washington where the husband had been on his duties as a member of congress and where he had remained during the preceding three years without returning home
it was on a beautiful evening just at twilight while seated at his parlor window that henry saw a young woman pass by and go into the kitchen
not aware of ever having seen the person before he made an errand into the cook's department to see who the girl was
he however met her in the hall as she was about going out
whom did you wish to see
he inquired
miss gertrude was the reply
what did you want to see her for
he again asked
my mistress told me to give her and master henry her compliments and ask them to come over and spend the evening
who is your mistress
he eagerly inquired
mrs miller sir responded the girl
and what's your name
asked henry with a trembling voice
clotelle sir was the reply
the astonished father stood completely amazed looking at the now womanly form of her who in his happier days he had taken on his knee with so much fondness and alacrity
it was then that he saw his own and isabella's features combined in the beautiful face that he was then beholding
it was then that he was carried back to the days when with a woman's devotion poor isabella hung about his neck and told him how lonely were the hours in his absence
he could stand it no longer
tears rushed to his eyes and turning upon his heel he went back to his own room
it was then that isabella was revenged and she no doubt looked smilingly down from her home in the spiritland on the scene below
on gertrude's return from her shopping tour she found henry in a melancholy mood and soon learned its cause
as gertrude had borne him no children it was but natural that he should now feel his love centering in clotelle and he now intimated to his wife his determination to remove his daughter from the hands of his motherinlaw
when this news reached mrs miller through her daughter she became furious with rage and calling clotelle into her room stripped her shoulders bare and flogged her in the presence of gertrude
it was nearly a week after the poor girl had been so severely whipped and for no cause whatever that her father learned of the circumstance through one of the servants
with a degree of boldness unusual for him he immediately went to his motherinlaw and demanded his child
but it was too lateshe was gone
to what place she had been sent no one could tell and mrs miller refused to give any information whatever relative to the girl
it was then that linwood felt deepest the evil of the institution under which he was living for he knew that his daughter would be exposed to all the vices prevalent in that part of the country where marriage is not recognized in connection with that class
chapter xviii  a slavehunting parson
it was a delightful evening after a cloudless day with the setting sun reflecting his golden rays on the surrounding hills which were covered with a beautiful greensward and the luxuriant verdure that forms the constant garb of the tropics that the steamer columbia ran into the dock at natchez and began unloading the cargo taking in passengers and making ready to proceed on her voyage to new orleans
the plank connecting the boat with the shore had scarcely been secured in its place when a goodlooking man about fifty years of age with a white necktie and a pair of goldrimmed glasses on was seen hurrying on board the vessel
just at that moment could be seen a stout man with his face pitted with the smallpox making his way up to the abovementioned gentleman
how do you do my dear sir
this is mr wilson i believe said the short man at the same time taking from his mouth a large chew of tobacco and throwing it down on the ship's deck
you have the advantage of me sir replied the tall man
why don't you know me
my name is jennings i sold you a splendid negro woman some years ago
yes yes answered the natchez man
i remember you now for the woman died in a few months and i never got the worth of my money out of her
i could not help that returned the slavetrader she was as sound as a roach when i sold her to you
oh yes replied the parson i know she was but now i want a young girl fit for house useone that will do to wait on a lady
i am your man said jennings just follow me continued he and i will show you the fairest little critter you ever saw
and the two passed to the stern of the boat to where the trader had between fifty and sixty slaves the greater portion being women
there said jennings as a beautiful young woman shrunk back with modesty
there sir is the very gal that was made for you
if she had been made to your order she could not have suited you better
indeed sir is not that young woman white
inquired the parson
oh no sir she is no whiter than you see
but is she a slave
asked the preacher
yes said the trader i bought her in richmond and she comes from an excellent family
she was raised by squire miller and her mistress was one of the most pious ladies in that city i may say she was the salt of the earth as the ministers say
but she resembles in some respect agnes the woman i bought from you said mr wilson
as he said the name of agnes the young woman started as if she had been struck
her pulse seemed to quicken but her face alternately flushed and turned pale and tears trembled upon her eyelids
it was a name she had heard her mother mention and it brought to her memory those daysthose happy days when she was so loved and caressed
this young woman was clotelle the granddaughter of agnes
the preacher on learning the fact purchased her and took her home feeling that his daughter georgiana would prize her very highly
clotelle found in georgiana more a sister than a mistress who unknown to her father taught the slavegirl how to read and did much toward improving and refining clotelle's manners for her own sake
like her mother fond of flowers the virginia maid as she was sometimes called spent many of her leisure hours in the garden
beside the flowers which sprang up from the fertility of soil unplanted and unattended there was the heliotrope sweetpea and cuprose transplanted from the island of cuba
in her new home clotelle found herself saluted on all sides by the fragrance of the magnolia
when she went with her young mistress to the poplar farm as she sometimes did nature's wild luxuriance greeted her wherever she cast her eyes
the rustling citron lime and orange shady mango with its fruits of gold and the palmetto's umbrageous beauty all welcomed the child of sorrow
when at the farm huckelby the overseer kept his eye on clotelle if within sight of her for he knew she was a slave and no doubt hoped that she might some day fall into his hands
but she shrank from his looks as she would have done from the charm of the rattlesnake
the negrodriver always tried to insinuate himself into the good opinion of georgiana and the company that she brought
knowing that miss wilson at heart hated slavery he was ever trying to show that the slaves under his charge were happy and contented
one day when georgiana and some of her connecticut friends were there the overseer called all the slaves up to the great house and set some of the young ones to dancing
after awhile whiskey was brought in and a dram given to each slave in return for which they were expected to give a toast or sing a short piece of his own composition when it came to jack's turn he said  the big bee flies high the little bee makes the honey the black folks make the cotton and the white folks gets the money
of course the overseer was not at all elated with the sentiment contained in jack's toast
mr wilson had lately purchased a young man to assist about the house and to act as coachman
this slave whose name was jerome was of pure african origin was perfectly black very finelooking tall slim and erect as any one could possibly be
his features were not bad lips thin nose prominent hands and feet small
his brilliant black eyes lighted up his whole countenance
his hair which was nearly straight hung in curls upon his lofty brow
george combe or fowler would have selected his head for a model
he was brave and daring strong in person fiery in spirit yet kind and true in his affections earnest in his doctrines
clotelle had been at the parson's but a few weeks when it was observed that a mutual feeling had grown up between her and jerome
as time rolled on they became more and more attached to each other
after satisfying herself that these two really loved georgiana advised their marriage
but jerome contemplated his escape at some future day and therefore feared that if married it might militate against it
he hoped also to be able to get clotelle away too and it was this hope that kept him from trying to escape by himself
dante did not more love his beatrice swift his stella waller his saccharissa goldsmith his jessamy bride or bums his mary than did jerome his clotelle
unknown to her father miss wilson could permit these two slaves to enjoy more privileges than any of the other servants
the young mistress taught clotelle and the latter imparted her instructions to her lover until both could read so as to be well understood
jerome felt his superiority and always declared that no master should ever flog him
aware of his high spirit and determination clotelle was in constant fear lest some difficulty might arise between her lover and his master
one day mr wilson being somewhat out of temper and irritated at what he was pleased to call jerome's insolence ordered him to follow him to the barn to be flogged
the young slave obeyed his master but those who saw him at the moment felt that he would not submit to be whipped
no sir replied jerome as his master told him to take off his coat i will serve you master wilson i will labor for you day and night if you demand it but i will not be whipped
this was too much for a white man to stand from a negro and the preacher seized his slave by the throat intending to choke him
but for once he found his match
jerome knocked him down and then escaped through the backyard to the street and from thence to the woods
recovering somewhat from the effect of his fall the parson regained his feet and started in pursuit of the fugitive
finding however that the slave was beyond his reach he at once resolved to put the dogs on his track
tabor the negrocatcher was sent for and in less than an hour eight or ten men including the parson were in the woods with hounds trying the trails
these dogs will attack a negro at their master's bidding and cling to him as the bulldog will cling to a beast
many are the speculations as to whether the negro will be secured alive or dead when these dogs once get on his track
whenever there is to be a negro hunt there is no lack of participants
many go to enjoy the fun which it is said they derive from these scenes
the company had been in the woods but a short time ere they got on the track of two fugitives one of whom was jerome
the slaves immediately bent their steps toward the swamp with the hope that the dogs when put upon their scent would be unable to follow them through the water
the slaves then took a straight course for the baton rouge and bayou sara road about four miles distant
nearer and nearer the whimpering pack pressed on their delusion begins to dispel
all at once the truth flashes upon the minds of the fugitives like a glare of light'tis tabor with his dogs
the scent becomes warmer and warmer and what was at first an irregular cry now deepens into one ceaseless roar as the relentless pack presses on after its human prey
they at last reach the river and in the negroes plunge followed by the catchdog
jerome is caught and is once more in the hands of his master while the other poor fellow finds a watery grave
they return and the preacher sends his slave to jail
chapter xix  the true heroine
in vain did georgiana try to console clotelle when the latter heard through one of the other slaves that mr wilson had started with the dogs in pursuit of jerome
the poor girl well knew that he would be caught and that severe punishment if not death would be the result of his capture
it was therefore with a heart filled with the deepest grief that the slavegirl heard the footsteps of her master on his return from the chase
the dogged and stern manner of the preacher forbade even his daughter inquiring as to the success of his pursuit
georgiana secretly hoped that the fugitive had not been caught she wished it for the sake of the slave and more especially for her maidservant whom she regarded more as a companion than a menial
but the news of the capture of jerome soon spread through the parson's household and found its way to the ears of the weeping and heartstricken clotelle
the reverend gentleman had not been home more than an hour ere come of his parishioners called to know if they should not take the negro from the prison and execute lynch law upon him
no negro should be permitted to live after striking a white man let us take him and hang him at once remarked an elderlylooking man whose gray hairs thinly covered the crown of his head
i think the deacon is right said another of the company if our slaves are allowed to set the will of their masters at defiance there will be no getting along with theman insurrection will be the next thing we hear of
no no said the preacher i am willing to let the law take its course as it provides for the punishment of a slave with death if he strikes his master
we had better let the court decide the question
moreover as a christian and godfearing people we ought to submit to the dictates of justice
should we take this man's life by force an allwise providence would hold us responsible for the act
the company then quietly withdrew showing that the preacher had some influence with his people
this said mr wilson when left alone with his daughterthis my dear georgiana is the result of your kindness to the negroes
you have spoiled every one about the house
i can't whip one of them without being in danger of having my life taken
i am sure papa replied the young ladyi am sure i never did any thing intentionally to induce any of the servants to disobey your orders
no my dear said mr wilson but you are too kind to them
now there is clotellethat girl is completely spoiled
she walks about the house with as dignified an air as if she was mistress of the premises
by and by you will be sorry for this foolishness of yours
but answered georgiana clotelle has a superior mind and god intended her to hold a higher position in life than that of a servant
yes my dear and it was your letting her know that she was intended for a better station in society that is spoiling her
always keep a negro in ignorance of what you conceive to be his abilities returned the parson
it was late on the saturday afternoon following the capture of jerome that while mr wilson was seated in his study preparing his sermon for the next day georgiana entered the room and asked in an excited tone if it were true that jerome was to be hanged on the following thursday
the minister informed her that such was the decision of the court
then said she clotelle will die of grief
what business has she to die of grief
returned the father his eyes at the moment flashing fire
she has neither eaten nor slept since he was captured replied georgians and i am certain that she will not live through this
i cannot be disturbed now said the parson i must get my sermon ready for tomorrow
i expect to have some strangers to preach to and must therefore prepare a sermon that will do me credit
while the man of god spoke he seemed to say to himself  with devotion's visage and pious actions we do sugar over the devil himself
georgiana did all in her power to soothe the feelings of clotelle and to induce her to put her trust in god
unknown to her father she allowed the poor girl to go every evening to the jail to see jerome and during these visits despite her own grief clotelle would try to comfort her lover with the hope that justice would be meted out to him in the spiritland
thus the time passed on and the day was fast approaching when the slave was to die
having heard that some secret meeting had been held by the negroes previous to the attempt of mr wilson to flog his slave it occurred to a magistrate that jerome might know something of the intended revolt
he accordingly visited the prison to see if he could learn anything from him but all to no purpose
having given up all hopes of escape jerome had resolved to die like a brave man
when questioned as to whether he knew anything of a conspiracy among the slaves against their masters he replied  do you suppose that i would tell you if i did
but if you know anything remarked the magistrate and will tell us you may possibly have your life spared
life answered the doomed man is worth nought to a slave
what right has a slave to himself his wife or his children
we are kept in heathenish darkness by laws especially enacted to make our instruction a criminal offence and our bones sinews blood and nerves are exposed in the market for sale
my liberty is of as much consequence to me as mr wilson's is to him
i am as sensitive to feeling as he
if i mistake not the day will come when the negro will learn that he can get his freedom by fighting for it and should that time arrive the whites will be sorry that they have hated us so shamefully
i am free to say that could i live my life over again i would use all the energies which god has given me to get up an insurrection
every one present seemed startled and amazed at the intelligence with which this descendant of africa spoke
he's a very dangerous man remarked one
yes said another he got some booklearning somewhere and that has spoiled him
an effort was then made to learn from jerome where he had learned to read but the black refused to give any information on the subject
the sun was just going down behind the trees as clotelle entered the prison to see jerome for the last time
he was to die on the next day her face was bent upon her hands and the gushing tears were forcing their way through her fingers
with beating heart and trembling hands evincing the deepest emotion she threw her arms around her lover's neck and embraced him
but prompted by her heart's unchanging love she had in her own mind a plan by which she hoped to effect the escape of him to whom she had pledged her heart and hand
while the overcharged clouds which had hung over the city during the day broke and the rain fell in torrents amid the most terrific thunder and lightning clotelle revealed to jerome her plan for his escape
dress yourself in my clothes said she and you can easily pass the jailer
this jerome at first declined doing
he did not wish to place a confiding girl in a position where in all probability she would have to suffer but being assured by the young girl that her life would not be in danger he resolved to make the attempt
clotelle being very tall it was not probable that the jailer would discover any difference in them
at this moment she took from her pocket a bunch of keys and unfastened the padlock and freed him from the floor
come girl it is time for you to go said the jailer as jerome was holding the almost fainting girl by the hand
being already attired in clotelle's clothes the disguised man embraced the weeping girl put his handkerchief to his face and passed out of the jail without the keeper's knowing that his prisoner was escaping in a disguise and under cover of the night
chapter xx  the hero of many adventures
jerome had scarcely passed the prisongates ere he reproached himself for having taken such a step
there seemed to him no hope of escape out of the state and what was a few hours or days at most of life to him when by obtaining it another had been sacrificed
he was on the eve of returning when he thought of the last words uttered by clotelle
be brave and determined and you will still be free
the words sounded like a charm in his ears and he went boldly forward
clotelle had provided a suit of men's clothes and had placed them where her lover could get them if he should succeed in getting out
returning to mr wilson's barn the fugitive changed his apparel and again retraced his steps into the street
to reach the free states by travelling by night and lying by during the day from a state so far south as mississippi no one would think for a moment of attempting to escape
to remain in the city would be a suicidal step
the deep sound of the escape of steam from a boat which was at that moment ascending the river broke upon the ears of the slave
if that boat is going up the river said he why not i conceal myself on board and try to escape
he went at once to the steamboat landing where the boat was just coming in
bound for louisville said the captain to one who was making inquiries
as the passengers were rushing on board jerome followed them and proceeding to where some of the hands were stowing away bales of goods he took hold and aided them
jump down into the hold there and help the men said the mate to the fugitive supposing that like many persons he was working his way up the river
once in the hull among the boxes the slave concealed himself
weary hours and at last days passed without either water or food with the hidden slave
more than once did he resolve to let his case be known but the knowledge that he would be sent back to natchez kept him from doing so
at last with lips parched and fevered to a crisp the poor man crawled out into the freightroom and began wandering about
the hatches were on and the room dark
there happened to be on board a wedding party and a box containing some of the bridal cake with several bottles of port wine was near jerome
he found the box opened it and helped himself
in eight days the boat tied up at the wharf at the place of her destination
it was late at night the boat's crew with the single exception of the man on watch were on shore
the hatches were off and the fugitive quietly made his way on deck and jumped on shore
the man saw the fugitive but too late to seize him
still in a slave state jerome was at a loss to know how he should proceed
he had with him a few dollars enough to pay his way to canada if he could find a conveyance
the fugitive procured such food as he wanted from one of the many eatinghouses and then following the direction of the north star he passed out of the city and took the road leading to covington
keeping near the ohio river jerome soon found an opportunity to cross over into the state of indiana
but liberty was a mere name in the latter state and the fugitive learned from some colored persons that he met that it was not safe to travel by daylight
while making his way one night with nothing to cheer him but the prospect of freedom in the future he was pounced upon by three men who were lying in wait for another fugitive an advertisement of whom they had received through the mail
in vain did jerome tell them that he was not a slave
true they had not caught the man they expected but if they could make this slave tell from what place he had escaped they knew that a good price would be paid them for the negro's arrest
tortured by the slavecatchers to make him reveal the name of his master and the place from whence he had escaped jerome gave them a fictitious name in virginia and said that his master would give a large reward and manifested a willingness to return to his old boss
by this misrepresentation the fugitive hoped to have another chance of getting away
allured with the prospect of a large sum of the needful the slavecatchers started back with their victim
stopping on the second night at an inn on the banks of the ohio river the kidnappers in lieu of a suitable place in which to confine their prize during the night chained him to the bedpost of their sleepingchamber
the white men were late in retiring to rest after an evening spent in drinking
at dead of night when all was still the slave arose from the floor upon which he had been lying looked around and saw that morpheus had possession of his captors
for once thought he the brandy bottle has done a noble work
with palpitating heart and trembling limbs he viewed his position
the door was fast but the warm weather had compelled them to leave the window open
if he could but get his chains off he might escape through the window to the piazza
the sleepers' clothes hung upon chairs by the bedside
the slave thought of the padlockkey examined the pockets and found it
the chains were soon off and the negro stealthily making his way to the window
he stopped and said to himself these men are villains they are enemies to all who like me are trying to be free
then why not i teach them a lesson
he then dressed himself in the best suit hung his own wornout and tattered garments on the same chair and silently passed through the window to the piazza and let himself down by one of the pillars and started once more for the north
daylight came upon the fugitive before he had selected a hidingplace for the day and he was walking at a rapid rate in hopes of soon reaching some woodland or forest
the sun had just begun to show itself when the fugitive was astounded at seeing behind him in the distance two men upon horseback
taking a road to the right the slave saw before him a farmhouse and so near was he to it that he observed two men in front of it looking at him
it was too late to turn back
the kidnappers were behind himstrange men before him
those in the rear he knew to be enemies while he had no idea of what principles were the farmers
the latter also saw the white men coming and called to the fugitive to come that way
the broadbrimmed hats that the farmers wore told the slave that they were quakers
jerome had seen some of these people passing up and down the river when employed on a steamer between natchez and new orleans and had heard that they disliked slavery
he therefore hastened toward the drabcoated men who on his approach opened the barndoor and told him to run in
when jerome entered the barn the two farmers closed the door remaining outside themselves to confront the slavecatchers who now came up and demanded admission feeling that they had their prey secure
thee can't enter my premises said one of the friends in rather a musical voice
the negrocatchers urged their claim to the slave and intimated that unless they were allowed to secure him they would force their way in
by this time several other quakers had gathered around the barndoor
unfortunately for the kidnappers and most fortunately for the fugitive the friends had just been holding a quarterly meeting in the neighborhood and a number of them had not yet returned to their homes
after some talk the men in drab promised to admit the hunters provided they procured an officer and a searchwarrant from a justice of the peace
one of the slavecatchers was left to see that the fugitive did not get away while the others went in pursuit of an officer
in the mean time the owner of the barn sent for a hammer and nails and began nailing up the barndoor
after an hour in search of the man of the law they returned with an officer and a warrant
the quaker demanded to see the paper and after looking at it for some time called to his son to go into the house for his glasses
it was a long time before aunt ruth found the leather case and when she did the glasses wanted wiping before they could be used
after comfortably adjusting them on his nose he read the warrant over leisurely
come mr dugdale we can't wait all day' said the officer
well will thee read it for me
returned the quaker
the officer complied and the man in drab said  yes thee may go in now
i am inclined to throw no obstacles in the way of the execution of the law of the land
on approaching the door the men found some forty or fifty nails in it in the way of their progress
lend me your hammer and a chisel if you please mr dugdale said the officer
please read that paper over again will thee
asked the quaker
the officer once more read the warrant
i see nothing there which says i must furnish thee with tools to open my door
if thee wants a hammer thee must go elsewhere for it i tell thee plainly thee can't have mine
the implements for opening the door are at length obtained and after another halfhour the slavecatchers are in the barn
three hours is a long time for a slave to be in the hands of quakers
the hay is turned over and the barn is visited in every part but still the runaway is not found
uncle joseph has a glow upon his countenance ephraim shakes his head knowingly little elijah is a perfect knownothing and if you look toward the house you will see aunt ruth's smiling face ready to announce that breakfast is ready
the nigger is not in this barn said the officer
i know he is not quietly answered the quaker
what were you nailing up your door for then as if you were afraid we would enter
inquired one of the kidnappers
i can do what i please with my own door can't i said the quaker
the secret was out the fugitive had gone in at the front door and out at the back and the reading of the warrant nailing up of the door and other preliminaries of the quaker was to give the fugitive time and opportunity to escape
it was now late in the morning and the slavecatchers were a long way from home and the horses were jaded by the rapid manner in which they had travelled
the friends in high glee returned to the house for breakfast the man of the law after taking his fee went home and the kidnappers turned back muttering better luck next time
chapter xxi  selfsacrifice
now in her seventeenth year clotelle's personal appearance presented a great contrast to the time when she lived with old mrs miller
her tall and welldeveloped figure her long silky black hair falling in curls down her swanlike neck her bright black eyes lighting up her olivetinted face and a set of teeth that a tuscarora might envy she was a picture of tropicalripened beauty
at times there was a heavenly smile upon her countenance which would have warmed the heart of an anchorite
such was the personal appearance of the girl who was now in prison by her own act to save the life of another
would she be hanged in his stead or would she receive a different kind of punishment
these questions clotelle did not ask herself
open frank free and generous to a fault she always thought of others never of her own welfare
the long stay of clotelle caused some uneasiness to miss wilson yet she dared not tell her father for he had forbidden the slavegirl's going to the prison to see her lover
while the clock on the church near by was striking eleven georgiana called sam and sent him to the prison in search of clotelle
the girl went away from here at eight o'clock was the jailer's answer to the servant's inquiries
the return of sam without having found the girl saddened the heart of the young mistress
sure then said she the poor heartbroken thing has made way with herself
still she waited till morning before breaking the news of clotelle's absence to her father
the jailer discovered the next morning to his utter astonishment that his prisoner was white instead of black and his first impression was that the change of complexion had taken place during the night through fear of death
but this conjecture was soon dissipated for the dark glowing eyes the sable curls upon the lofty brow and the mild sweet voice that answered his questions informed him that the prisoner before him was another being
on learning in the morning that clotelle was in jail dressed in male attire miss wilson immediately sent clothes to her to make a change in her attire
news of the heroic and daring act of the slavegirl spread through the city with electric speed
i will sell every nigger on the place said the parson at the breakfasttablei will sell them all and get a new lot and whip them every day
poor georgiana wept for the safety of clotelle while she felt glad that jerome had escaped
in vain did they try to extort from the girl the whereabouts of the man whose escape she had effected
she was not aware that he had fled on a steamer and when questioned she replied  i don't know and if i did i would not tell you
i care not what you do with me if jerome but escapes
the smile with which she uttered these words finely illustrated the poet's meaning when he says  a fearful gift upon thy heart is laid womanthe power to suffer and to love
her sweet simplicity seemed to dare them to lay their rough hands amid her trembling curls
three days did the heroic young woman remain in prison to be gazed at by an unfeeling crowd drawn there out of curiosity
the intelligence came to her at last that the court had decided to spare her life on condition that she should be whipped sold and sent out of the state within twentyfour hours
this order of the court she would have cared but little for had she not been sincerely attached to her young mistress
do try and sell her to some one who will use her well said georgiana to her father as he was about taking his hat to leave the house
i shall not trouble myself to do any such thing replied the hardhearted parson
i leave the finding of a master for her with the slavedealer
bathed in tears miss
wilson paced her room in the absence of her father
for many months georgiana had been in a decline and any little trouble would lay her on a sick bed for days
she was therefore poorly able to bear the loss of this companion whom she so dearly loved
mr wilson had informed his daughter that clotelle was to be flogged and when felice came in and informed her mistress that the poor girl had just received fifty lashes on her bare person the young lady fainted and fell on the floor
the servants placed their mistress on the sofa and went in pursuit of their master
little did the preacher think on returning to his daughter that he should soon be bereft of her yet such was to be his lot
a bloodvessel had been ruptured and the three physicians who were called in told the father that he must prepare to lose his child
that moral courage and calmness which was her great characteristic did not forsake georgiana in her hour of death
she had ever been kind to the slaves under her charge and they loved and respected her
at her request the servants were all brought into her room and took a last farewell of their mistress
seldom if ever was there witnessed a more touching scene than this
there lay the young woman pale and feeble with death stamped upon her countenance surrounded by the sons and daughters of africa some of whom had been separated from every earthly tie and the most of whose persons had been torn and gashed by the negrowhip
some were upon their knees at the bedside others standing around and all weeping
death is a leveler and neither age sex wealth nor condition can avert when he is permitted to strike
the most beautiful flowers must soon fade and droop and die
so also with man his days are as uncertain as the passing breeze
this hour he glows in the blush of health and vigor but the next he may be counted with the number no more known on earth
oh what a silence pervaded the house when this young flower was gone
in the midst of the buoyancy of youth this cherished one had drooped and died
deep were the sounds of grief and mourning heard in that stately dwelling when the stricken friends whose office it had been to nurse and soothe the weary sufferer beheld her pale and motionless in the sleep of death
who can imagine the feeling with which poor clotelle received the intelligence of her kind friend's death
the deep gashes of the cruel whip had prostrated the lovely form of the quadroon and she lay upon her bed of straw in the dark cell
the speculator had bought her but had postponed her removal till she should recover
her benefactress was dead and  hope withering fled and mercy sighed farewell
is jerome safe
she would ask herself continually
if her lover could have but known of the sufferings of that sweet flowerthat polyanthus over which he had so often been in his dreamshe would then have learned that she was worthy of his love
it was more than a fortnight before the slavetrader could take his prize to more comfortable quarters
like alcibiades who defaced the images of the gods and expected to be pardoned on the ground of eccentricity so men who abuse god's image hope to escape the vengeance of his wrath under the plea that the law sanctions their atrocious deeds
chapter xxii  love at first sight and what followed
it was a beautiful sunday in september with a cloudless sky and the rays of the sun parching the already thirsty earth that clotelle stood at an upper window in slater's slavepen in new orleans gasping for a breath of fresh air
the bells of thirty churches were calling the people to the different places of worship
crowds were seen wending their way to the houses of god one followed by a negro boy carrying his master's bible another followed by her maidservant holding the mistress' fan a third supporting an umbrella over his master's head to shield him from the burning sun
baptists immersed presbyterians sprinkled methodists shouted and episcopalians read their prayers while ministers of the various sects preached that christ died for all
the chiming of the bells seemed to mock the sighs and deep groans of the forty human beings then incarcerated in the slavepen
these imprisoned children of god were many of them methodists some baptists and others claiming to believe in the faith of the presbyterians and episcopalians
oh with what anxiety did these creatures await the close of that sabbath and the dawn of another day that should deliver them from those dismal and close cells
slowly the day passed away and once more the evening breeze found its way through the barred windows of the prison that contained these injured sons and daughters of america
the clock on the calaboose had just struck nine on monday morning when hundreds of persons were seen threading the gates and doors of the negropen
it was the same gang that had the day previous been stepping to the tune and keeping time with the musical church bells
their bibles were not with them their prayerbooks were left at home and even their long and solemn faces had been laid aside for the week
they had come to the manmarket to make their purchases
methodists were in search of their brethren
baptists were looking for those that had been immersed while presbyterians were willing to buy fellow christians whether sprinkled or not
the crowd was soon gazing at and feasting their eyes upon the lovely features of clotelle
she is handsomer muttered one to himself than the lady that sat in the pew next to me yesterday
i would that my daughter was half so pretty thinks a second
groups are seen talking in every part of the vast building and the topic on 'change is the beautiful quadroon
by and by a tall young man with a foreign face the curling mustache protruding from under a finelychiseled nose and having the air of a gentleman passes by
his dark hazel eye is fastened on the maid and he stops for a moment the stranger walks away but soon returnshe looks he sees the young woman wipe away the silent tear that steals down her alabaster cheek he feels ashamed that he should gaze so unmanly on the blushing face of the woman
as he turns upon his heel he takes out his white hankerchief and wipes his eyes
it may be that he has lost a sister a mother or some dear one to whom he was betrothed
again he comes and the quadroon hides her face
she has heard that foreigners make bad masters and she shuns his piercing gaze
again he goes away and then returns
he takes a last look and then walks hurriedly off
the day wears away but long before the time of closing the sale the tall young man once more enters the slavepen
he looks in every direction for the beautiful slave but she is not thereshe has been sold
he goes to the trader and inquires but he is too late and he therefore returns to his hotel
having entered a military school in paris when quite young and soon after been sent with the french army to india antoine devenant had never dabbled in matters of love
he viewed all women from the same standpointrespected them for their virtues and often spoke of the goodness of heart of the sex but never dreamed of taking to himself a wife
the unequalled beauty of clotelle had dazzled his eyes and every look that she gave was a dagger that went to his heart
he felt a shortness of breath his heart palpitated his head grew dizzy and his limbs trembled but he knew not its cause
this was the first stage of love at first sight
he who bows to the shrine of beauty when beckoned by this mysterious agent seldom regrets it
devenant reproached himself for not having made inquiries concerning the girl before he left the market in the morning
his stay in the city was to be short and the yellow fever was raging which caused him to feel like making a still earlier departure
the disease appeared in a form unusually severe and repulsive
it seized its victims from amongst the most healthy of the citizens
the disorder began in the brain by oppressive pain accompanied or followed by fever
fiery veins streaked the eye the face was inflamed and dyed of a dark dull red color the ears from time to time rang painfully
now mucous secretions surcharged the tongue and took away the power of speech now the sick one spoke but in speaking had foresight of death
when the violence of the disease approached the heart the gums were blackened
the sleep broken troubled by convulsions or by frightful visions was worse than the waking hours and when the reason sank under a delirium which had its seat in the brain repose utterly forsook the patient's couch
the progress of the fever within was marked by yellowish spots which spread over the surface of the body
if then a happy crisis came not all hope was gone
soon the breath infected the air with a fetid odor the lips were glazed despair painted itself in the eyes and sobs with long intervals of silence formed the only language
from each side of the mouth spread foam tinged with black and burnt blood
blue streaks mingled with the yellow all over the frame
all remedies were useless
this was the yellow fever
the disorder spread alarm and confusion throughout the city
on an average more than four hundred died daily
in the midst of disorder and confusion death heaped victims on victims
friend followed friend in quick succession
the sick were avoided from the fear of contagion and for the same reason the dead were left unburied
nearly two thousand dead bodies lay uncovered in the burialground with only here and there a little lime thrown over them to prevent the air becoming infected
the negro whose home is in a hot climate was not proof against the disease
many plantations had to suspend their work for want of slaves to take the places of those who had been taken off by the fever
chapter xxiii  meeting of the cousins
the clock in the hall had scarcely finished striking three when mr taylor entered his own dwelling a fine residence in camp street new orleans followed by the slavegirl whom he had just purchased at the negropen
clotelle looked around wildly as she passed through the hall into the presence of her new mistress
mrs taylor was much pleased with her servant's appearance and congratulated her husband on his judicious choice
but said mrs taylor after clotelle had gone into the kitchen how much she looks like miss jane morton
indeed replied the husband i thought the moment i saw her that she looked like the mortons
i am sure i never saw two faces more alike in my life than that girl's and jane morton's continued mrs taylor
dr morton the purchaser of maron the youngest daughter of agnes and sister to isabella had resided in camp street near the taylors for more than eight years and the families were on very intimate terms and visited each other frequently
every one spoke of clotelle's close resemblance to the mortons and especially to the eldest daughter
indeed two sisters could hardly have been more alike
the large dark eyes black silklike hair tall graceful figure and mould of the face were the same
the morning following clotelle's arrival in her new home mrs taylor was conversing in a low tone with her husband and both with their eyes following clotelle as she passed through the room
she is far above the station of a slave remarked the lady
i saw her last night when removing some books open one and stand over it a moment as if she was reading and she is as white as i am
i almost sorry you bought her
at this juncture the front doorbell rang and clotelle hurried through the room to answer it
miss morton said the servant as she returned to the mistress' room
ask her to walk in responded the mistress
now my dear said mrs taylor to her husband just look and see if you do not notice a marked resemblance between the countenances of jane and clotelle
miss morton entered the room just as mrs taylor ceased speaking
have you heard that the jamisons are down with the fever
inquired the young lady after asking about the health of the taylors
no i had not i was in hopes it would not get into our street replied mrs taylor
all this while mr and mrs taylor were keenly scrutinizing their visitor and clotelle and even the two young women seemed to be conscious that they were in some way the objects of more than usual attention
miss morton had scarcely departed before mrs taylor began questioning clotelle concerning her early childhood and became more than ever satisfied that the slavegirl was in some way connected with the mortons
every hour brought fresh news of the ravages of the fever and the taylors commenced preparing to leave town
as mr taylor could not go at once it was determined that his wife should leave without him accompanied by her new maid servant
just as mrs taylor and clotelle were stepping into the carriage they were informed that dr morton was down with the epidemic
it was a beautiful day with a fine breeze for the time of year that mrs taylor and her servant found themselves in the cabin of the splendid new steamer walkinthewater bound from new orleans to mobile
every berth in the boat wad occupied by persons fleeing from the fearful contagion that was carrying off its hundreds daily
late in the day as clotelle was standing at one of the windows of the ladies' saloon she was astonished to see near her and with eyes fixed intently upon her the tall young stranger whom she had observed in the slavemarket a few days before
she turned hastily away but the heated cabin and the want of fresh air soon drove her again to the window
the young gentleman again appeared and coming to the end of the saloon spoke to the slavegirl in broken english
this confirmed her in her previous opinion that he was a foreigner and she rejoiced that she had not fallen into his hands
i want to talk with you said the stranger
what do you want with me
she inquired
i am your friend he answered
i saw you in the slavemarket last week and regretted that i did not speak to you then
i returned in the evening but you was gone
clotelle looked indignantly at the stranger and was about leaving the window again when the quivering of his lips and the trembling of his voice struck her attention and caused her to remain
i intended to buy you and make you free and happy but i was too late continued he
why do you wish to make me free
inquired the girl
because i once had an only and lovely sister who died three years ago in france and you are so much like her that had i not known of her death i should certainly have taken you for her
however much i may resemble your sister you are aware that i am not she why then take so much interest in one whom you have never seen before and may never see again
the love said he which i had for my sister is transferred to you
clotelle had all along suspected that the man was a knave and this profession of love at once confirmed her in that belief
she therefore immediately turned away and left him
hours elapsed
twilight was just letting down her curtain and pinning it with a star as the slavegirl seated herself on a sofa by the window and began meditating upon her eventful history meanwhile watching the white waves as they seemed to sport with each other in the wake of the noble vessel with the rising moon reflecting its silver rays upon the splendid scene when the foreigner once more appeared near the window
although agitated for fear her mistress would see her talking to a stranger and be angry clotelle still thought she saw something in the countenance of the young man that told her he was sincere and she did not wish to hurt his feelings
why persist in your wish to talk with me
she said as he again advanced and spoke to her
i wish to purchase you and make you happy returned he
but i am not for sale now she replied
my present mistress will not sell me and if you wished to do so ever so much you could not
then said he if i cannot buy you when the steamer reaches mobile fly with me and you shall be free
i cannot do it said clotelle and she was just leaving the stranger when he took from his pocket a piece of paper and thrust it into her hand
after returning to her room she unfolded the paper and found to her utter astonishment that it contained a one hundred dollar note on the bank of the united states
the first impulse of the girl was to return the paper and its contents immediately to the giver but examining the paper more closely she saw in faint pencilmarks remember this is from one who loves you
another thought was to give it to her mistress and she returned to the saloon for that purpose but on finding mrs taylor engaged in conversation with some ladies she did not deem it proper to interrupt her
again therefore clotelle seated herself by the window and again the stranger presented himself
she immediately took the paper from her pocket and handed it to him but he declined taking it saying  no keep it it may be of some service to you when i am far away
would that i could understand you said the slave
believe that i am sincere and then you will understand me returned the young man
would you rather be a slave than be free
inquired he with tears that glistened in the rays of the moon
no said she i want my freedom but i must live a virtuous life
then if you would be free and happy go with me
we shall be in mobile in two hours and when the passengers are going on shore you take my arm
have your face covered with a veil and you will not be observed
we will take passage immediately for france you can pass as my sister and i pledge you my honor that i will marry you as soon as we arrive in france
this solemn promise coupled with what had previously been said gave clotelle confidence in the man and she instantly determined to go with him
but then thought she what if i should be detected
i would be forever ruined for i would be sold and in all probability have to end my days on a cotton rice or sugar plantation
however the thought of freedom in the future outweighed this danger and her resolve was taken
dressing herself in some of her best clothes and placing her veiled bonnet where she could get it without the knowledge of her mistress clotelle awaited with a heart filled with the deepest emotions and anxiety the moment when she was to take a step which seemed so rash and which would either make or ruin her forever
the ships which leave mobile for europe lie about thirty miles down the bay and passengers are taken down from the city in small vessels
the walkinthewater had just made her lines fast and the passengers were hurrying on shore when a tall gentleman with a lady at his side descended the stageplank and stepped on the wharf
this was antoine devenant and clotelle
chapter xxiv  the law and its victim
the death of dr morton on the third day of his illness came like a shock upon his wife and daughters
the corpse had scarcely been committed to its mother earth before new and unforeseen difficulties appeared to them
by the laws of the slave states the children follow the condition of their mother
if the mother is free the children are free if a slave the children are slaves
being unacquainted with the southern code and no one presuming that marion had any negro blood in her veins dr morton had not given the subject a single thought
the woman whom he loved and regarded as his wife was after all nothing more than a slave by the laws of the state
what would have been his feelings had he known that at his death his wife and children would be considered as his property
yet such was the case
like most men of means at that time dr morton was deeply engaged in speculation and though generally considered wealthy was very much involved in his business affairs
after the disease with which dr morton had so suddenly died had to some extent subsided mr james morton a brother of the deceased went to new orleans to settle up the estate
on his arrival there he was pleased with and felt proud of his nieces and invited them to return with him to vermont little dreaming that his brother had married a slave and that his widow and daughters would be claimed as such
the girls themselves had never heard that their mother had been a slave and therefore knew nothing of the danger hanging over their heads
an inventory of the property of the deceased was made out by mr morton and placed in the hands of the creditors
these preliminaries being arranged the ladies with their relative concluded to leave the city and reside for a few days on the banks of lake ponchartrain where they could enjoy a fresh air that the city did not afford
as they were about taking the cars however an officer arrested the whole partythe ladies as slaves and the gentleman upon the charge of attempting to conceal the property of his deceased brother
mr morton was overwhelmed with horror at the idea of his nieces being claimed as slaves and asked for time that he might save them from such a fate
he even offered to mortgage his little farm in vermont for the amount which young slavewomen of their ages would fetch
but the creditors pleaded that they were an extra article and would sell for more than common slaves and must therefore be sold at auction
the uncle was therefore compelled to give them up to the officers of the law and they were separated from him
jane the oldest of the girls as we have before mentioned was very handsome bearing a close resemblance to her cousin clotelle
alreka though not as handsome as her sister was nevertheless a beautiful girl and both had all the accomplishments that wealth and station could procure
though only in her fifteenth year alreka had become strongly attached to volney lapie a young frenchman a student in her father's office
this attachment was reciprocated although the poverty of the young man and the extreme youth of the girl had caused their feelings to be kept from the young lady's parents
the day of sale came and mr morton attended with the hope that either the magnanimity of the creditors or his own little farm in vermont might save his nieces from the fate that awaited them
his hope however was in vain
the feelings of all present seemed to be lost in the general wish to become the possessor of the young ladies who stood trembling blushing and weeping as the numerous throng gazed at them or as the intended purchaser examined the graceful proportions of their fair and beautiful frames
neither the presence of the uncle nor young lapie could at all lessen the gross language of the officers or stay the rude hands of those who wished to examine the property thus offered for sale
after a fierce contest between the bidders the girls were sold one for two thousand three hundred and the other for two thousand three hundred and fifty dollars
had these girls been bought for servants only they would in all probability have brought not more than nine hundred or a thousand dollars each
here were two beautiful young girls accustomed to the fondest indulgence surrounded by all the refinements of life and with the timidity and gentleness which such a life would naturally produce bartered away like cattle in the markets of smithfield or new york
the mother who was also to have been sold happily followed her husband to the grave and was spared the pangs of a broken heart
the purchaser of the young ladies left the market in triumph and the uncle with a heavy heart started for his new england home with no earthly prospect of ever beholding his nieces again
the seizure of the young ladies as slaves was the result of the administrator's having found among dr morton's papers the billofsale of marion which he had taken when he purchased her
he had doubtless intended to liberate her when he married her but had neglected from time to time to have the proper papers made out
sad was the result of this negligence
chapter xxv  the flight
on once gaining the wharf devenant and clotelle found no difficulty in securing an immediate passage to france
the fine packetship utica lay down the bay and only awaited the return of the lighter that night to complete her cargo and list of passengers ere she departed
the young frenchman therefore took his prize on board and started for the ship
daylight was just making its appearance the next morning when the utica weighed anchor and turned her prow toward the sea
in the course of three hours the vessel with outspread sails was rapidly flying from land
everything appeared to be auspicious
the skies were beautifully clear and the sea calm with a sun that dazzled the whole scene
but clouds soon began to chase each other through the heavens and the sea became rough
it was then that clotelle felt that there was hope of escaping
she had hitherto kept in the cabin but now she expressed a wish to come on deck
the hanging clouds were narrowing the horizon to a span and gloomily mingling with the rising surges
the old and gravelooking seamen shook their weatherwise heads as if foretelling a storm
as clotelle came on deck she strained her eyes in vain to catch a farewell view of her native land
with a smile on her countenance but with her eyes filled with tears she said  farewell farewell to the land of my birth and welcome welcome ye dark blue waves
i care not where i go so it is    'where a tyrant never trod   where a slave was never known   but where nature worships god   if in the wilderness alone'
devenant stood by her side seeming proud of his future wife with his face in a glow at his success while over his noble brow clustering locks of glossy black hair were hanging in careless ringlets
his finelycut classic features wore the aspect of one possessed with a large and noble heart
once more the beautiful clotelle whispered in the ear of her lover    away away o'er land and sea   america is now no home for me
the winds increased with nightfall and impenetrable gloom surrounded the ship
the prospect was too uncheering even to persons in love
the attention which devenant paid to clotelle although she had been registered on the ship's passenger list as his sister caused more than one to look upon his as an agreeable travelling companion
his tall slender figure and fine countenance bespoke for him at first sight one's confidence
that he was sincerely and deeply enamored of clotelle all could see
the weather became still more squally
the wind rushed through the white foaming waves and the ship groaned with its own wild and ungovernable labors while nothing could be seen but the wild waste of waters
the scene was indeed one of fearful sublimity
day came and went without any abatement of the storm
despair was now on every countenance
occasionally a vivid flash of lightning would break forth and illuminate the black and boiling surges that surrounded the vessel which was now scudding before the blast under bare poles
after five days of most intensely stormy weather the sea settled down into a dead calm and the passengers flocked on deck
during the last three days of the storm clotelle had been so unwell as to be unable to raise her head
her pale face and quivering lips and languid appearance made her look as if every pulsation had ceased
her magnificent large and soft eyes fringed with lashes as dark as night gave her an angelic appearance
the unreserved attention of devenant even when seasick himself did much to increase the little love that the at first distrustful girl had placed in him
the heart must always have some object on which to centre its affections and clotelle having lost all hope of ever again seeing jerome it was but natural that she should now transfer her love to one who was so greatly befriending her
at first she respected devenant for the love he manifested for her and for his apparent willingness to make any sacrifice for her welfare
true this was an adventure upon which she had risked her all and should her heart be foiled in this search for hidden treasures her affections would be shipwrecked forever
she felt under great obligations to the man who had thus effected her escape and that noble act alone would entitle him to her love
each day became more pleasant as the noble ship sped onward amid the rippled spray
the whistling of the breeze through the rigging was music to the ear and brought gladness to the heart of every one on board
at last the long suspense was broken by the appearance of land at which all hearts leaped for joy
it was a beautiful morning in october
the sun had just risen and sky and earth were still bathed in his soft rosy glow when the utica hauled into the dock at bordeaux
the splendid streets beautiful bridges glittering equipages and smiling countenances of the people gave everything a happy appearance after a voyage of twentynine days on the deep deep sea
after getting their baggage cleared from the customhouse and going to a hotel devenant made immediate arrangements for the marriage
clotelle on arriving at the church where the ceremony was to take place was completely overwhelmed at the spectacle
she had never beheld a scene so gorgeous as this
the magnificent dresses of the priests and choristers the deep and solemn voices the elevated crucifix the burning tapers the splendidly decorated altar the sweetsmelling incense made the occasion truly an imposing one
at the conclusion of the ceremony the loud and solemn peals of the organ's swelling anthem were lost to all in the contemplation of the interesting scene
the happy couple set out at once for dunkirk the residence of the bridegroom's parents
but their stay there was short for they had scarcely commenced visiting the numerous friends of the husband ere orders came for him to proceed to india to join that portion of the french army then stationed there
in due course of time they left for india passing through paris and lyons taking ship at marseilles
in the metropolis of france they spent a week where the husband took delight in introducing his wife to his brother officers in the french army and where the newlymarried couple were introduced to louis phillippe then king of france
in all of these positions clotelle sustained herself in a most ladylike manner
at lyons they visited the vast factories and other public works and all was pleasure with them
the voyage from marseilles to calcutta was very pleasant as the weather was exceedingly fine
on arriving in india captain devenant and lady were received with honorsthe former for his heroic bravery in more than one battle and the latter for her fascinating beauty and pleasing manners and the fact that she was connected with one who was a general favorite with all who had his acquaintance
this was indeed a great change for clotelle
six months had not elapsed since her exposure in the slavemarket of new orleans
this life is a stage and we are indeed all actors
chapter xxvi  the hero of a night
mounted on a fast horse with the quaker's son for a guide jerome pressed forward while uncle joseph was detaining the slavecatchers at the barndoor through which the fugitive had just escaped
when out of present danger fearing that suspicion might be aroused if he continued on the road in open day jerome buried himself in a thick dark forest until nightfall
with a yearning heart he saw the splendor of the setting sun lingering on the hills as if loath to fade away and be lost in the more sombre hues of twilight which rising from the east was slowly stealing over the expanse of heaven bearing silence and repose which should cover his flight from a neighborhood to him so full of dangers
wearily and alone with nothing but the hope of safety before him to cheer him on his way the poor fugitive urged his tired and trembling limbs forward for several nights
the new suit of clothes with which he had provided himself when he made his escape from his captors and the twenty dollars which the young quaker had slipped into his hand when bidding him fare thee well would enable him to appear genteelly as soon as he dared to travel by daylight and would thus facilitate his progress toward freedom
it was late in the evening when the fugitive slave arrived at a small town on the banks of lake erie where he was to remain over night
how strange were his feelings
while his heart throbbed for that freedom and safety which canada alone could furnish to the whipscarred slave on the american continent his thoughts were with clotelle
was she still in prison and if so what would be her punishment for aiding him to escape from prison
would he ever behold her again
these were the thoughts that followed him to his pillow haunted him in is dreams and awakened him from his slumbers
the alarm of fire aroused the inmates of the hotel in which jerome had sought shelter for the night from the deep sleep into which they had fallen
the whole village was buried in slumber and the building was half consumed before the frightened inhabitants had reached the scene of the conflagration
the wind was high and the burning embers were wafted like so many rockets through the sky
the whole town was lighted up and the cries of women and children in the streets made the scene a terrific one
jerome heard the alarm and hastily dressing himself he went forth and hastened toward the burning building
therethere in that room in the second story is my child
exclaimed a woman wringing her hands and imploring some one to go to the rescue of her little one
the broad sheets of fire were flying in the direction of the chamber in which the child was sleeping and all hope of its being saved seemed gone
occasionally the wind would lift the pall of smoke and show that the work of destruction was not yet complete
at last a long ladder was brought and one end placed under the window of the room
a moment more and a bystander mounted the ladder and ascended in haste to the window
the smoke met him as he raised the sash and he cried out all is lost
and returned to the ground without entering the room
another sweep of the wind showed that the destroying element had not yet made its final visit to that part of the doomed building
the mother seeing that all hope of again meeting her child in this world was gone wrung her hands and seemed inconsolable with grief
at this juncture a man was seen to mount the ladder and ascend with great rapidity
all eyes were instantly turned to the figure of this unknown individual as it disappeared in the cloud of smoke escaping from the window
those who a moment before had been removing furniture as well as the idlers who had congregated at the ringing of the bells assembled at the foot of the ladder and awaited with breathless silence the reappearance of the stranger who regardless of his own safety had thus risked his life to save another's
three cheers broke the stillness that had fallen on the company as the brave man was seen coming through the window and slowly descending to the ground holding under one arm the inanimate form of the child
another cheer and then another made the welkin ring as the stranger with hair burned and eyebrows closely singed fainted at the foot of the ladder
but the child was saved
the stranger was jerome
as soon as he revived he shrunk from every eye as if he feared they would take from him the freedom which he had gone through so much to obtain
the next day the fugitive took a vessel and the following morning found himself standing on the free soil of canada
as his foot pressed the shore he threw himself upon his face kissed the earth and exclaimed o god
i thank thee that i am a free man
chapter xxvii  true freedom
the history of the african race is god's illuminated clock set in the dark steeple of time
the negro has been made the hewer of wood and the drawer of water for nearly all other nations
the people of the united states however will have an account to settle with god owing to their treatment of the negro which will far surpass the rest of mankind
jerome on reaching canada felt for the first time that personal freedom which god intended that all who bore his image should enjoy
that same forgetfulness of self which had always characterized him now caused him to think of others
the thoughts of dear ones in slavery were continually in his mind and above all others clotelle occupied his thoughts
now that he was free he could better appreciate her condition as a slave
although jerome met on his arrival in canada numbers who had escaped from the southern states he nevertheless shrank from all society particularly that of females
the soft silvergray tints on the leaves of the trees with their snowspotted trunks and a biting air warned the newborn freeman that he was in another climate
jerome sought work and soon found it and arranged with his employer that the latter should go to natchez in search of clotelle
the good scotchman for whom the fugitive was laboring freely offered to go down and purchase the girl if she could be bought and let jerome pay him in work
with such a prospect of future happiness in view this injured descendant of outraged and bleeding africa went daily to his toil with an energy hitherto unknown to him
but oh how vain are the hopes of man
chapter xxviii  farewell to america
three months had elapsed from the time the fugitive commenced work for mr streeter when that gentleman returned from his southern research and informed jerome that parson wilson had sold clotelle and that she had been sent to the new orleans slavemarket
this intelligence fell with crushing weight upon the heart of jerome and he now felt that the last chain which bound him to his native land was severed
he therefore determined to leave america forever
his nearest and dearest friends had often been flogged in his very presence and he had seen his mother sold to the negrotrader
an only sister had been torn from him by the souldriver he had himself been sold and resold and been compelled to submit to the most degrading and humiliating insults and now that the woman upon whom his heart doted and without whom life was a burden had been taken away forever he felt it a duty to hate all mankind
if there is one thing more than another calculated to make one hate and detest american slavery it is to witness the meetings between fugitives and their friends in canada
jerome had beheld some of these scenes
the wife who after years of separation had escaped from her prisonhouse and followed her husband had told her story to him
he had seen the newlyarrived wife rush into the arms of the husband whose dark face she had not looked upon for long weary years
some told of how a sister had been illused by the overseer others of a husband's being whipped to death for having attempted to protect his wife
he had sat in the little loghut by the fireside and heard tales that caused his heart to bleed and his bosom swelled with just indignation when he thought that there was no remedy for such atrocious acts
it was with such feelings that he informed his employer that he should leave him at the expiration of a month
in vain did mr streeter try to persuade jerome to remain with him and late in the month of february the latter found himself on board a small vessel loaded with pinelumber descending the st lawrence bound for liverpool
the bark though an old one was nevertheless considered seaworthy and the fugitive was working his way out
as the vessel left the river and gained the open sea the black man appeared to rejoice at the prospect of leaving a country in which his right to manhood had been denied him and his happiness destroyed
the wind was proudly swelling the white sails and the little craft plunging into the foaming waves with the land fast receding in the distance when jerome mounted a pile of lumber to take a last farewell of his native land
with tears glistening in his eyes and with quivering lips he turned his gaze toward the shores that were fast fading in the dim distance and said  though forced from my native land by the tyrants of the south i hope i shall some day be able to return
with all her faults i love my country still
chapter xxix  a stranger in a strange land
the rain was falling on the dirty pavements of liverpool as jerome left the vessel after her arrival
passing the customhouse he took a cab and proceeded to brown's hotel clayton square
finding no employment in liverpool jerome determined to go into the interior and seek for work
he therefore called for his bill and made ready for his departure
although but four days at the albion he found the hotel charges larger than he expected but a stranger generally counts on being fleeced in travelling through the old world and especially in great britain
after paying his bill he was about leaving the room when one of the servants presented himself with a low bow and said  something for the waiter sir
i thought i had paid my bill replied the man somewhat surprised at this polite dun
i am the waiter sir and gets only what strangers see fit to give me
taking from his pocket his nearly empty purse jerome handed the man a halfcrown but he had hardly restored it to his pocket before his eye fell on another man in the waiting costume
what do you want
he asked
whatever your honor sees fit to give me sir
i am the tother waiter
the purse was again taken from the pocket and another halfcrown handed out
stepping out into the hall he saw standing there a goodlooking woman in a white apron who made a very pretty courtesy
what's your business
he inquired
i am the chambermaid sir and looks after the gentlemen's beds
out came the purse again and was relieved of another halfcrown whereupon another girl with a fascinating smile took the place of the one who had just received her fee
what do you want
demanded the now halfangry jerome
please sir i am the tother chambermaid
finding it easier to give shillings than halfcrowns jerome handed the woman a shilling and again restored his purse to his pocket glad that another woman was not to be seen
scarcely had he commenced congratulating himself however before three men made their appearance one after another
what have you done for me
he asked of the first
i am the boots sir
the purse came out once more and a shilling was deposited in the servant's hand
what do i owe you
he inquired of the second
i took your honor's letter to the post yesterday sir
another shilling left the purse
in the name of the lord what am i indebted to you for
demanded jerome now entirely out of patience turning to the last of the trio
i told yer vership vot time it vas this morning
well
exclaimed the indignant man ask here what o'clock it is and you have got to pay for it
he paid this last demand with a sixpence regretting that he had not commenced with sixpences instead of halfcrowns
having cleared off all demands in the house he started for the railway station but had scarcely reached the street before he was accosted by an old man with a broom in his hand who with an exceedingly low bow said  i is here yer lordship
i did not send for you what is your business
demanded jerome
i is the man what opened your lordship's cabdoor when your lordship came to the house on monday last and i know your honor won't allow a poor man to starve
putting a sixpence in the old man's hand jerome once more started for the depot
having obtained letters of introduction to persons in manchester he found no difficulty in getting a situation in a large manufacturing house there
although the salary was small yet the situation was a much better one than he had hoped to obtain
his compensation as outdoor clerk enabled him to employ a man to teach him at night and by continued study and attention to business he was soon promoted
after three years in his new home jerome was placed in a still higher position where his salary amounted to fifteen hundred dollars a year
the drinking smoking and other expensive habits which the clerks usually indulged in he carefully avoided
being fond of poetry he turned his attention to literature
johnson's lives of the poets the writings of dryden addison pope clarendon and other authors of celebrity he read with attention
the knowledge which he thus picked up during his leisure hours gave him a great advantage over the other clerks and caused his employers to respect him far more than any other in their establishment
so eager was he to improve the time that he determined to see how much he could read during the unemployed time of night and morning and his success was beyond his expectations
chapter xxx  new friends
broken down in health after ten years of close confinement in his situation jerome resolved to give it up and thereby release himself from an employment which seemed calculated to send him to a premature grave
it was on a beautiful morning in summer that he started for scotland having made up his mind to travel for his health
after visiting edinburgh and glasgow he concluded to spend a few days in the old town of perth with a friend whose acquaintance he had made in manchester
during the second day of his stay in perth while crossing the main street jerome saw a ponychaise coming toward him with great speed
a lady who appeared to be the only occupant of the vehicle was using her utmost strength to stop the frightened horses
the footman in his fright had leaped from behind the carriage and was following with the crowd
with that selfforgetfulness which was one of his chief characteristics jerome threw himself before the horses to stop them and seizing the highspirited animals by the bit as they dashed by him he was dragged several rods before their speed was checked which was not accomplished until one of the horses had fallen to the ground with the heroic man struggling beneath him
all present were satisfied that this daring act alone had saved the lady's life for the chaise must inevitably have been dashed in pieces had the horses not been thus suddenly checked in their mad career
on the morning following this perilous adventure col gcalled at jerome's temporary residence and after expressing his admiration for his noble daring and thanking him for having saved his daughter's life invited him to visit him at his country residence
this invitation was promptly accepted in the spirit in which it was given and three days after jerome found himself at the princely residence of the father of the lady for whose safety he had risked his own life
the house was surrounded by fine trees and a sweet little stream ran murmuring at the foot while beds of flowers on every hand shed their odors on the summer air
it was indeed a pleasant place to spend the warm weather and the colonel and his family gave jerome a most cordial welcome
miss g showed especial attention to the stranger
he had not intended remaining longer than the following day but the family insisted on his taking part in a foxhunt that was to come off on the morning of the third day
wishing to witness a scene as interesting as the chase usually proves to be he decided to remain
fifteen persons five of whom were ladies were on the ground at the appointed hour
miss g was of course one of the party
in vain jerome endeavored to excuse himself from joining in the chase
his plea of illhealth was only met by smiles from the young ladies and the reply that a ride would effect a cure
dressed in a scarlet coat and high boots with the low round cap worn in the chase jerome mounted a highspirited horse whip in hand and made himself one of the party
in america riding is a necessity in england it is a pleasure
young men and women attend ridingschool in our fatherland and consider that they are studying a science
jerome was no rider
he had not been on horseback for more than ten years and as soon as he mounted every one saw that he was a novice and a smile was on the countenance of each member of the company
the blowing of the horn and assembling of the hounds and finally the release of the fox from his close prison were the signals for the chase to commence
the first halfmile the little animal took his course over a beautiful field where there was neither hedge nor ditch
thus far the chase was enjoyed by all even by the american rider who was better fitted to witness the scene than to take part in it
we left jerome in our last reluctantly engaged in the chase and though the first mile or so of the pursuit which was over smooth meadowland had had an exhilarating effect upon his mind and tended somewhat to relieve him of the embarrassment consequent upon his position he nevertheless still felt that he was far from being in his proper element
besides the fox had now made for a dense forest which lay before and he saw difficulties in that direction which to him appeared insurmountable
away went the huntsmen over stone walls high fences and deep ditches
jerome saw the ladies even leading the gentlemen but this could not inspire him
they cleared the fences four and five feet high with perfect ease showing they were quite at home in the saddle
but alas for the poor american
as his fine steed came up to the first fence and was about to make the leap jerome pulled at the bridle and cried at the top of his voice whoa
whoa
whoa
the horse at the same time capering about and appearing determined to keep up with the other animals
away dashed the huntsmen following the hounds and all were soon lost to the view of their colored companion
jerome rode up and down the field looking for a gate or bars that he might get through without risking his neck
finding however that all hope of again catching up with the party was out of the question he determined to return to the house under a plea of sudden illness and back he accordingly went
i hope no accident has happened to your honor said the groom as he met our hero at the gate
a slight dizziness was the answer
one of the servants without being ordered went at once for the family physician
ashamed to own that his return was owing to his inability to ride jerome resolved to feign sickness
the doctor came felt his pulse examined his tongue and pronounced him a sick man
he immediately ordered a tepid bath and sent for a couple of leeches
seeing things taking such a serious turn the american began to regret the part he was playing for there was no fun in being rubbed and leeched when one was in perfect health
he had gone too far to recede however and so submitted quietly to the directions of the doctor and after following the injunctions given by that learned esculapius was put to bed
shortly after the sound of the horns and the yelp of the hounds announced that the poor fox had taken the back track and was repassing near the house
even the pleasure of witnessing the beautiful sight from the window was denied to our hero for the physician had ordered that he must be kept in perfect quiet
the chase was at last over and the huntsmen all in sympathizing with their lost companion
after nine days of sweating blistering and leeching jerome left his bed convalescent but much reduced in flesh and strength
this was his first and last attempt to follow the fox and hounds
during his fortnight's stay at colonel g's jerome spent most of his time in the magnificent library
claude did not watch with more interest every color of the skies the trees the grass and the water to learn from nature than did this son of a despised race search books to obtain that knowledge which his early life as a slave had denied him
chapter xxxi  the mysterious meeting
after more than a fortnight spent in the highlands of scotland jerome passed hastily through london on his way to the continent
it was toward sunset on a warm day in october shortly after his arrival in france that after strolling some distance from the hotel de leon in the old and picturesque town of dunkirk he entered a burial groundsuch places being always favorite walks with himand wandered around among the silent dead
all nature around was hushed in silence and seemed to partake of the general melancholy that hung over the quiet restingplace of the departed
even the birds seemed imbued with the spirit of the place for they were silent either flying noiselessly over the graves or jumping about in the tall grass
after tracing the various inscriptions that told the characters and conditions of the deceased and viewing the mounds beneath which the dust of mortality slumbered he arrived at a secluded spot near where an aged weeping willow bowed its thick foliage to the ground as though anxious to hide from the scrutinizing gaze of curiosity the grave beneath it
jerome seated himself on a marble tombstone and commenced reading from a book which he had carried under his arm
it was now twilight and he had read but a few minutes when he observed a lady attired in deep black and leading a boy apparently some five or six years old coming up one of the beautiful winding paths
as the lady's veil was drawn closely over her face he felt somewhat at liberty to eye her more closely
while thus engaged the lady gave a slight scream and seemed suddenly to have fallen into a fainting condition
jerome sprang from his seat and caught her in time to save her from falling to the ground
at this moment an elderly gentleman also dressed in black was seen approaching with a hurried step which seemed to indicate that he was in some way connected with the lady
the old man came up and in rather a confused manner inquired what had happened and jerome explained matters as well as he was able to do so
after taking up the vinaigrette which had fallen from her hand and holding the bottle a short time to her face the lady began to revive
during all this time the veil had still partly covered the face of the fair one so that jerome had scarcely seen it
when she had so far recovered as to be able to look around her she raised herself slightly and again screamed and swooned
the old man now feeling satisfied that jerome's dark complexion was the immediate cause of the catastrophe said in a somewhat petulant tone  i will be glad sir if you will leave us alone
the little boy at this juncture set up a loud cry and amid the general confusion jerome left the ground and returned to his hotel
while seated at the window of his room looking out upon the crowded street with every now and then the strange scene in the graveyard vividly before him jerome suddenly thought of the book he had been reading and remembering that he had left it on the tombstone where he dropped it when called to the lady's assistance he determined to return for it at once
after a walk of some twenty minutes he found himself again in the burialground and on the spot where he had been an hour before
the pensive moon was already up and its soft light was sleeping on the little pond at the back of the grounds while the stars seemed smiling at their own sparkling rays gleaming up from the beautiful sheet of water
jerome searched in vain for his book it was nowhere to be found
nothing save the bouquet that the lady had dropped and which lay halfburied in the grass from having been trodden upon indicated that any one had been there that evening
the stillness of death reigned over the place even the little birds that had before been twittering and flying about had retired for the night
taking up the bunch of flowers jerome returned to his hotel
what can this mean
he would ask himself and why should they take my book
these questions he put to himself again and again during his walk
his sleep was broken more than once that night and he welcomed the early dawn as it made its appearance
chapter xxxii  the happy meeting
after passing a sleepless night and hearing the clock strike six jerome took from his table a book and thus endeavored to pass away the hours before breakfasttime
while thus engaged a servant entered and handed him a note
hastily tearing it open jerome read as follows  siri owe you an apology for the abrupt manner in which i addressed you last evening and the inconvenience to which you were subjected by some of my household
if you will honor us with your presence today at four o'clock i shall be most happy to give you due satisfaction
my servant will be waiting with the carriage at halfpast three
i am sir yours c                            j devenant
jerome fletcher esq
who this gentleman was and how he had found out his name and the hotel at which he was stopping were alike mysteries to jerome
and this note seemed to his puzzled brain like a challenge
satisfaction
he had not asked for satisfaction
however he resolved to accept the invitation and if need be meet the worst
at any rate this most mysterious and complicated affair would be explained
the clock on a neighboring church had scarcely finished striking three when a servant announced to jerome that a carriage had called for him
in a few minutes he was seated in a sumptuous barouche drawn by a pair of beautiful irongrays and rolling over a splendid gravel road entirely shaded by trees which appeared to have been the accumulated growth of many centuries
the carriage soon stopped at a low villa which was completely embowered in trees
jerome alighted and was shown into a superb room with the walls finely decorated with splendid tapestry and the ceilings exquisitely frescoed
the walls were hung with fine specimens from the hands of the great italian masters and one by a german artist representing a beautiful monkish legend connected with the holy catharine an illustrious lady of alexandria
highbacked chairs stood around the room rich curtains of crimson damask hung in folds on either side of the window and a beautiful rich turkey carpet covered the floor
in the centre of the room stood a table covered with books in the midst of which was a vase of fresh flowers loading the atmosphere with their odors
a faint light together with the quiet of the hour gave beauty beyond description to the whole scene
a halfopen door showed a fine marble floor to an adjoining room with pictures statues and antiquated sofas and flowerpots filled with rare plants of every kind and description
jerome had scarcely run his eyes over the beauties of the room when the elderly gentleman whom he had met on the previous evening made his appearance followed by the little boy and introduced himself as mr devenant
a moment more and a lady a beautiful brunette dressed in black with long black curls hanging over her shoulders entered the room
her dark bright eyes flashed as she caught the first sight of jerome
the gentleman immediately arose on the entrance of the lady and mr devenant was in the act of introducing the stranger when he observed that jerome had sunk back upon the sofa in a faint voice exclaiming  it is she
after this all was dark and dreary
how long he remained in this condition it was for others to tell
the lady knelt by his side and wept and when he came to he found himself stretched upon the sofa with his boots off and his head resting upon a pillow
by his side sat the old man with the smellingbottle in one hand and a glass of water in the other while the little boy stood at the foot of the sofa
as soon as jerome had so far recovered as to be able to speak he said  where am i and what does all this mean
wait awhile replied the old man and i will tell you all
after the lapse of some ten minutes jerome arose from the sofa adjusted his apparel and said  i am now ready to hear anything you have to say
you were born in america
said the old man
i was he replied
and you knew a girl named clotelle continued the old man
yes and i loved her as i can love none other
the lady whom you met so mysteriously last evening was she said mr devenant
jerome was silent but the fountain of mingled grief and joy stole out from beneath his eyelashes and glistened like pearls upon his ebony cheeks
at this juncture the lady again entered the room
with an enthusiasm that can be better imagined than described jerome sprang from the sofa and they rushed into each other's arms to the great surprise of the old gentleman and little autoine and to the amusement of the servants who had crept up one by one and were hid behind the doors or loitering in the hall
when they had given vent to their feelings and sufficiently recovered their presence of mind they resumed their seats
how did you find out my name and address
inquired jerome
after you had left the graveyard replied clotelle our little boy said 'oh mamma
if there ain't a book'
i opened the book and saw your name written in it and also found a card of the hotel de leon
papa wished to leave the book and said it was only a fancy of mine that i had ever seen you before but i was perfectly convinced that you were my own dear jerome
as she uttered the last words tearsthe sweet bright tears that love alone can bring forthbedewed her cheeks
are you married
now inquired clotelle with a palpitating heart and trembling voice
no i am not and never have been was jerome's reply
then thank god
she exclaimed in broken accents
it was then that hope gleamed up amid the crushed and broken flowers of her heart and a bright flash darted forth like a sunbeam
are you single now
asked jerome
yes i am was the answer
then you will be mine after all
said he with a smile
her dark rich hair had partly come down and hung still more loosely over her shoulders than when she first appeared and her eyes now full of animation and vivacity and her sweet harmonious and wellmodulated voice together with her modesty selfpossession and engaging manners made clotelle appear lovely beyond description
although past the age when men ought to think of matrimony yet the scene before mr devenant brought vividly to his mind the time when he was young and had a loving bosom companion living and tears were wiped from the old man's eyes
a new world seemed to unfold itself before the eyes of the happy lovers and they were completely absorbed in contemplating the future
furnished by nature with a disposition to study and a memory so retentive that all who knew her were surprised at the ease with which she acquired her education and general information clotelle might now be termed a most accomplished lady
after her marriage with young devenant they proceeded to india where the husband's regiment was stationed
soon after their arrival however a battle was fought with the natives in which several officers fell among whom was captain devenant
the father of the young captain being there at the time took his daughterinlaw and brought her back to france where they took up their abode at the old homestead
old mr devenant was possessed of a large fortune all of which he intended for his daughterinlaw and her only child
although clotelle had married young devenant she had not forgotten her first love and her fatherinlaw now willingly gave his consent to her marriage with jerome
jerome felt that to possess the woman of his love even at that late hour was compensation enough for the years that he had been separated from her and clotelle wanted no better evidence of his love for her than the fact of his having remained so long unmarried
it was indeed a rare instance of devotion and constancy in a man and the young widow gratefully appreciated it
it was late in the evening when jerome led his intended bride to the window and the magnificent moonlight illuminated the countenance of the lovely clotelle while inward sunshine emanating from a mind at ease and her own virtuous thoughts gave brightness to her eyes and made her appear a very angel
this was the first evening that jerome had been in her company since the night when to effect his escape from prison she disguised herself in male attire
how different the scene now
free instead of slaves wealthy instead of poor and on the eve of an event that seemed likely to result in a life of happiness to both
chapter xxxiii  the happy day
it was a bright day in the latter part of october that jerome and clotelle set out for the church where the marriage ceremony was to be performed
the clear bracing air added buoyancy to every movement and the sun poured its brilliant rays through the deeplystained windows as the happy couple entered the sanctuary followed by old mr devenant whose form bowed down with age attracted almost as much attention from the assembly as did the couple more particularly interested
as the ceremonies were finished and the priest pronounced the benediction on the newlymarried pair clotelle whispered in the ear of jerome    'no power in death shall tear our names apart   as none in life could rend thee from my heart'
a smile beamed on every face as the weddingparty left the church and entered their carriage
what a happy day after ten years' separation when both hearts having been blighted for a time they are brought together by the hand of a beneficent and kind providence and united in holy wedlock
everything being arranged for a wedding tour extending up the rhine the party set out the same day for antwerp
there are many rivers of greater length and width than the rhine
our mississippi would swallow up half a dozen rhines
the hudson is grander the tiber the po and the minclo more classic the thames and seine bear upon their waters greater amounts of wealth and commerce the nile and the euphrates have a greater antiquity but for a combination of interesting historical incidents and natural scenery the rhine surpasses them all
nature has so ordained it that those who travel in the valley of the rhine shall see the river for there never will be a railroad upon its banks
so mountainous is the land that it would have to be one series of tunnels
every three or four miles from the time you enter this glorious river hills dales castles and crags present themselves as the steamer glides onward
their first restingplace for any length of time was at coblentz at the mouth of the blue moselle the most interesting place on the river
from coblentz they went to brussels where they had the greatest attention paid them
besides being provided with letters of introduction jerome's complexion secured for him more deference than is usually awarded to travellers
having letters of introduction to m deceptiax the great lace manufacturer that gentleman received them with distinguished honors and gave them a splendid soiree at which the elite of the city were assembled
the sumptuouslyfurnished mansion was lavishly decorated for the occasion and every preparation made that could add to the novelty or interest of the event
jerome with his beautiful bride next visited cologne the largest and wealthiest city on the banks of the rhine
the cathedral of cologne is the most splendid structure of the kind in europe and jerome and clotelle viewed with interest the beautiful arches and columns of this stupendous building which strikes with awe the beholder as he gazes at its unequalled splendor surrounded as it is by villas cottages and palacelike mansions with the enchanting rhine winding through the vinecovered hills
after strolling over miles and miles of classic ground and visiting castles whose legends and traditions have given them an enduring fame our delighted travellers started for geneva bidding the picturesque banks of the rhine a regretful farewell
being much interested in literature and aware that geneva was noted for having been the city of refuge to the victims of religious and political persecution jerome arranged to stay here for some days
he was provided with a letter of introduction to m de stee who had been a fellowsoldier of mr devenant in the east india wars and they were invited to make his house their home during their sojourn
on the side of a noble mountain whose base is kissed by the waves of lake geneva and whose slopes are decked with verdure to the utmost peak of its rocky crown is situated the delightful country residence of this wealthy retired french officer
a winding road with frequent climbs and brakes leads from the valley to this enchanting spot the air and scenery of which cannot be surpassed in the world
chapter xxxiv  clotelle meets her father
the clouds that had skirted the sky during the day broke at last and the rain fell in torrents as jerome and clotelle retired for the night in the little town of ferney on the borders of lake leman
the peals of thunder and flashes of vivid lightening which seemed to leap from mountain to mountain and from crag to crag reverberating among the surrounding hills foretold a heavy storm
i would we were back at geneva said clotelle as she heard groans issuing from an adjoining room
the sounds at first faint grew louder and louder plainly indicating that some person was suffering extreme pain
i did not like this hotel much when we came in i said jerome relighting the lamp which had been accidentally extinguished
nor i returned clotelle
the shrieks increased and an occasional she's dead
i killed her
no she is not dead
and suchlike expressions would be heard from the person who seemed to be deranged
the thunder grew louder and the flashes of lightning more vivid while the noise from the sickroom seemed to increase
as jerome opened the door to learn if possible the cause of the cries and groans he could distinguish the words she's dead
yes she's dead
but i did not kill her
she was my child
my own daughter
i loved her and yet i did not protect her
whoever he is said jerome he's crackbrained some robber probably from the mountains
the storm continued to rage and the loud peals of thunder and sharp flashes of lightening together with the shrieks and moans of the maniac in the adjoining room made the night a fearful one
the long hours wore slowly away but neither jerome nor his wife could sleep and they arose at an early hour in the morning ordered breakfast and resolved to return to geneva
i am sorry sir that you were so much disturbed by the sick man last night said the landlord as he handed jerome his bill
i should be glad if he would get able to go away or die for he's a deal of trouble to me
several persons have left my house on his account
where is he from
inquired jerome
he's from the united states and has been here a week today and has been crazy ever since
has he no friends with him
asked the guest
no he is alone was the reply
jerome related to his wife what he had learned from the landlord respecting the sick man and the intelligence impressed her so strongly that she requested him to make further inquiries concerning the stranger
he therefore consulted the book in which guests usually register their names and to his great surprise found that the american's name was henry linwood and that he was from richmond va
it was with feelings of trepidation that clotelle heard these particulars from the lips of her husband
we must see this poor man whoever he is said she as jerome finished the sentence
the landlord was glad to hear that his guests felt some interest in the sick man and promised that the invalid's room should be got ready for their reception
the clock in the hall was just striking ten as jerome passed through and entered the sick man's chamber
stretched upon a mattress with both hands tightly bound to the bedstead the friendless stranger was indeed a pitiful sight
his dark dishevelled hair prematurely gray his long unshaven beard and the wildness of the eyes which glanced upon them as they opened the door and entered caused the faint hope which had so suddenly risen in clotelle's heart to sink and she felt that this man could claim no kindred with her
certainly he bore no resemblance to the man whom she had called her father and who had fondly dandled her on his knee in those happy days of childhood
help
cried the poor man as jerome and his wife walked into the room
his eyes glared and shriek after shriek broke forth from his parched and fevered lips
no i did not kill my daughteri did not
she is not dead
yes she is dead
but i did not kill herpoor girl look
that is she
no it cannot be
she cannot come here
it cannot be my poor clotelle
at the sound of her own name coming from the maniac's lips clotelle gasped for breath and her husband saw that she had grown deadly pale
it seemed evident to him that the man was either guilty of some terrible act or imagined himself to be
his eyeballs rolled in their sockets and his features showed that he was undergoing the tortures of that inward hell which seemed to set his whole brain on fire
after recovering her selfpossession and strength clotelle approached the bedside and laid her soft hand upon the stranger's hot and fevered brow
one long loud shriek rang out on the air and a piercing cry it is sheyes it is she
i see i see
ah
no it is not my daughter
she would not come to me if she could
broke forth from him
i am your daughter said clotelle as she pressed her handkerchief to her face and sobbed aloud
like balls of fire the poor man's eyes rolled and glared upon the company while large drops of perspiration ran down his pale and emaciated face
strange as the scene appeared all present saw that it was indeed a meeting between a father and his longlost daughter
jerome now ordered all present to leave the room except the nurse and every effort was at once made to quiet the sufferer
when calm a joyous smile would illuminate the sick man's face and a strange light beam in his eyes as he seemed to realize that she who stood before him was indeed his child
for two long days and nights did clotelle watch at the bedside of her father before he could speak to her intelligently
sometimes in his insane fits he would rave in the most frightful manner and then in a few moments would be as easily governed as a child
at last however after a long and apparently refreshing sleep he awoke suddenly to a full consciousness that it was indeed his daughter who was watching so patiently by his side
the presence of his long absent child had a soothing effect upon mr linwood and he now recovered rapidly from the sad and almost hopeless condition in which she had found him
when able to converse without danger of a relapse he told clotelle of his fruitless efforts to obtain a clew to her whereabouts after old mrs miller had sold her to the slavetrader
in answer to his daughter's inquiries about his family affairs up to the time that he left america he said  i blamed my wife for your being sold and sent away for i thought she and her mother were acting in collusion but i afterwards found that i had blamed her wrongfully
poor woman
she knew that i loved your mother and feeling herself forsaken she grew melancholy and died in a decline three years ago
here both father and daughter wept at the thought of other days
when they had recovered their composure mr linwood went on again  old mrs miller said he after the death of gertrude aware that she had contributed much toward her unhappiness took to the free use of intoxicating drinks and became the most brutal creature that ever lived
she whipped her slaves without the slightest provocation and seemed to take delight in inventing new tortures with which to punish them
one night last winter after having flogged one of her slaves nearly to death she returned to her room and by some means the bedding took fire and the house was in flames before any one was awakened
there was no one in the building at the time but the old woman and the slaves and although the latter might have saved their mistress they made no attempt to do so
thus after a frightful career of many years this hardhearted woman died a most miserable death unlamented by a single person
clotelle wiped the tears from her eyes as her father finished this story for although mrs miller had been her greatest enemy she regretted to learn that her end had been such a sad one
my peace of mind destroyed resumed the father and broke down in health my physician advised me to travel with the hope o recruiting myself and i sailed from new york two months ago
being brought up in america and having all the prejudice against color which characterizes his white fellowcountrymen mr linwood very much regretted that his daughter although herself tinctured with african blood should have married a black man and he did not fail to express to her his dislike of her husband's complexion
i married him said clotelle because i loved him
why should the white man be esteemed as better than the black
i find no difference in men on account of their complexion
one of the cardinal principles of christianity and freedom is the equality and brotherhood of man
every day mr linwood became more and more familiar with jerome and eventually they were on the most intimate terms
fifteen days from the time that clotelle was introduced into her father's room they left ferney for geneva
many were the excursions clotelle made under the shadows of mont blanc and with her husband and father for companions she was now in the enjoyment of pleasures hitherto unknown
chapter xxxv  the father's resolve
aware that her father was still a slaveowner clotelle determined to use all her persuasive power to induce him to set them free and in this effort she found a substantial supporter in her husband
i have always treated my slaves well said mr linwood to jerome as the latter expressed his abhorrence of the system and my neighbors too are generally good men for slavery in
virginia is not like slavery in the other states continued the proud son of the old dominion
their right to be free mr linwood said jerome is taken from them and they have no security for their comfort but the humanity and generosity of men who have been trained to regard them not as brethren but as mere property
humanity and generosity are at best but poor guaranties for the protection of those who cannot assert their rights and over whom law throws no protection
it was with pleasure that clotelle obtained from her father a promise that he would liberate all his slaves on his return to richmond
in a beautiful little villa situated in a pleasant spot fringed with hoary rocks and thick dark woods within sight of the deep blue waters of lake leman mr linwood his daughter and her husband took up their residence for a short time
for more than three weeks this little party spent their time in visiting the birthplace of rousseau and the former abodes of byron gibbon voltaire de stael shelley and other literary characters
we can scarcely contemplate a visit to a more historic and interesting place than geneva and its vicinity
here calvin that great luminary in the church lived and ruled for years here voltaire the mighty genius who laid the foundation of the french revolution and who boasted when i shake my wig i powder the whole republic governed in the higher walks of life
fame is generally the recompense not of the living but of the deadnot always do they reap and gather in the harvest who sow the seed the flame of its altar is too often kindled from the ashes of the great
a distinguished critic has beautifully said the sound which the stream of high thought carried down to future ages makes as it flowsdeep distant murmuring ever more like the waters of the mighty ocean
no reputation can be called great that will not endure this test
the distinguished men who had lived in geneva transfused their spirit by their writings into the spirit of other lovers of literature and everything that treated of great authors
jerome and clotelle lingered long in and about the haunts of geneva and lake leman
an autumn sun sent down her bright rays and bathed every object in her glorious light as clotelle accompanied by her husband and father set out one fine morning on her return home to france
throughout the whole route mr linwood saw by the deference paid to jerome whose black complexion excited astonishment in those who met him that there was no hatred to the man in europe on account of his color that what is called prejudice against color is the offspring of the institution of slavery and he felt ashamed of his own countrymen when he thought of the complexion as distinctions made in the united states and resolved to dedicate the remainder of his life to the eradication of this unrepublican and unchristian feeling from the land of his birth on his return home
after a stay of four weeks at dunkirk the home of the fletchers mr linwood set out for america with the full determination of freeing his slaves and settling them in one of the northern states and then to return to france to end his days in the society of his beloved daughter
the end
