chapter i
the introduction to the work or bill of fare to the feast
an author ought to consider himself not as a gentleman who gives a private or eleemosynary treat but rather as one who keeps a public ordinary at which all persons are welcome for their money
in the former case it is well known that the entertainer provides what fare he pleases and though this should be very indifferent and utterly disagreeable to the taste of his company they must not find any fault nay on the contrary good breeding forces them outwardly to approve and to commend whatever is set before them
now the contrary of this happens to the master of an ordinary
men who pay for what they eat will insist on gratifying their palates however nice and whimsical these may prove and if everything is not agreeable to their taste will challenge a right to censure to abuse and to dn their dinner without controul
to prevent therefore giving offence to their customers by any such disappointment it hath been usual with the honest and wellmeaning host to provide a bill of fare which all persons may peruse at their first entrance into the house and having thence acquainted themselves with the entertainment which they may expect may either stay and regale with what is provided for them or may depart to some other ordinary better accommodated to their taste
as we do not disdain to borrow wit or wisdom from any man who is capable of lending us either we have condescended to take a hint from these honest victuallers and shall prefix not only a general bill of fare to our whole entertainment but shall likewise give the reader particular bills to every course which is to be served up in this and the ensuing volumes
the provision then which we have here made is no other than human nature
nor do i fear that my sensible reader though most luxurious in his taste will start cavil or be offended because i have named but one article
the tortoiseas the alderman of bristol well learned in eating knows by much experiencebesides the delicious calipash and calipee contains many different kinds of food nor can the learned reader be ignorant that in human nature though here collected under one general name is such prodigious variety that a cook will have sooner gone through all the several species of animal and vegetable food in the world than an author will be able to exhaust so extensive a subject
an objection may perhaps be apprehended from the more delicate that this dish is too common and vulgar for what else is the subject of all the romances novels plays and poems with which the stalls abound
many exquisite viands might be rejected by the epicure if it was a sufficient cause for his contemning of them as common and vulgar that something was to be found in the most paltry alleys under the same name
in reality true nature is as difficult to be met with in authors as the bayonne ham or bologna sausage is to be found in the shops
but the whole to continue the same metaphor consists in the cookery of the author for as mr pope tells us      true wit is nature to advantage drest     what oft was thought but ne'er so well exprest  the same animal which hath the honour to have some part of his flesh eaten at the table of a duke may perhaps be degraded in another part and some of his limbs gibbeted as it were in the vilest stall in town
where then lies the difference between the food of the nobleman and the porter if both are at dinner on the same ox or calf but in the seasoning the dressing the garnishing and the setting forth
hence the one provokes and incites the most languid appetite and the other turns and palls that which is the sharpest and keenest
in like manner the excellence of the mental entertainment consists less in the subject than in the author's skill in well dressing it up
how pleased therefore will the reader be to find that we have in the following work adhered closely to one of the highest principles of the best cook which the present age or perhaps that of heliogabalus hath produced
this great man as is well known to all lovers of polite eating begins at first by setting plain things before his hungry guests rising afterwards by degrees as their stomachs may be supposed to decrease to the very quintessence of sauce and spices
in like manner we shall represent human nature at first to the keen appetite of our reader in that more plain and simple manner in which it is found in the country and shall hereafter hash and ragoo it with all the high french and italian seasoning of affectation and vice which courts and cities afford
by these means we doubt not but our reader may be rendered desirous to read on for ever as the great person just abovementioned is supposed to have made some persons eat
having premised thus much we will now detain those who like our bill of fare no longer from their diet and shall proceed directly to serve up the first course of our history for their entertainment
chapter ii
a short description of squire allworthy and a fuller account of miss bridget allworthy his sister
in that part of the western division of this kingdom which is commonly called somersetshire there lately lived and perhaps lives still a gentleman whose name was allworthy and who might well be called the favourite of both nature and fortune for both of these seem to have contended which should bless and enrich him most
in this contention nature may seem to some to have come off victorious as she bestowed on him many gifts while fortune had only one gift in her power but in pouring forth this she was so very profuse that others perhaps may think this single endowment to have been more than equivalent to all the various blessings which he enjoyed from nature
from the former of these he derived an agreeable person a sound constitution a solid understanding and a benevolent heart by the latter he was decreed to the inheritance of one of the largest estates in the county
this gentleman had in his youth married a very worthy and beautiful woman of whom he had been extremely fond by her he had three children all of whom died in their infancy
he had likewise had the misfortune of burying this beloved wife herself about five years before the time in which this history chuses to set out
this loss however great he bore like a man of sense and constancy though it must be confest he would often talk a little whimsically on this head for he sometimes said he looked on himself as still married and considered his wife as only gone a little before him a journey which he should most certainly sooner or later take after her and that he had not the least doubt of meeting her again in a place where he should never part with her moresentiments for which his sense was arraigned by one part of his neighbours his religion by a second and his sincerity by a third
he now lived for the most part retired in the country with one sister for whom he had a very tender affection
this lady was now somewhat past the age of thirty an aera at which in the opinion of the malicious the title of old maid may with no impropriety be assumed
she was of that species of women whom you commend rather for good qualities than beauty and who are generally called by their own sex very good sort of womenas good a sort of woman madam as you would wish to know
indeed she was so far from regretting want of beauty that she never mentioned that perfection if it can be called one without contempt and would often thank god she was not as handsome as miss suchaone whom perhaps beauty had led into errors which she might have otherwise avoided
miss bridget allworthy for that was the name of this lady very rightly conceived the charms of person in a woman to be no better than snares for herself as well as for others and yet so discreet was she in her conduct that her prudence was as much on the guard as if she had all the snares to apprehend which were ever laid for her whole sex
indeed i have observed though it may seem unaccountable to the reader that this guard of prudence like the trained bands is always readiest to go on duty where there is the least danger
it often basely and cowardly deserts those paragons for whom the men are all wishing sighing dying and spreading every net in their power and constantly attends at the heels of that higher order of women for whom the other sex have a more distant and awful respect and whom from despair i suppose of success they never venture to attack
reader i think proper before we proceed any farther together to acquaint thee that i intend to digress through this whole history as often as i see occasion of which i am myself a better judge than any pitiful critic whatever and here i must desire all those critics to mind their own business and not to intermeddle with affairs or works which no ways concern them for till they produce the authority by which they are constituted judges i shall not plead to their jurisdiction
chapter iii
an odd accident which befel mr allworthy at his return home
the decent behaviour of mrs deborah wilkins with some proper animadversions on bastards
i have told my reader in the preceding chapter that mr allworthy inherited a large fortune that he had a good heart and no family
hence doubtless it will be concluded by many that he lived like an honest man owed no one a shilling took nothing but what was his own kept a good house entertained his neighbours with a hearty welcome at his table and was charitable to the poor ie
to those who had rather beg than work by giving them the offals from it that he died immensely rich and built an hospital
and true it is that he did many of these things but had he done nothing more i should have left him to have recorded his own merit on some fair freestone over the door of that hospital
matters of a much more extraordinary kind are to be the subject of this history or i should grossly misspend my time in writing so voluminous a work and you my sagacious friend might with equal profit and pleasure travel through some pages which certain droll authors have been facetiously pleased to call the history of england
mr allworthy had been absent a full quarter of a year in london on some very particular business though i know not what it was but judge of its importance by its having detained him so long from home whence he had not been absent a month at a time during the space of many years
he came to his house very late in the evening and after a short supper with his sister retired much fatigued to his chamber
here having spent some minutes on his kneesa custom which he never broke through on any accounthe was preparing to step into bed when upon opening the cloathes to his great surprize he beheld an infant wrapt up in some coarse linen in a sweet and profound sleep between his sheets
he stood some time lost in astonishment at this sight but as good nature had always the ascendant in his mind he soon began to be touched with sentiments of compassion for the little wretch before him
he then rang his bell and ordered an elderly womanservant to rise immediately and come to him and in the meantime was so eager in contemplating the beauty of innocence appearing in those lively colours with which infancy and sleep always display it that his thoughts were too much engaged to reflect that he was in his shirt when the matron came in
she had indeed given her master sufficient time to dress himself for out of respect to him and regard to decency she had spent many minutes in adjusting her hair at the lookingglass notwithstanding all the hurry in which she had been summoned by the servant and though her master for aught she knew lay expiring in an apoplexy or in some other fit
it will not be wondered at that a creature who had so strict a regard to decency in her own person should be shocked at the least deviation from it in another
she therefore no sooner opened the door and saw her master standing by the bedside in his shirt with a candle in his hand than she started back in a most terrible fright and might perhaps have swooned away had he not now recollected his being undrest and put an end to her terrors by desiring her to stay without the door till he had thrown some cloathes over his back and was become incapable of shocking the pure eyes of mrs deborah wilkins who though in the fiftysecond year of her age vowed she had never beheld a man without his coat
sneerers and prophane wits may perhaps laugh at her first fright yet my graver reader when he considers the time of night the summons from her bed and the situation in which she found her master will highly justify and applaud her conduct unless the prudence which must be supposed to attend maidens at that period of life at which mrs deborah had arrived should a little lessen his admiration
when mrs deborah returned into the room and was acquainted by her master with the finding the little infant her consternation was rather greater than his had been nor could she refrain from crying out with great horror of accent as well as look my good sir
what's to be done mr allworthy answered she must take care of the child that evening and in the morning he would give orders to provide it a nurse
yes sir says she and i hope your worship will send out your warrant to take up the hussy its mother for she must be one of the neighbourhood and i should be glad to see her committed to bridewell and whipt at the cart's tail
indeed such wicked sluts cannot be too severely punished
i'll warrant 'tis not her first by her impudence in laying it to your worship in laying it to me deborah answered allworthy i can't think she hath any such design
i suppose she hath only taken this method to provide for her child and truly i am glad she hath not done worse i don't know what is worse cries deborah than for such wicked strumpets to lay their sins at honest men's doors and though your worship knows your own innocence yet the world is censorious and it hath been many an honest man's hap to pass for the father of children he never begot and if your worship should provide for the child it may make the people the apter to believe besides why should your worship provide for what the parish is obliged to maintain
for my own part if it was an honest man's child indeedbut for my own part it goes against me to touch these misbegotten wretches whom i don't look upon as my fellowcreatures
faugh
how it stinks
it doth not smell like a christian
if i might be so bold to give my advice i would have it put in a basket and sent out and laid at the churchwarden's door
it is a good night only a little rainy and windy and if it was well wrapt up and put in a warm basket it is two to one but it lives till it is found in the morning
but if it should not we have discharged our duty in taking proper care of it and it is perhaps better for such creatures to die in a state of innocence than to grow up and imitate their mothers for nothing better can be expected of them  there were some strokes in this speech which perhaps would have offended mr allworthy had he strictly attended to it but he had now got one of his fingers into the infant's hand which by its gentle pressure seeming to implore his assistance had certainly outpleaded the eloquence of mrs deborah had it been ten times greater than it was
he now gave mrs deborah positive orders to take the child to her own bed and to call up a maidservant to provide it pap and other things against it waked
he likewise ordered that proper cloathes should be procured for it early in the morning and that it should be brought to himself as soon as he was stirring
such was the discernment of mrs wilkins and such the respect she bore her master under whom she enjoyed a most excellent place that her scruples gave way to his peremptory commands and she took the child under her arms without any apparent disgust at the illegality of its birth and declaring it was a sweet little infant walked off with it to her own chamber
allworthy here betook himself to those pleasing slumbers which a heart that hungers after goodness is apt to enjoy when thoroughly satisfied
as these are possibly sweeter than what are occasioned by any other hearty meal i should take more pains to display them to the reader if i knew any air to recommend him to for the procuring such an appetite
chapter iv
the reader's neck brought into danger by a description his escape and the great condescension of miss bridget allworthy
the gothic stile of building could produce nothing nobler than mr allworthy's house
there was an air of grandeur in it that struck you with awe and rivalled the beauties of the best grecian architecture and it was as commodious within as venerable without
it stood on the southeast side of a hill but nearer the bottom than the top of it so as to be sheltered from the northeast by a grove of old oaks which rose above it in a gradual ascent of near half a mile and yet high enough to enjoy a most charming prospect of the valley beneath
in the midst of the grove was a fine lawn sloping down towards the house near the summit of which rose a plentiful spring gushing out of a rock covered with firs and forming a constant cascade of about thirty feet not carried down a regular flight of steps but tumbling in a natural fall over the broken and mossy stones till it came to the bottom of the rock then running off in a pebly channel that with many lesser falls winded along till it fell into a lake at the foot of the hill about a quarter of a mile below the house on the south side and which was seen from every room in the front
out of this lake which filled the center of a beautiful plain embellished with groups of beeches and elms and fed with sheep issued a river that for several miles was seen to meander through an amazing variety of meadows and woods till it emptied itself into the sea with a large arm of which and an island beyond it the prospect was closed
on the right of this valley opened another of less extent adorned with several villages and terminated by one of the towers of an old ruined abby grown over with ivy and part of the front which remained still entire
the lefthand scene presented the view of a very fine park composed of very unequal ground and agreeably varied with all the diversity that hills lawns wood and water laid out with admirable taste but owing less to art than to nature could give
beyond this the country gradually rose into a ridge of wild mountains the tops of which were above the clouds
it was now the middle of may and the morning was remarkably serene when mr allworthy walked forth on the terrace where the dawn opened every minute that lovely prospect we have before described to his eye and now having sent forth streams of light which ascended the blue firmament before him as harbingers preceding his pomp in the full blaze of his majesty rose the sun than which one object alone in this lower creation could be more glorious and that mr allworthy himself presenteda human being replete with benevolence meditating in what manner he might render himself most acceptable to his creator by doing most good to his creatures
reader take care
i have unadvisedly led thee to the top of as high a hill as mr allworthy's and how to get thee down without breaking thy neck i do not well know
however let us e'en venture to slide down together for miss bridget rings her bell and mr allworthy is summoned to breakfast where i must attend and if you please shall be glad of your company
the usual compliments having past between mr allworthy and miss bridget and the tea being poured out he summoned mrs wilkins and told his sister he had a present for her for which she thanked himimagining i suppose it had been a gown or some ornament for her person
indeed he very often made her such presents and she in complacence to him spent much time in adorning herself
i say in complacence to him because she always exprest the greatest contempt for dress and for those ladies who made it their study
but if such was her expectation how was she disappointed when mrs wilkins according to the order she had received from her master produced the little infant
great surprizes as hath been observed are apt to be silent and so was miss bridget till her brother began and told her the whole story which as the reader knows it already we shall not repeat
miss bridget had always exprest so great a regard for what the ladies are pleased to call virtue and had herself maintained such a severity of character that it was expected especially by wilkins that she would have vented much bitterness on this occasion and would have voted for sending the child as a kind of noxious animal immediately out of the house but on the contrary she rather took the goodnatured side of the question intimated some compassion for the helpless little creature and commended her brother's charity in what he had done
perhaps the reader may account for this behaviour from her condescension to mr allworthy when we have informed him that the good man had ended his narrative with owning a resolution to take care of the child and to breed him up as his own for to acknowledge the truth she was always ready to oblige her brother and very seldom if ever contradicted his sentiments
she would indeed sometimes make a few observations as that men were headstrong and must have their own way and would wish she had been blest with an independent fortune but these were always vented in a low voice and at the most amounted only to what is called muttering
however what she withheld from the infant she bestowed with the utmost profuseness on the poor unknown mother whom she called an impudent slut a wanton hussy an audacious harlot a wicked jade a vile strumpet with every other appellation with which the tongue of virtue never fails to lash those who bring a disgrace on the sex
a consultation was now entered into how to proceed in order to discover the mother
a scrutiny was first made into the characters of the female servants of the house who were all acquitted by mrs wilkins and with apparent merit for she had collected them herself and perhaps it would be difficult to find such another set of scarecrows
the next step was to examine among the inhabitants of the parish and this was referred to mrs wilkins who was to enquire with all imaginable diligence and to make her report in the afternoon
matters being thus settled mr allworthy withdrew to his study as was his custom and left the child to his sister who at his desire had undertaken the care of it
chapter v  containing a few common matters with a very uncommon observation upon them
when her master was departed mrs deborah stood silent expecting her cue from miss bridget for as to what had past before her master the prudent housekeeper by no means relied upon it as she had often known the sentiments of the lady in her brother's absence to differ greatly from those which she had expressed in his presence
miss bridget did not however suffer her to continue long in this doubtful situation for having looked some time earnestly at the child as it lay asleep in the lap of mrs deborah the good lady could not forbear giving it a hearty kiss at the same time declaring herself wonderfully pleased with its beauty and innocence
mrs deborah no sooner observed this than she fell to squeezing and kissing with as great raptures as sometimes inspire the sage dame of forty and five towards a youthful and vigorous bridegroom crying out in a shrill voice o the dear little creaturethe dear sweet pretty creature
well i vow it is as fine a boy as ever was seen  these exclamations continued till they were interrupted by the lady who now proceeded to execute the commission given her by her brother and gave orders for providing all necessaries for the child appointing a very good room in the house for his nursery
her orders were indeed so liberal that had it been a child of her own she could not have exceeded them but lest the virtuous reader may condemn her for showing too great regard to a baseborn infant to which all charity is condemned by law as irreligious we think proper to observe that she concluded the whole with saying since it was her brother's whim to adopt the little brat she supposed little master must be treated with great tenderness
for her part she could not help thinking it was an encouragement to vice but that she knew too much of the obstinacy of mankind to oppose any of their ridiculous humours  with reflections of this nature she usually as has been hinted accompanied every act of compliance with her brother's inclinations and surely nothing could more contribute to heighten the merit of this compliance than a declaration that she knew at the same time the folly and unreasonableness of those inclinations to which she submitted
tacit obedience implies no force upon the will and consequently may be easily and without any pains preserved but when a wife a child a relation or a friend performs what we desire with grumbling and reluctance with expressions of dislike and dissatisfaction the manifest difficulty which they undergo must greatly enhance the obligation
as this is one of those deep observations which very few readers can be supposed capable of making themselves i have thought proper to lend them my assistance but this is a favour rarely to be expected in the course of my work
indeed i shall seldom or never so indulge him unless in such instances as this where nothing but the inspiration with which we writers are gifted can possibly enable any one to make the discovery
chapter vi
mrs deborah is introduced into the parish with a simile
a short account of jenny jones with the difficulties and discouragements which may attend young women in the pursuit of learning
mrs deborah having disposed of the child according to the will of her master now prepared to visit those habitations which were supposed to conceal its mother
not otherwise than when a kite tremendous bird is beheld by the feathered generation soaring aloft and hovering over their heads the amorous dove and every innocent little bird spread wide the alarm and fly trembling to their hidingplaces
he proudly beats the air conscious of his dignity and meditates intended mischief
so when the approach of mrs deborah was proclaimed through the street all the inhabitants ran trembling into their houses each matron dreading lest the visit should fall to her lot
she with stately steps proudly advances over the field aloft she bears her towering head filled with conceit of her own preeminence and schemes to effect her intended discovery
the sagacious reader will not from this simile imagine these poor people had any apprehension of the design with which mrs wilkins was now coming towards them but as the great beauty of the simile may possibly sleep these hundred years till some future commentator shall take this work in hand i think proper to lend the reader a little assistance in this place
it is my intention therefore to signify that as it is the nature of a kite to devour little birds so is it the nature of such persons as mrs wilkins to insult and tyrannize over little people
this being indeed the means which they use to recompense to themselves their extreme servility and condescension to their superiors for nothing can be more reasonable than that slaves and flatterers should exact the same taxes on all below them which they themselves pay to all above them
whenever mrs deborah had occasion to exert any extraordinary condescension to mrs bridget and by that means had a little soured her natural disposition it was usual with her to walk forth among these people in order to refine her temper by venting and as it were purging off all ill humours on which account she was by no means a welcome visitant to say the truth she was universally dreaded and hated by them all
on her arrival in this place she went immediately to the habitation of an elderly matron to whom as this matron had the good fortune to resemble herself in the comeliness of her person as well as in her age she had generally been more favourable than to any of the rest
to this woman she imparted what had happened and the design upon which she was come thither that morning
these two began presently to scrutinize the characters of the several young girls who lived in any of those houses and at last fixed their strongest suspicion on one jenny jones who they both agreed was the likeliest person to have committed this fact
this jenny jones was no very comely girl either in her face or person but nature had somewhat compensated the want of beauty with what is generally more esteemed by those ladies whose judgment is arrived at years of perfect maturity for she had given her a very uncommon share of understanding
this gift jenny had a good deal improved by erudition
she had lived several years a servant with a schoolmaster who discovering a great quickness of parts in the girl and an extraordinary desire of learningfor every leisure hour she was always found reading in the books of the scholarshad the goodnature or follyjust as the reader pleases to call itto instruct her so far that she obtained a competent skill in the latin language and was perhaps as good a scholar as most of the young men of quality of the age
this advantage however like most others of an extraordinary kind was attended with some small inconveniences for as it is not to be wondered at that a young woman so well accomplished should have little relish for the society of those whom fortune had made her equals but whom education had rendered so much her inferiors so is it matter of no greater astonishment that this superiority in jenny together with that behaviour which is its certain consequence should produce among the rest some little envy and illwill towards her and these had perhaps secretly burnt in the bosoms of her neighbours ever since her return from her service
their envy did not however display itself openly till poor jenny to the surprize of everybody and to the vexation of all the young women in these parts had publickly shone forth on a sunday in a new silk gown with a laced cap and other proper appendages to these
the flame which had before lain in embryo now burst forth
jenny had by her learning increased her own pride which none of her neighbours were kind enough to feed with the honour she seemed to demand and now instead of respect and adoration she gained nothing but hatred and abuse by her finery
the whole parish declared she could not come honestly by such things and parents instead of wishing their daughters the same felicitated themselves that their children had them not
hence perhaps it was that the good woman first mentioned the name of this poor girl to mrs wilkins but there was another circumstance that confirmed the latter in her suspicion for jenny had lately been often at mr allworthy's house
she had officiated as nurse to miss bridget in a violent fit of illness and had sat up many nights with that lady besides which she had been seen there the very day before mr allworthy's return by mrs wilkins herself though that sagacious person had not at first conceived any suspicion of her on that account for as she herself said she had always esteemed jenny as a very sober girl though indeed she knew very little of her and had rather suspected some of those wanton trollops who gave themselves airs because forsooth they thought themselves handsome  jenny was now summoned to appear in person before mrs deborah which she immediately did
when mrs deborah putting on the gravity of a judge with somewhat more than his austerity began an oration with the words you audacious strumpet in which she proceeded rather to pass sentence on the prisoner than to accuse her
though mrs deborah was fully satisfied of the guilt of jenny from the reasons above shewn it is possible mr allworthy might have required some stronger evidence to have convicted her but she saved her accusers any such trouble by freely confessing the whole fact with which she was charged
this confession though delivered rather in terms of contrition as it appeared did not at all mollify mrs deborah who now pronounced a second judgment against her in more opprobrious language than before nor had it any better success with the bystanders who were now grown very numerous
many of them cried out they thought what madam's silk gown would end in others spoke sarcastically of her learning
not a single female was present but found some means of expressing her abhorrence of poor jenny who bore all very patiently except the malice of one woman who reflected upon her person and tossing up her nose said the man must have a good stomach who would give silk gowns for such sort of trumpery jenny replied to this with a bitterness which might have surprized a judicious person who had observed the tranquillity with which she bore all the affronts to her chastity but her patience was perhaps tired out for this is a virtue which is very apt to be fatigued by exercise
mrs deborah having succeeded beyond her hopes in her inquiry returned with much triumph and at the appointed hour made a faithful report to mr allworthy who was much surprized at the relation for he had heard of the extraordinary parts and improvements of this girl whom he intended to have given in marriage together with a small living to a neighbouring curate
his concern therefore on this occasion was at least equal to the satisfaction which appeared in mrs deborah and to many readers may seem much more reasonable
miss bridget blessed herself and said for her part she should never hereafter entertain a good opinion of any woman for jenny before this had the happiness of being much in her good graces also
the prudent housekeeper was again dispatched to bring the unhappy culprit before mr allworthy in order not as it was hoped by some and expected by all to be sent to the house of correction but to receive wholesome admonition and reproof which those who relish that kind of instructive writing may peruse in the next chapter
chapter vii
containing such grave matter that the reader cannot laugh once through the whole chapter unless peradventure he should laugh at the author
when jenny appeared mr allworthy took her into his study and spoke to her as follows you know child it is in my power as a magistrate to punish you very rigorously for what you have done and you will perhaps be the more apt to fear i should execute that power because you have in a manner laid your sins at my door
but perhaps this is one reason which hath determined me to act in a milder manner with you for as no private resentment should ever influence a magistrate i will be so far from considering your having deposited the infant in my house as an aggravation of your offence that i will suppose in your favour this to have proceeded from a natural affection to your child since you might have some hopes to see it thus better provided for than was in the power of yourself or its wicked father to provide for it
i should indeed have been highly offended with you had you exposed the little wretch in the manner of some inhuman mothers who seem no less to have abandoned their humanity than to have parted with their chastity
it is the other part of your offence therefore upon which i intend to admonish you i mean the violation of your chastitya crime however lightly it may be treated by debauched persons very heinous in itself and very dreadful in its consequences
the heinous nature of this offence must be sufficiently apparent to every christian inasmuch as it is committed in defiance of the laws of our religion and of the express commands of him who founded that religion
and here its consequences may well be argued to be dreadful for what can be more so than to incur the divine displeasure by the breach of the divine commands and that in an instance against which the highest vengeance is specifically denounced
but these things though too little i am afraid regarded are so plain that mankind however they may want to be reminded can never need information on this head
a hint therefore to awaken your sense of this matter shall suffice for i would inspire you with repentance and not drive you to desperation
there are other consequences not indeed so dreadful or replete with horror as this and yet such as if attentively considered must one would think deter all of your sex at least from the commission of this crime
for by it you are rendered infamous and driven like lepers of old out of society at least from the society of all but wicked and reprobate persons for no others will associate with you
if you have fortunes you are hereby rendered incapable of enjoying them if you have none you are disabled from acquiring any nay almost of procuring your sustenance for no persons of character will receive you into their houses
thus you are often driven by necessity itself into a state of shame and misery which unavoidably ends in the destruction of both body and soul
can any pleasure compensate these evils
can any temptation have sophistry and delusion strong enough to persuade you to so simple a bargain
or can any carnal appetite so overpower your reason or so totally lay it asleep as to prevent your flying with affright and terror from a crime which carries such punishment always with it
how base and mean must that woman be how void of that dignity of mind and decent pride without which we are not worthy the name of human creatures who can bear to level herself with the lowest animal and to sacrifice all that is great and noble in her all her heavenly part to an appetite which she hath in common with the vilest branch of the creation
for no woman sure will plead the passion of love for an excuse
this would be to own herself the mere tool and bubble of the man
love however barbarously we may corrupt and pervert its meaning as it is a laudable is a rational passion and can never be violent but when reciprocal for though the scripture bids us love our enemies it means not with that fervent love which we naturally bear towards our friends much less that we should sacrifice to them our lives and what ought to be dearer to us our innocence
now in what light but that of an enemy can a reasonable woman regard the man who solicits her to entail on herself all the misery i have described to you and who would purchase to himself a short trivial contemptible pleasure so greatly at her expense
for by the laws of custom the whole shame with all its dreadful consequences falls intirely upon her
can love which always seeks the good of its object attempt to betray a woman into a bargain where she is so greatly to be the loser
if such corrupter therefore should have the impudence to pretend a real affection for her ought not the woman to regard him not only as an enemy but as the worst of all enemies a false designing treacherous pretended friend who intends not only to debauch her body but her understanding at the same time  here jenny expressing great concern allworthy paused a moment and then proceeded i have talked thus to you child not to insult you for what is past and irrevocable but to caution and strengthen you for the future
nor should i have taken this trouble but from some opinion of your good sense notwithstanding the dreadful slip you have made and from some hopes of your hearty repentance which are founded on the openness and sincerity of your confession
if these do not deceive me i will take care to convey you from this scene of your shame where you shall by being unknown avoid the punishment which as i have said is allotted to your crime in this world and i hope by repentance you will avoid the much heavier sentence denounced against it in the other
be a good girl the rest of your days and want shall be no motive to your going astray and believe me there is more pleasure even in this world in an innocent and virtuous life than in one debauched and vicious
as to your child let no thoughts concerning it molest you i will provide for it in a better manner than you can ever hope
and now nothing remains but that you inform me who was the wicked man that seduced you for my anger against him will be much greater than you have experienced on this occasion  jenny now lifted her eyes from the ground and with a modest look and decent voice thus began  to know you sir and not love your goodness would be an argument of total want of sense or goodness in any one
in me it would amount to the highest ingratitude not to feel in the most sensible manner the great degree of goodness you have been pleased to exert on this occasion
as to my concern for what is past i know you will spare my blushes the repetition
my future conduct will much better declare my sentiments than any professions i can now make
i beg leave to assure you sir that i take your advice much kinder than your generous offer with which you concluded it for as you are pleased to say sir it is an instance of your opinion of my understandinghere her tears flowing apace she stopped a few moments and then proceeded thusindeed sir your kindness overcomes me but i will endeavour to deserve this good opinion for if i have the understanding you are so kindly pleased to allow me such advice cannot be thrown away upon me
i thank you sir heartily for your intended kindness to my poor helpless child he is innocent and i hope will live to be grateful for all the favours you shall show him
but now sir i must on my knees entreat you not to persist in asking me to declare the father of my infant
i promise you faithfully you shall one day know but i am under the most solemn ties and engagements of honour as well as the most religious vows and protestations to conceal his name at this time
and i know you too well to think you would desire i should sacrifice either my honour or my religion  mr allworthy whom the least mention of those sacred words was sufficient to stagger hesitated a moment before he replied and then told her she had done wrong to enter into such engagements to a villain but since she had he could not insist on her breaking them
he said it was not from a motive of vain curiosity he had inquired but in order to punish the fellow at least that he might not ignorantly confer favours on the undeserving
as to these points jenny satisfied him by the most solemn assurances that the man was entirely out of his reach and was neither subject to his power nor in any probability of becoming an object of his goodness
the ingenuity of this behaviour had gained jenny so much credit with this worthy man that he easily believed what she told him for as she had disdained to excuse herself by a lie and had hazarded his further displeasure in her present situation rather than she would forfeit her honour or integrity by betraying another he had but little apprehensions that she would be guilty of falsehood towards himself
he therefore dismissed her with assurances that he would very soon remove her out of the reach of that obloquy she had incurred concluding with some additional documents in which he recommended repentance saying consider child there is one still to reconcile yourself to whose favour is of much greater importance to you than mine    chapter viii
a dialogue between mesdames bridget and deborah containing more amusement but less instruction than the former
when mr allworthy had retired to his study with jenny jones as hath been seen mrs bridget with the good housekeeper had betaken themselves to a post next adjoining to the said study whence through the conveyance of a keyhole they sucked in at their ears the instructive lecture delivered by mr allworthy together with the answers of jenny and indeed every other particular which passed in the last chapter
this hole in her brother's studydoor was indeed as well known to mrs bridget and had been as frequently applied to by her as the famous hole in the wall was by thisbe of old
this served to many good purposes
for by such means mrs bridget became often acquainted with her brother's inclinations without giving him the trouble of repeating them to her
it is true some inconveniences attended this intercourse and she had sometimes reason to cry out with thisbe in shakspeare o wicked wicked wall for as mr allworthy was a justice of peace certain things occurred in examinations concerning bastards and such like which are apt to give great offence to the chaste ears of virgins especially when they approach the age of forty as was the case of mrs bridget
however she had on such occasions the advantage of concealing her blushes from the eyes of men and de non apparentibus et non existentibus eadem est ratioin english when a woman is not seen to blush she doth not blush at all  both the good women kept strict silence during the whole scene between mr allworthy and the girl but as soon as it was ended and that gentleman was out of hearing mrs deborah could not help exclaiming against the clemency of her master and especially against his suffering her to conceal the father of the child which she swore she would have out of her before the sun set
at these words mrs bridget discomposed her features with a smile a thing very unusual to her
not that i would have my reader imagine that this was one of those wanton smiles which homer would have you conceive came from venus when he calls her the laughterloving goddess nor was it one of those smiles which lady seraphina shoots from the stagebox and which venus would quit her immortality to be able to equal
no this was rather one of those smiles which might be supposed to have come from the dimpled cheeks of the august tisiphone or from one of the misses her sisters
with such a smile then and with a voice sweet as the evening breeze of boreas in the pleasant month of november mrs bridget gently reproved the curiosity of mrs deborah a vice with which it seems the latter was too much tainted and which the former inveighed against with great bitterness adding that among all her faults she thanked heaven her enemies could not accuse her of prying into the affairs of other people  she then proceeded to commend the honour and spirit with which jenny had acted
she said she could not help agreeing with her brother that there was some merit in the sincerity of her confession and in her integrity to her lover that she had always thought her a very good girl and doubted not but she had been seduced by some rascal who had been infinitely more to blame than herself and very probably had prevailed with her by a promise of marriage or some other treacherous proceeding
this behaviour of mrs bridget greatly surprised mrs deborah for this wellbred woman seldom opened her lips either to her master or his sister till she had first sounded their inclinations with which her sentiments were always consonant
here however she thought she might have launched forth with safety and the sagacious reader will not perhaps accuse her of want of sufficient forecast in so doing but will rather admire with what wonderful celerity she tacked about when she found herself steering a wrong course
nay madam said this able woman and truly great politician i must own i cannot help admiring the girl's spirit as well as your ladyship
and as your ladyship says if she was deceived by some wicked man the poor wretch is to be pitied
and to be sure as your ladyship says the girl hath always appeared like a good honest plain girl and not vain of her face forsooth as some wanton husseys in the neighbourhood are  you say true deborah said miss bridget
if the girl had been one of those vain trollops of which we have too many in the parish i should have condemned my brother for his lenity towards her
i saw two farmers' daughters at church the other day with bare necks
i protest they shocked me
if wenches will hang out lures for fellows it is no matter what they suffer
i detest such creatures and it would be much better for them that their faces had been seamed with the smallpox but i must confess i never saw any of this wanton behaviour in poor jenny some artful villain i am convinced hath betrayed nay perhaps forced her and i pity the poor wretch with all my heart  mrs deborah approved all these sentiments and the dialogue concluded with a general and bitter invective against beauty and with many compassionate considerations for all honest plain girls who are deluded by the wicked arts of deceitful men
chapter ix
containing matters which will surprize the reader
jenny returned home well pleased with the reception she had met with from mr allworthy whose indulgence to her she industriously made public partly perhaps as a sacrifice to her own pride and partly from the more prudent motive of reconciling her neighbours to her and silencing their clamours
but though this latter view if she indeed had it may appear reasonable enough yet the event did not answer her expectation for when she was convened before the justice and it was universally apprehended that the house of correction would have been her fate though some of the young women cryed out it was good enough for her  and diverted themselves with the thoughts of her beating hemp in a silk gown yet there were many others who began to pity her condition but when it was known in what manner mr allworthy had behaved the tide turned against her
one said i'll assure you madam hath had good luck a second cryed see what it is to be a favourite a third ay this comes of her learning every person made some malicious comment or other on the occasion and reflected on the partiality of the justice
the behaviour of these people may appear impolitic and ungrateful to the reader who considers the power and benevolence of mr allworthy
but as to his power he never used it and as to his benevolence he exerted so much that he had thereby disobliged all his neighbours for it is a secret well known to great men that by conferring an obligation they do not always procure a friend but are certain of creating many enemies
jenny was however by the care and goodness of mr allworthy soon removed out of the reach of reproach when malice being no longer able to vent its rage on her began to seek another object of its bitterness and this was no less than mr allworthy himself for a whisper soon went abroad that he himself was the father of the foundling child
this supposition so well reconciled his conduct to the general opinion that it met with universal assent and the outcry against his lenity soon began to take another turn and was changed into an invective against his cruelty to the poor girl
very grave and good women exclaimed against men who begot children and then disowned them
nor were there wanting some who after the departure of jenny insinuated that she was spirited away with a design too black to be mentioned and who gave frequent hints that a legal inquiry ought to be made into the whole matter and that some people should be forced to produce the girl
these calumnies might have probably produced ill consequences at the least might have occasioned some trouble to a person of a more doubtful and suspicious character than mr allworthy was blessed with but in his case they had no such effect and being heartily despised by him they served only to afford an innocent amusement to the good gossips of the neighbourhood
but as we cannot possibly divine what complection our reader may be of and as it will be some time before he will hear any more of jenny we think proper to give him a very early intimation that mr allworthy was and will hereafter appear to be absolutely innocent of any criminal intention whatever
he had indeed committed no other than an error in politics by tempering justice with mercy and by refusing to gratify the goodnatured disposition of the mob with an object for their compassion to work on in the person of poor jenny whom in order to pity they desired to have seen sacrificed to ruin and infamy by a shameful correction in bridewell
whenever this word occurs in our writings it intends persons   without virtue or sense in all stations and many of the highest   rank are often meant by it
so far from complying with this their inclination by which all hopes of reformation would have been abolished and even the gate shut against her if her own inclinations should ever hereafter lead her to chuse the road of virtue mr allworthy rather chose to encourage the girl to return thither by the only possible means for too true i am afraid it is that many women have become abandoned and have sunk to the last degree of vice by being unable to retrieve the first slip
this will be i am afraid always the case while they remain among their former acquaintance it was therefore wisely done by mr allworthy to remove jenny to a place where she might enjoy the pleasure of reputation after having tasted the ill consequences of losing it
to this place therefore wherever it was we will wish her a good journey and for the present take leave of her and of the little foundling her child having matters of much higher importance to communicate to the reader
chapter x
the hospitality of allworthy with a short sketch of the characters of two brothers a doctor and a captain who were entertained by that gentleman
neither mr allworthy's house nor his heart were shut against any part of mankind but they were both more particularly open to men of merit
to say the truth this was the only house in the kingdom where you was sure to gain a dinner by deserving it
above all others men of genius and learning shared the principal place in his favour and in these he had much discernment for though he had missed the advantage of a learned education yet being blest with vast natural abilities he had so well profited by a vigorous though late application to letters and by much conversation with men of eminence in this way that he was himself a very competent judge in most kinds of literature
it is no wonder that in an age when this kind of merit is so little in fashion and so slenderly provided for persons possessed of it should very eagerly flock to a place where they were sure of being received with great complaisance indeed where they might enjoy almost the same advantages of a liberal fortune as if they were entitled to it in their own right for mr allworthy was not one of those generous persons who are ready most bountifully to bestow meat drink and lodging on men of wit and learning for which they expect no other return but entertainment instruction flattery and subserviency in a word that such persons should be enrolled in the number of domestics without wearing their master's cloathes or receiving wages
on the contrary every person in this house was perfect master of his own time and as he might at his pleasure satisfy all his appetites within the restrictions only of law virtue and religion so he might if his health required or his inclination prompted him to temperance or even to abstinence absent himself from any meals or retire from them whenever he was so disposed without even a sollicitation to the contrary for indeed such sollicitations from superiors always savour very strongly of commands
but all here were free from such impertinence not only those whose company is in all other places esteemed a favour from their equality of fortune but even those whose indigent circumstances make such an eleemosynary abode convenient to them and who are therefore less welcome to a great man's table because they stand in need of it
among others of this kind was dr blifil a gentleman who had the misfortune of losing the advantage of great talents by the obstinacy of a father who would breed him to a profession he disliked
in obedience to this obstinacy the doctor had in his youth been obliged to study physic or rather to say he studied it for in reality books of this kind were almost the only ones with which he was unacquainted and unfortunately for him the doctor was master of almost every other science but that by which he was to get his bread the consequence of which was that the doctor at the age of forty had no bread to eat
such a person as this was certain to find a welcome at mr allworthy's table to whom misfortunes were ever a recommendation when they were derived from the folly or villany of others and not of the unfortunate person himself
besides this negative merit the doctor had one positive recommendationthis was a great appearance of religion
whether his religion was real or consisted only in appearance i shall not presume to say as i am not possessed of any touchstone which can distinguish the true from the false
if this part of his character pleased mr allworthy it delighted miss bridget
she engaged him in many religious controversies on which occasions she constantly expressed great satisfaction in the doctor's knowledge and not much less in the compliments which he frequently bestowed on her own
to say the truth she had read much english divinity and had puzzled more than one of the neighbouring curates
indeed her conversation was so pure her looks so sage and her whole deportment so grave and solemn that she seemed to deserve the name of saint equally with her namesake or with any other female in the roman kalendar
as sympathies of all kinds are apt to beget love so experience teaches us that none have a more direct tendency this way than those of a religious kind between persons of different sexes
the doctor found himself so agreeable to miss bridget that he now began to lament an unfortunate accident which had happened to him about ten years before namely his marriage with another woman who was not only still alive but what was worse known to be so by mr allworthy
this was a fatal bar to that happiness which he otherwise saw sufficient probability of obtaining with this young lady for as to criminal indulgences he certainly never thought of them
this was owing either to his religion as is most probable or to the purity of his passion which was fixed on those things which matrimony only and not criminal correspondence could put him in possession of or could give him any title to
he had not long ruminated on these matters before it occurred to his memory that he had a brother who was under no such unhappy incapacity
this brother he made no doubt would succeed for he discerned as he thought an inclination to marriage in the lady and the reader perhaps when he hears the brother's qualifications will not blame the confidence which he entertained of his success
this gentleman was about thirtyfive years of age
he was of a middle size and what is called wellbuilt
he had a scar on his forehead which did not so much injure his beauty as it denoted his valour for he was a halfpay officer
he had good teeth and something affable when he pleased in his smile though naturally his countenance as well as his air and voice had much of roughness in it yet he could at any time deposit this and appear all gentleness and goodhumour
he was not ungenteel nor entirely devoid of wit and in his youth had abounded in sprightliness which though he had lately put on a more serious character he could when he pleased resume
he had as well as the doctor an academic education for his father had with the same paternal authority we have mentioned before decreed him for holy orders but as the old gentleman died before he was ordained he chose the church military and preferred the king's commission to the bishop's
he had purchased the post of lieutenant of dragoons and afterwards came to be a captain but having quarrelled with his colonel was by his interest obliged to sell from which time he had entirely rusticated himself had betaken himself to studying the scriptures and was not a little suspected of an inclination to methodism
it seemed therefore not unlikely that such a person should succeed with a lady of so saintlike a disposition and whose inclinations were no otherwise engaged than to the marriage state in general but why the doctor who certainly had no great friendship for his brother should for his sake think of making so ill a return to the hospitality of allworthy is a matter not so easy to be accounted for
is it that some natures delight in evil as others are thought to delight in virtue
or is there a pleasure in being accessory to a theft when we cannot commit it ourselves
or lastly which experience seems to make probable have we a satisfaction in aggrandizing our families even though we have not the least love or respect for them
whether any of these motives operated on the doctor we will not determine but so the fact was
he sent for his brother and easily found means to introduce him at allworthy's as a person who intended only a short visit to himself
the captain had not been in the house a week before the doctor had reason to felicitate himself on his discernment
the captain was indeed as great a master of the art of love as ovid was formerly
he had besides received proper hints from his brother which he failed not to improve to the best advantage
chapter xi
containing many rules and some examples concerning falling in love descriptions of beauty and other more prudential inducements to matrimony
it hath been observed by wise men or women i forget which that all persons are doomed to be in love once in their lives
no particular season is as i remember assigned for this but the age at which miss bridget was arrived seems to me as proper a period as any to be fixed on for this purpose it often indeed happens much earlier but when it doth not i have observed it seldom or never fails about this time
moreover we may remark that at this season love is of a more serious and steady nature than what sometimes shows itself in the younger parts of life
the love of girls is uncertain capricious and so foolish that we cannot always discover what the young lady would be at nay it may almost be doubted whether she always knows this herself
now we are never at a loss to discern this in women about forty for as such grave serious and experienced ladies well know their own meaning so it is always very easy for a man of the least sagacity to discover it with the utmost certainty
miss bridget is an example of all these observations
she had not been many times in the captain's company before she was seized with this passion
nor did she go pining and moping about the house like a puny foolish girl ignorant of her distemper she felt she knew and she enjoyed the pleasing sensation of which as she was certain it was not only innocent but laudable she was neither afraid nor ashamed
and to say the truth there is in all points great difference between the reasonable passion which women at this age conceive towards men and the idle and childish liking of a girl to a boy which is often fixed on the outside only and on things of little value and no duration as on cherrycheeks small lilywhite hands sloeblack eyes flowing locks downy chins dapper shapes nay sometimes on charms more worthless than these and less the party's own such are the outward ornaments of the person for which men are beholden to the taylor the laceman the periwigmaker the hatter and the milliner and not to nature
such a passion girls may well be ashamed as they generally are to own either to themselves or others
the love of miss bridget was of another kind
the captain owed nothing to any of these fopmakers in his dress nor was his person much more beholden to nature
both his dress and person were such as had they appeared in an assembly or a drawingroom would have been the contempt and ridicule of all the fine ladies there
the former of these was indeed neat but plain coarse illfancied and out of fashion
as for the latter we have expressly described it above
so far was the skin on his cheeks from being cherrycoloured that you could not discern what the natural colour of his cheeks was they being totally overgrown by a black beard which ascended to his eyes
his shape and limbs were indeed exactly proportioned but so large that they denoted the strength rather of a ploughman than any other
his shoulders were broad beyond all size and the calves of his legs larger than those of a common chairman
in short his whole person wanted all that elegance and beauty which is the very reverse of clumsy strength and which so agreeably sets off most of our fine gentlemen being partly owing to the high blood of their ancestors viz blood made of rich sauces and generous wines and partly to an early town education
though miss bridget was a woman of the greatest delicacy of taste yet such were the charms of the captain's conversation that she totally overlooked the defects of his person
she imagined and perhaps very wisely that she should enjoy more agreeable minutes with the captain than with a much prettier fellow and forewent the consideration of pleasing her eyes in order to procure herself much more solid satisfaction
the captain no sooner perceived the passion of miss bridget in which discovery he was very quicksighted than he faithfully returned it
the lady no more than her lover was remarkable for beauty
i would attempt to draw her picture but that is done already by a more able master mr hogarth himself to whom she sat many years ago and hath been lately exhibited by that gentleman in his print of a winter's morning of which she was no improper emblem and may be seen walking for walk she doth in the print to covent garden church with a starved footboy behind carrying her prayerbook
the captain likewise very wisely preferred the more solid enjoyments he expected with this lady to the fleeting charms of person
he was one of those wise men who regard beauty in the other sex as a very worthless and superficial qualification or to speak more truly who rather chuse to possess every convenience of life with an ugly woman than a handsome one without any of those conveniences
and having a very good appetite and but little nicety he fancied he should play his part very well at the matrimonial banquet without the sauce of beauty
to deal plainly with the reader the captain ever since his arrival at least from the moment his brother had proposed the match to him long before he had discovered any flattering symptoms in miss bridget had been greatly enamoured that is to say of mr allworthy's house and gardens and of his lands tenements and hereditaments of all which the captain was so passionately fond that he would most probably have contracted marriage with them had he been obliged to have taken the witch of endor into the bargain
as mr allworthy therefore had declared to the doctor that he never intended to take a second wife as his sister was his nearest relation and as the doctor had fished out that his intentions were to make any child of hers his heir which indeed the law without his interposition would have done for him the doctor and his brother thought it an act of benevolence to give being to a human creature who would be so plentifully provided with the most essential means of happiness
the whole thoughts therefore of both the brothers were how to engage the affections of this amiable lady
but fortune who is a tender parent and often doth more for her favourite offspring than either they deserve or wish had been so industrious for the captain that whilst he was laying schemes to execute his purpose the lady conceived the same desires with himself and was on her side contriving how to give the captain proper encouragement without appearing too forward for she was a strict observer of all rules of decorum
in this however she easily succeeded for as the captain was always on the lookout no glance gesture or word escaped him
the satisfaction which the captain received from the kind behaviour of miss bridget was not a little abated by his apprehensions of mr allworthy for notwithstanding his disinterested professions the captain imagined he would when he came to act follow the example of the rest of the world and refuse his consent to a match so disadvantageous in point of interest to his sister
from what oracle he received this opinion i shall leave the reader to determine but however he came by it it strangely perplexed him how to regulate his conduct so as at once to convey his affection to the lady and to conceal it from her brother
he at length resolved to take all private opportunities of making his addresses but in the presence of mr allworthy to be as reserved and as much upon his guard as was possible and this conduct was highly approved by the brother
he soon found means to make his addresses in express terms to his mistress from whom he received an answer in the proper form viz
 the answer which was first made some thousands of years ago and which hath been handed down by tradition from mother to daughter ever since
if i was to translate this into latin i should render it by these two words nolo episcopari a phrase likewise of immemorial use on another occasion
the captain however he came by his knowledge perfectly well understood the lady and very soon after repeated his application with more warmth and earnestness than before and was again according to due form rejected but as he had increased in the eagerness of his desires so the lady with the same propriety decreased in the violence of her refusal
not to tire the reader by leading him through every scene of this courtship which though in the opinion of a certain great author it is the pleasantest scene of life to the actor is perhaps as dull and tiresome as any whatever to the audience the captain made his advances in form the citadel was defended in form and at length in proper form surrendered at discretion
during this whole time which filled the space of near a month the captain preserved great distance of behaviour to his lady in the presence of the brother and the more he succeeded with her in private the more reserved was he in public
and as for the lady she had no sooner secured her lover than she behaved to him before company with the highest degree of indifference so that mr allworthy must have had the insight of the devil or perhaps some of his worse qualities to have entertained the least suspicion of what was going forward
chapter xii
containing what the reader may perhaps expect to find in it
in all bargains whether to fight or to marry or concerning any other such business little previous ceremony is required to bring the matter to an issue when both parties are really in earnest
this was the case at present and in less than a month the captain and his lady were man and wife
the great concern now was to break the matter to mr allworthy and this was undertaken by the doctor
one day then as allworthy was walking in his garden the doctor came to him and with great gravity of aspect and all the concern which he could possibly affect in his countenance said i am come sir to impart an affair to you of the utmost consequence but how shall i mention to you what it almost distracts me to think of he then launched forth into the most bitter invectives both against men and women accusing the former of having no attachment but to their interest and the latter of being so addicted to vicious inclinations that they could never be safely trusted with one of the other sex
could i said he sir have suspected that a lady of such prudence such judgment such learning should indulge so indiscreet a passion
or could i have imagined that my brotherwhy do i call him so
he is no longer a brother of mine  indeed but he is said allworthy and a brother of mine too  bless me sir said the doctor do you know the shocking affair  look'ee mr blifil answered the good man it hath been my constant maxim in life to make the best of all matters which happen
my sister though many years younger than i is at least old enough to be at the age of discretion
had he imposed on a child i should have been more averse to have forgiven him but a woman upwards of thirty must certainly be supposed to know what will make her most happy
she hath married a gentleman though perhaps not quite her equal in fortune and if he hath any perfections in her eye which can make up that deficiency i see no reason why i should object to her choice of her own happiness which i no more than herself imagine to consist only in immense wealth
i might perhaps from the many declarations i have made of complying with almost any proposal have expected to have been consulted on this occasion but these matters are of a very delicate nature and the scruples of modesty perhaps are not to be overcome
as to your brother i have really no anger against him at all
he hath no obligations to me nor do i think he was under any necessity of asking my consent since the woman is as i have said sui juris and of a proper age to be entirely answerable only to herself for her conduct  the doctor accused mr allworthy of too great lenity repeated his accusations against his brother and declared that he should never more be brought either to see or to own him for his relation
he then launched forth into a panegyric on allworthy's goodness into the highest encomiums on his friendship and concluded by saying he should never forgive his brother for having put the place which he bore in that friendship to a hazard
allworthy thus answered had i conceived any displeasure against your brother i should never have carried that resentment to the innocent but i assure you i have no such displeasure
your brother appears to me to be a man of sense and honour
i do not disapprove the taste of my sister nor will i doubt but that she is equally the object of his inclinations
i have always thought love the only foundation of happiness in a married state as it can only produce that high and tender friendship which should always be the cement of this union and in my opinion all those marriages which are contracted from other motives are greatly criminal they are a profanation of a most holy ceremony and generally end in disquiet and misery for surely we may call it a profanation to convert this most sacred institution into a wicked sacrifice to lust or avarice and what better can be said of those matches to which men are induced merely by the consideration of a beautiful person or a great fortune
to deny that beauty is an agreeable object to the eye and even worthy some admiration would be false and foolish
beautiful is an epithet often used in scripture and always mentioned with honour
it was my own fortune to marry a woman whom the world thought handsome and i can truly say i liked her the better on that account
but to make this the sole consideration of marriage to lust after it so violently as to overlook all imperfections for its sake or to require it so absolutely as to reject and disdain religion virtue and sense which are qualities in their nature of much higher perfection only because an elegance of person is wanting this is surely inconsistent either with a wise man or a good christian
and it is perhaps being too charitable to conclude that such persons mean anything more by their marriage than to please their carnal appetites for the satisfaction of which we are taught it was not ordained
in the next place with respect to fortune
worldly prudence perhaps exacts some consideration on this head nor will i absolutely and altogether condemn it
as the world is constituted the demands of a married state and the care of posterity require some little regard to what we call circumstances
yet this provision is greatly increased beyond what is really necessary by folly and vanity which create abundantly more wants than nature
equipage for the wife and large fortunes for the children are by custom enrolled in the list of necessaries and to procure these everything truly solid and sweet and virtuous and religious are neglected and overlooked
and this in many degrees the last and greatest of which seems scarce distinguishable from madnessi mean where persons of immense fortunes contract themselves to those who are and must be disagreeable to themto fools and knavesin order to increase an estate already larger even than the demands of their pleasures
surely such persons if they will not be thought mad must own either that they are incapable of tasting the sweets of the tenderest friendship or that they sacrifice the greatest happiness of which they are capable to the vain uncertain and senseless laws of vulgar opinion which owe as well their force as their foundation to folly  here allworthy concluded his sermon to which blifil had listened with the profoundest attention though it cost him some pains to prevent now and then a small discomposure of his muscles
he now praised every period of what he had heard with the warmth of a young divine who hath the honour to dine with a bishop the same day in which his lordship hath mounted the pulpit
chapter xiii
which concludes the first book with an instance of ingratitude which we hope will appear unnatural
the reader from what hath been said may imagine that the reconciliation if indeed it could be so called was only matter of form we shall therefore pass it over and hasten to what must surely be thought matter of substance
the doctor had acquainted his brother with what had past between mr allworthy and him and added with a smile i promise you i paid you off nay i absolutely desired the good gentleman not to forgive you for you know after he had made a declaration in your favour i might with safety venture on such a request with a person of his temper and i was willing as well for your sake as for my own to prevent the least possibility of a suspicion  captain blifil took not the least notice of this at that time but he afterwards made a very notable use of it
one of the maxims which the devil in a late visit upon earth left to his disciples is when once you are got up to kick the stool from under you
in plain english when you have made your fortune by the good offices of a friend you are advised to discard him as soon as you can
whether the captain acted by this maxim i will not positively determine so far we may confidently say that his actions may be fairly derived from this diabolical principle and indeed it is difficult to assign any other motive to them for no sooner was he possessed of miss bridget and reconciled to allworthy than he began to show a coldness to his brother which increased daily till at length it grew into rudeness and became very visible to every one
the doctor remonstrated to him privately concerning this behaviour but could obtain no other satisfaction than the following plain declaration if you dislike anything in my brother's house sir you know you are at liberty to quit it this strange cruel and almost unaccountable ingratitude in the captain absolutely broke the poor doctor's heart for ingratitude never so thoroughly pierces the human breast as when it proceeds from those in whose behalf we have been guilty of transgressions
reflections on great and good actions however they are received or returned by those in whose favour they are performed always administer some comfort to us but what consolation shall we receive under so biting a calamity as the ungrateful behaviour of our friend when our wounded conscience at the same time flies in our face and upbraids us with having spotted it in the service of one so worthless
mr allworthy himself spoke to the captain in his brother's behalf and desired to know what offence the doctor had committed when the hardhearted villain had the baseness to say that he should never forgive him for the injury which he had endeavoured to do him in his favour which he said he had pumped out of him and was such a cruelty that it ought not to be forgiven
allworthy spoke in very high terms upon this declaration which he said became not a human creature
he expressed indeed so much resentment against an unforgiving temper that the captain at last pretended to be convinced by his arguments and outwardly professed to be reconciled
as for the bride she was now in her honeymoon and so passionately fond of her new husband that he never appeared to her to be in the wrong and his displeasure against any person was a sufficient reason for her dislike to the same
the captain at mr allworthy's instance was outwardly as we have said reconciled to his brother yet the same rancour remained in his heart and he found so many opportunities of giving him private hints of this that the house at last grew insupportable to the poor doctor and he chose rather to submit to any inconveniences which he might encounter in the world than longer to bear these cruel and ungrateful insults from a brother for whom he had done so much
he once intended to acquaint allworthy with the whole but he could not bring himself to submit to the confession by which he must take to his share so great a portion of guilt
besides by how much the worse man he represented his brother to be so much the greater would his own offence appear to allworthy and so much the greater he had reason to imagine would be his resentment
he feigned therefore some excuse of business for his departure and promised to return soon again and took leave of his brother with so welldissembled content that as the captain played his part to the same perfection allworthy remained well satisfied with the truth of the reconciliation
the doctor went directly to london where he died soon after of a broken heart a distemper which kills many more than is generally imagined and would have a fair title to a place in the bill of mortality did it not differ in one instance from all other diseasesviz that no physician can cure it
now upon the most diligent enquiry into the former lives of these two brothers i find besides the cursed and hellish maxim of policy above mentioned another reason for the captain's conduct the captain besides what we have before said of him was a man of great pride and fierceness and had always treated his brother who was of a different complexion and greatly deficient in both these qualities with the utmost air of superiority
the doctor however had much the larger share of learning and was by many reputed to have the better understanding
this the captain knew and could not bear for though envy is at best a very malignant passion yet is its bitterness greatly heightened by mixing with contempt towards the same object and very much afraid i am that whenever an obligation is joined to these two indignation and not gratitude will be the product of all three

chapter i
showing what kind of a history this is what it is like and what it is not like
though we have properly enough entitled this our work a history and not a life nor an apology for a life as is more in fashion yet we intend in it rather to pursue the method of those writers who profess to disclose the revolutions of countries than to imitate the painful and voluminous historian who to preserve the regularity of his series thinks himself obliged to fill up as much paper with the detail of months and years in which nothing remarkable happened as he employs upon those notable aeras when the greatest scenes have been transacted on the human stage
such histories as these do in reality very much resemble a newspaper which consists of just the same number of words whether there be any news in it or not
they may likewise be compared to a stage coach which performs constantly the same course empty as well as full
the writer indeed seems to think himself obliged to keep even pace with time whose amanuensis he is and like his master travels as slowly through centuries of monkish dulness when the world seems to have been asleep as through that bright and busy age so nobly distinguished by the excellent latin poet       ad confligendum venientibus undique poenis      omnia cum belli trepido concussa tumultu      horrida contremuere sub altis aetheris auris      in dubioque fuit sub utrorum regna cadendum      omnibus humanis esset terraque marique  of which we wish we could give our readers a more adequate translation than that by mr creech       when dreadful carthage frighted rome with arms      and all the world was shook with fierce alarms      whilst undecided yet which part should fall      which nation rise the glorious lord of all
now it is our purpose in the ensuing pages to pursue a contrary method
when any extraordinary scene presents itself as we trust will often be the case we shall spare no pains nor paper to open it at large to our reader but if whole years should pass without producing anything worthy his notice we shall not be afraid of a chasm in our history but shall hasten on to matters of consequence and leave such periods of time totally unobserved
these are indeed to be considered as blanks in the grand lottery of time
we therefore who are the registers of that lottery shall imitate those sagacious persons who deal in that which is drawn at guildhall and who never trouble the public with the many blanks they dispose of but when a great prize happens to be drawn the newspapers are presently filled with it and the world is sure to be informed at whose office it was sold indeed commonly two or three different offices lay claim to the honour of having disposed of it by which i suppose the adventurers are given to understand that certain brokers are in the secrets of fortune and indeed of her cabinet council
my reader then is not to be surprized if in the course of this work he shall find some chapters very short and others altogether as long some that contain only the time of a single day and others that comprise years in a word if my history sometimes seems to stand still and sometimes to fly
for all which i shall not look on myself as accountable to any court of critical jurisdiction whatever for as i am in reality the founder of a new province of writing so i am at liberty to make what laws i please therein
and these laws my readers whom i consider as my subjects are bound to believe in and to obey with which that they may readily and cheerfully comply i do hereby assure them that i shall principally regard their ease and advantage in all such institutions for i do not like a jure divino tyrant imagine that they are my slaves or my commodity
i am indeed set over them for their own good only and was created for their use and not they for mine
nor do i doubt while i make their interest the great rule of my writings they will unanimously concur in supporting my dignity and in rendering me all the honour i shall deserve or desire
chapter ii
religious cautions against showing too much favour to bastards and a great discovery made by mrs deborah wilkins
eight months after the celebration of the nuptials between captain blifil and miss bridget allworthy a young lady of great beauty merit and fortune was miss bridget by reason of a fright delivered of a fine boy
the child was indeed to all appearances perfect but the midwife discovered it was born a month before its full time
though the birth of an heir by his beloved sister was a circumstance of great joy to mr allworthy yet it did not alienate his affections from the little foundling to whom he had been godfather had given his own name of thomas and whom he had hitherto seldom failed of visiting at least once a day in his nursery
he told his sister if she pleased the newborn infant should be bred up together with little tommy to which she consented though with some little reluctance for she had truly a great complacence for her brother and hence she had always behaved towards the foundling with rather more kindness than ladies of rigid virtue can sometimes bring themselves to show to these children who however innocent may be truly called the living monuments of incontinence
the captain could not so easily bring himself to bear what he condemned as a fault in mr allworthy
he gave him frequent hints that to adopt the fruits of sin was to give countenance to it
he quoted several texts for he was well read in scripture such as he visits the sins of the fathers upon the children and the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edgec
whence he argued the legality of punishing the crime of the parent on the bastard
he said though the law did not positively allow the destroying such baseborn children yet it held them to be the children of nobody that the church considered them as the children of nobody and that at the best they ought to be brought up to the lowest and vilest offices of the commonwealth  mr allworthy answered to all this and much more which the captain had urged on this subject that however guilty the parents might be the children were certainly innocent that as to the texts he had quoted the former of them was a particular denunciation against the jews for the sin of idolatry of relinquishing and hating their heavenly king and the latter was parabolically spoken and rather intended to denote the certain and necessary consequences of sin than any express judgment against it
but to represent the almighty as avenging the sins of the guilty on the innocent was indecent if not blasphemous as it was to represent him acting against the first principles of natural justice and against the original notions of right and wrong which he himself had implanted in our minds by which we were to judge not only in all matters which were not revealed but even of the truth of revelation itself
he said he knew many held the same principles with the captain on this head but he was himself firmly convinced to the contrary and would provide in the same manner for this poor infant as if a legitimate child had had fortune to have been found in the same place  while the captain was taking all opportunities to press these and such like arguments to remove the little foundling from mr allworthy's of whose fondness for him he began to be jealous mrs deborah had made a discovery which in its event threatened at least to prove more fatal to poor tommy than all the reasonings of the captain
whether the insatiable curiosity of this good woman had carried her on to that business or whether she did it to confirm herself in the good graces of mrs blifil who notwithstanding her outward behaviour to the foundling frequently abused the infant in private and her brother too for his fondness to it i will not determine but she had now as she conceived fully detected the father of the foundling
now as this was a discovery of great consequence it may be necessary to trace it from the fountainhead
we shall therefore very minutely lay open those previous matters by which it was produced and for that purpose we shall be obliged to reveal all the secrets of a little family with which my reader is at present entirely unacquainted and of which the oeconomy was so rare and extraordinary that i fear it will shock the utmost credulity of many married persons
chapter iii
the description of a domestic government founded upon rules directly contrary to those of aristotle
my reader may please to remember he hath been informed that jenny jones had lived some years with a certain schoolmaster who had at her earnest desire instructed her in latin in which to do justice to her genius she had so improved herself that she was become a better scholar than her master
indeed though this poor man had undertaken a profession to which learning must be allowed necessary this was the least of his commendations
he was one of the bestnatured fellows in the world and was at the same time master of so much pleasantry and humour that he was reputed the wit of the country and all the neighbouring gentlemen were so desirous of his company that as denying was not his talent he spent much time at their houses which he might with more emolument have spent in his school
it may be imagined that a gentleman so qualified and so disposed was in no danger of becoming formidable to the learned seminaries of eton or westminster
to speak plainly his scholars were divided into two classes in the upper of which was a young gentleman the son of a neighbouring squire who at the age of seventeen was just entered into his syntaxis and in the lower was a second son of the same gentleman who together with seven parishboys was learning to read and write
the stipend arising hence would hardly have indulged the schoolmaster in the luxuries of life had he not added to this office those of clerk and barber and had not mr allworthy added to the whole an annuity of ten pounds which the poor man received every christmas and with which he was enabled to cheer his heart during that sacred festival
among his other treasures the pedagogue had a wife whom he had married out of mr allworthy's kitchen for her fortune viz twenty pounds which she had there amassed
this woman was not very amiable in her person
whether she sat to my friend hogarth or no i will not determine but she exactly resembled the young woman who is pouring out her mistress's tea in the third picture of the harlot's progress
she was besides a profest follower of that noble sect founded by xantippe of old by means of which she became more formidable in the school than her husband for to confess the truth he was never master there or anywhere else in her presence
though her countenance did not denote much natural sweetness of temper yet this was perhaps somewhat soured by a circumstance which generally poisons matrimonial felicity for children are rightly called the pledges of love and her husband though they had been married nine years had given her no such pledges a default for which he had no excuse either from age or health being not yet thirty years old and what they call a jolly brisk young man
hence arose another evil which produced no little uneasiness to the poor pedagogue of whom she maintained so constant a jealousy that he durst hardly speak to one woman in the parish for the least degree of civility or even correspondence with any female was sure to bring his wife upon her back and his own
in order to guard herself against matrimonial injuries in her own house as she kept one maidservant she always took care to chuse her out of that order of females whose faces are taken as a kind of security for their virtue of which number jenny jones as the reader hath been before informed was one
as the face of this young woman might be called pretty good security of the beforementioned kind and as her behaviour had been always extremely modest which is the certain consequence of understanding in women she had passed above four years at mr partridge's for that was the schoolmaster's name without creating the least suspicion in her mistress
nay she had been treated with uncommon kindness and her mistress had permitted mr partridge to give her those instructions which have been before commemorated
but it is with jealousy as with the gout when such distempers are in the blood there is never any security against their breaking out and that often on the slightest occasions and when least suspected
thus it happened to mrs partridge who had submitted four years to her husband's teaching this young woman and had suffered her often to neglect her work in order to pursue her learning
for passing by one day as the girl was reading and her master leaning over her the girl i know not for what reason suddenly started up from her chair and this was the first time that suspicion ever entered into the head of her mistress
this did not however at that time discover itself but lay lurking in her mind like a concealed enemy who waits for a reinforcement of additional strength before he openly declares himself and proceeds upon hostile operations and such additional strength soon arrived to corroborate her suspicion for not long after the husband and wife being at dinner the master said to his maid da mihi aliquid potum upon which the poor girl smiled perhaps at the badness of the latin and when her mistress cast her eyes on her blushed possibly with a consciousness of having laughed at her master
mrs partridge upon this immediately fell into a fury and discharged the trencher on which she was eating at the head of poor jenny crying out you impudent whore do you play tricks with my husband before my face and at the same instant rose from her chair with a knife in her hand with which most probably she would have executed very tragical vengeance had not the girl taken the advantage of being nearer the door than her mistress and avoided her fury by running away for as to the poor husband whether surprize had rendered him motionless or fear which is full as probable had restrained him from venturing at any opposition he sat staring and trembling in his chair nor did he once offer to move or speak till his wife returning from the pursuit of jenny made some defensive measures necessary for his own preservation and he likewise was obliged to retreat after the example of the maid
this good woman was no more than othello of a disposition              to make a life of jealousy      and follow still the changes of the moon      with fresh suspicions  with her as well as him            to be once in doubt      was once to be resolvd  she therefore ordered jenny immediately to pack up her alls and begone for that she was determined she should not sleep that night within her walls
mr partridge had profited too much by experience to interpose in a matter of this nature
he therefore had recourse to his usual receipt of patience for though he was not a great adept in latin he remembered and well understood the advice contained in these words       leve fit quod bene fertur onus  in english       a burden becomes lightest when it is well borne  which he had always in his mouth and of which to say the truth he had often occasion to experience the truth
jenny offered to make protestations of her innocence but the tempest was too strong for her to be heard
she then betook herself to the business of packing for which a small quantity of brown paper sufficed and having received her small pittance of wages she returned home
the schoolmaster and his consort passed their time unpleasantly enough that evening but something or other happened before the next morning which a little abated the fury of mrs partridge and she at length admitted her husband to make his excuses to which she gave the readier belief as he had instead of desiring her to recall jenny professed a satisfaction in her being dismissed saying she was grown of little use as a servant spending all her time in reading and was become moreover very pert and obstinate for indeed she and her master had lately had frequent disputes in literature in which as hath been said she was become greatly his superior
this however he would by no means allow and as he called her persisting in the right obstinacy he began to hate her with no small inveteracy
chapter iv
containing one of the most bloody battles or rather duels that were ever recorded in domestic history
for the reasons mentioned in the preceding chapter and from some other matrimonial concessions well known to most husbands and which like the secrets of freemasonry should be divulged to none who are not members of that honourable fraternity mrs partridge was pretty well satisfied that she had condemned her husband without cause and endeavoured by acts of kindness to make him amends for her false suspicion
her passions were indeed equally violent whichever way they inclined for as she could be extremely angry so could she be altogether as fond
but though these passions ordinarily succeed each other and scarce twentyfour hours ever passed in which the pedagogue was not in some degree the object of both yet on extraordinary occasions when the passion of anger had raged very high the remission was usually longer and so was the case at present for she continued longer in a state of affability after this fit of jealousy was ended than her husband had ever known before and had it not been for some little exercises which all the followers of xantippe are obliged to perform daily mr partridge would have enjoyed a perfect serenity of several months
perfect calms at sea are always suspected by the experienced mariner to be the forerunners of a storm and i know some persons who without being generally the devotees of superstition are apt to apprehend that great and unusual peace or tranquillity will be attended with its opposite
for which reason the antients used on such occasions to sacrifice to the goddess nemesis a deity who was thought by them to look with an invidious eye on human felicity and to have a peculiar delight in overturning it
as we are very far from believing in any such heathen goddess or from encouraging any superstition so we wish mr john fr or some other such philosopher would bestir himself a little in order to find out the real cause of this sudden transition from good to bad fortune which hath been so often remarked and of which we shall proceed to give an instance for it is our province to relate facts and we shall leave causes to persons of much higher genius
mankind have always taken great delight in knowing and descanting on the actions of others
hence there have been in all ages and nations certain places set apart for public rendezvous where the curious might meet and satisfy their mutual curiosity
among these the barbers' shops have justly borne the preeminence
among the greeks barbers' news was a proverbial expression and horace in one of his epistles makes honourable mention of the roman barbers in the same light
those of england are known to be no wise inferior to their greek or roman predecessors
you there see foreign affairs discussed in a manner little inferior to that with which they are handled in the coffeehouses and domestic occurrences are much more largely and freely treated in the former than in the latter
but this serves only for the men
now whereas the females of this country especially those of the lower order do associate themselves much more than those of other nations our polity would be highly deficient if they had not some place set apart likewise for the indulgence of their curiosity seeing they are in this no way inferior to the other half of the species
in enjoying therefore such place of rendezvous the british fair ought to esteem themselves more happy than any of their foreign sisters as i do not remember either to have read in history or to have seen in my travels anything of the like kind
this place then is no other than the chandler's shop the known seat of all the news or as it is vulgarly called gossiping in every parish in england
mrs partridge being one day at this assembly of females was asked by one of her neighbours if she had heard no news lately of jenny jones
to which she answered in the negative
upon this the other replied with a smile that the parish was very much obliged to her for having turned jenny away as she did
mrs partridge whose jealousy as the reader well knows was long since cured and who had no other quarrel to her maid answered boldly she did not know any obligation the parish had to her on that account for she believed jenny had scarce left her equal behind her
no truly said the gossip i hope not though i fancy we have sluts enow too
then you have not heard it seems that she hath been brought to bed of two bastards
but as they are not born here my husband and the other overseer says we shall not be obliged to keep them  two bastards answered mrs partridge hastily you surprize me
i don't know whether we must keep them but i am sure they must have been begotten here for the wench hath not been nine months gone away  nothing can be so quick and sudden as the operations of the mind especially when hope or fear or jealousy to which the two others are but journeymen set it to work
it occurred instantly to her that jenny had scarce ever been out of her own house while she lived with her
the leaning over the chair the sudden starting up the latin the smile and many other things rushed upon her all at once
the satisfaction her husband expressed in the departure of jenny appeared now to be only dissembled again in the same instant to be real but yet to confirm her jealousy proceeding from satiety and a hundred other bad causes
in a word she was convinced of her husband's guilt and immediately left the assembly in confusion
as fair grimalkin who though the youngest of the feline family degenerates not in ferocity from the elder branches of her house and though inferior in strength is equal in fierceness to the noble tiger himself when a little mouse whom it hath long tormented in sport escapes from her clutches for a while frets scolds growls swears but if the trunk or box behind which the mouse lay hid be again removed she flies like lightning on her prey and with envenomed wrath bites scratches mumbles and tears the little animal
not with less fury did mrs partridge fly on the poor pedagogue
her tongue teeth and hands fell all upon him at once
his wig was in an instant torn from his head his shirt from his back and from his face descended five streams of blood denoting the number of claws with which nature had unhappily armed the enemy
mr partridge acted for some time on the defensive only indeed he attempted only to guard his face with his hands but as he found that his antagonist abated nothing of her rage he thought he might at least endeavour to disarm her or rather to confine her arms in doing which her cap fell off in the struggle and her hair being too short to reach her shoulders erected itself on her head her stays likewise which were laced through one single hole at the bottom burst open and her breasts which were much more redundant than her hair hung down below her middle her face was likewise marked with the blood of her husband her teeth gnashed with rage and fire such as sparkles from a smith's forge darted from her eyes
so that altogether this amazonian heroine might have been an object of terror to a much bolder man than mr partridge
he had at length the good fortune by getting possession of her arms to render those weapons which she wore at the ends of her fingers useless which she no sooner perceived than the softness of her sex prevailed over her rage and she presently dissolved in tears which soon after concluded in a fit
that small share of sense which mr partridge had hitherto preserved through this scene of fury of the cause of which he was hitherto ignorant now utterly abandoned him
he ran instantly into the street hallowing out that his wife was in the agonies of death and beseeching the neighbours to fly with the utmost haste to her assistance
several good women obeyed his summons who entering his house and applying the usual remedies on such occasions mrs partridge was at length to the great joy of her husband brought to herself
as soon as she had a little recollected her spirits and somewhat composed herself with a cordial she began to inform the company of the manifold injuries she had received from her husband who she said was not contented to injure her in her bed but upon her upbraiding him with it had treated her in the cruelest manner imaginable had tore her cap and hair from her head and her stays from her body giving her at the same time several blows the marks of which she should carry to the grave
the poor man who bore on his face many more visible marks of the indignation of his wife stood in silent astonishment at this accusation which the reader will i believe bear witness for him had greatly exceeded the truth for indeed he had not struck her once and this silence being interpreted to be a confession of the charge by the whole court they all began at once una voce to rebuke and revile him repeating often that none but a coward ever struck a woman
mr partridge bore all this patiently but when his wife appealed to the blood on her face as an evidence of his barbarity he could not help laying claim to his own blood for so it really was as he thought it very unnatural that this should rise up as we are taught that of a murdered person often doth in vengeance against him
to this the women made no other answer than that it was a pity it had not come from his heart instead of his face all declaring that if their husbands should lift their hands against them they would have their hearts' bloods out of their bodies
after much admonition for what was past and much good advice to mr partridge for his future behaviour the company at length departed and left the husband and wife to a personal conference together in which mr partridge soon learned the cause of all his sufferings
chapter v  containing much matter to exercise the judgment and reflection of the reader
i believe it is a true observation that few secrets are divulged to one person only but certainly it would be next to a miracle that a fact of this kind should be known to a whole parish and not transpire any farther
and indeed a very few days had past before the country to use a common phrase rung of the schoolmaster of little baddington who was said to have beaten his wife in the most cruel manner
nay in some places it was reported he had murdered her in others that he had broke her arms in others her legs in short there was scarce an injury which can be done to a human creature but what mrs partridge was somewhere or other affirmed to have received from her husband
the cause of this quarrel was likewise variously reported for as some people said that mrs partridge had caught her husband in bed with his maid so many other reasons of a very different kind went abroad
nay some transferred the guilt to the wife and the jealousy to the husband
mrs wilkins had long ago heard of this quarrel but as a different cause from the true one had reached her ears she thought proper to conceal it and the rather perhaps as the blame was universally laid on mr partridge and his wife when she was servant to mr allworthy had in something offended mrs wilkins who was not of a very forgiving temper
but mrs wilkins whose eyes could see objects at a distance and who could very well look forward a few years into futurity had perceived a strong likelihood of captain blifil's being hereafter her master and as she plainly discerned that the captain bore no great goodwill to the little foundling she fancied it would be rendering him an agreeable service if she could make any discoveries that might lessen the affection which mr allworthy seemed to have contracted for this child and which gave visible uneasiness to the captain who could not entirely conceal it even before allworthy himself though his wife who acted her part much better in public frequently recommended to him her own example of conniving at the folly of her brother which she said she at least as well perceived and as much resented as any other possibly could
mrs wilkins having therefore by accident gotten a true scent of the above storythough long after it had happened failed not to satisfy herself thoroughly of all the particulars and then acquainted the captain that she had at last discovered the true father of the little bastard which she was sorry she said to see her master lose his reputation in the country by taking so much notice of
the captain chid her for the conclusion of her speech as an improper assurance in judging of her master's actions for if his honour or his understanding would have suffered the captain to make an alliance with mrs wilkins his pride would by no means have admitted it
and to say the truth there is no conduct less politic than to enter into any confederacy with your friend's servants against their master for by these means you afterwards become the slave of these very servants by whom you are constantly liable to be betrayed
and this consideration perhaps it was which prevented captain blifil from being more explicit with mrs wilkins or from encouraging the abuse which she had bestowed on allworthy
but though he declared no satisfaction to mrs wilkins at this discovery he enjoyed not a little from it in his own mind and resolved to make the best use of it he was able
he kept this matter a long time concealed within his own breast in hopes that mr allworthy might hear it from some other person but mrs wilkins whether she resented the captain's behaviour or whether his cunning was beyond her and she feared the discovery might displease him never afterwards opened her lips about the matter
i have thought it somewhat strange upon reflection that the housekeeper never acquainted mrs blifil with this news as women are more inclined to communicate all pieces of intelligence to their own sex than to ours
the only way as it appears to me of solving this difficulty is by imputing it to that distance which was now grown between the lady and the housekeeper whether this arose from a jealousy in mrs blifil that wilkins showed too great a respect to the foundling for while she was endeavouring to ruin the little infant in order to ingratiate herself with the captain she was every day more and more commending it before allworthy as his fondness for it every day increased
this notwithstanding all the care she took at other times to express the direct contrary to mrs blifil perhaps offended that delicate lady who certainly now hated mrs wilkins and though she did not or possibly could not absolutely remove her from her place she found however the means of making her life very uneasy
this mrs wilkins at length so resented that she very openly showed all manner of respect and fondness to little tommy in opposition to mrs blifil
the captain therefore finding the story in danger of perishing at last took an opportunity to reveal it himself
he was one day engaged with mr allworthy in a discourse on charity in which the captain with great learning proved to mr allworthy that the word charity in scripture nowhere means beneficence or generosity
the christian religion he said was instituted for much nobler purposes than to enforce a lesson which many heathen philosophers had taught us long before and which though it might perhaps be called a moral virtue savoured but little of that sublime christianlike disposition that vast elevation of thought in purity approaching to angelic perfection to be attained expressed and felt only by grace
those he said came nearer to the scripture meaning who understood by it candour or the forming of a benevolent opinion of our brethren and passing a favourable judgment on their actions a virtue much higher and more extensive in its nature than a pitiful distribution of alms which though we would never so much prejudice or even ruin our families could never reach many whereas charity in the other and truer sense might be extended to all mankind  he said considering who the disciples were it would be absurd to conceive the doctrine of generosity or giving alms to have been preached to them
and as we could not well imagine this doctrine should be preached by its divine author to men who could not practise it much less should we think it understood so by those who can practise it and do not
but though continued he there is i am afraid little merit in these benefactions there would i must confess be much pleasure in them to a good mind if it was not abated by one consideration
i mean that we are liable to be imposed upon and to confer our choicest favours often on the undeserving as you must own was your case in your bounty to that worthless fellow partridge for two or three such examples must greatly lessen the inward satisfaction which a good man would otherwise find in generosity nay may even make him timorous in bestowing lest he should be guilty of supporting vice and encouraging the wicked a crime of a very black dye and for which it will by no means be a sufficient excuse that we have not actually intended such an encouragement unless we have used the utmost caution in chusing the objects of our beneficence
a consideration which i make no doubt hath greatly checked the liberality of many a worthy and pious man  mr allworthy answered he could not dispute with the captain in the greek language and therefore could say nothing as to the true sense of the word which is translated charity but that he had always thought it was interpreted to consist in action and that giving alms constituted at least one branch of that virtue
as to the meritorious part he said he readily agreed with the captain for where could be the merit of barely discharging a duty
which he said let the word charity have what construction it would it sufficiently appeared to be from the whole tenor of the new testament
and as he thought it an indispensable duty enjoined both by the christian law and by the law of nature itself so was it withal so pleasant that if any duty could be said to be its own reward or to pay us while we are discharging it it was this
to confess the truth said he there is one degree of generosity of charity i would have called it which seems to have some show of merit and that is where from a principle of benevolence and christian love we bestow on another what we really want ourselves where in order to lessen the distresses of another we condescend to share some part of them by giving what even our own necessities cannot well spare
this is i think meritorious but to relieve our brethren only with our superfluities to be charitable i must use the word rather at the expense of our coffers than ourselves to save several families from misery rather than hang up an extraordinary picture in our houses or gratify any other idle ridiculous vanitythis seems to be only being human creatures
nay i will venture to go farther it is being in some degree epicures for what could the greatest epicure wish rather than to eat with many mouths instead of one
which i think may be predicated of any one who knows that the bread of many is owing to his own largesses
as to the apprehension of bestowing bounty on such as may hereafter prove unworthy objects because many have proved such surely it can never deter a good man from generosity
i do not think a few or many examples of ingratitude can justify a man's hardening his heart against the distresses of his fellowcreatures nor do i believe it can ever have such effect on a truly benevolent mind
nothing less than a persuasion of universal depravity can lock up the charity of a good man and this persuasion must lead him i think either into atheism or enthusiasm but surely it is unfair to argue such universal depravity from a few vicious individuals nor was this i believe ever done by a man who upon searching his own mind found one certain exception to the general rule he then concluded by asking who that partridge was whom he had called a worthless fellow  i mean said the captain partridge the barber the schoolmaster what do you call him
partridge the father of the little child which you found in your bed  mr allworthy exprest great surprize at this account and the captain as great at his ignorance of it for he said he had known it above a month and at length recollected with much difficulty that he was told it by mrs wilkins
upon this wilkins was immediately summoned who having confirmed what the captain had said was by mr allworthy by and with the captain's advice dispatched to little baddington to inform herself of the truth of the fact for the captain exprest great dislike at all hasty proceedings in criminal matters and said he would by no means have mr allworthy take any resolution either to the prejudice of the child or its father before he was satisfied that the latter was guilty for though he had privately satisfied himself of this from one of partridge's neighbours yet he was too generous to give any such evidence to mr allworthy
chapter vi
the trial of partridge the schoolmaster for incontinency the evidence of his wife a short reflection on the wisdom of our law with other grave matters which those will like best who understand them most
it may be wondered that a story so well known and which had furnished so much matter of conversation should never have been mentioned to mr allworthy himself who was perhaps the only person in that country who had never heard of it
to account in some measure for this to the reader i think proper to inform him that there was no one in the kingdom less interested in opposing that doctrine concerning the meaning of the word charity which hath been seen in the preceding chapter than our good man
indeed he was equally intitled to this virtue in either sense for as no man was ever more sensible of the wants or more ready to relieve the distresses of others so none could be more tender of their characters or slower to believe anything to their disadvantage
scandal therefore never found any access to his table for as it hath been long since observed that you may know a man by his companions so i will venture to say that by attending to the conversation at a great man's table you may satisfy yourself of his religion his politics his taste and indeed of his entire disposition for though a few odd fellows will utter their own sentiments in all places yet much the greater part of mankind have enough of the courtier to accommodate their conversation to the taste and inclination of their superiors
but to return to mrs wilkins who having executed her commission with great dispatch though at fifteen miles distance brought back such a confirmation of the schoolmaster's guilt that mr allworthy determined to send for the criminal and examine him viva voce
mr partridge therefore was summoned to attend in order to his defence if he could make any against this accusation
at the time appointed before mr allworthy himself at paradisehall came as well the said partridge with anne his wife as mrs wilkins his accuser
and now mr allworthy being seated in the chair of justice mr partridge was brought before him
having heard his accusation from the mouth of mrs wilkins he pleaded not guilty making many vehement protestations of his innocence
mrs partridge was then examined who after a modest apology for being obliged to speak the truth against her husband related all the circumstances with which the reader hath already been acquainted and at last concluded with her husband's confession of his guilt
whether she had forgiven him or no i will not venture to determine but it is certain she was an unwilling witness in this cause and it is probable from certain other reasons would never have been brought to depose as she did had not mrs wilkins with great art fished all out of her at her own house and had she not indeed made promises in mr allworthy's name that the punishment of her husband should not be such as might anywise affect his family
partridge still persisted in asserting his innocence though he admitted he had made the abovementioned confession which he however endeavoured to account for by protesting that he was forced into it by the continued importunity she used who vowed that as she was sure of his guilt she would never leave tormenting him till he had owned it and faithfully promised that in such case she would never mention it to him more
hence he said he had been induced falsely to confess himself guilty though he was innocent and that he believed he should have confest a murder from the same motive
mrs partridge could not bear this imputation with patience and having no other remedy in the present place but tears she called forth a plentiful assistance from them and then addressing herself to mr allworthy she said or rather cried may it please your worship there never was any poor woman so injured as i am by that base man for this is not the only instance of his falsehood to me
no may it please your worship he hath injured my bed many's the good time and often
i could have put up with his drunkenness and neglect of his business if he had not broke one of the sacred commandments
besides if it had been out of doors i had not mattered it so much but with my own servant in my own house under my own roof to defile my own chaste bed which to be sure he hath with his beastly stinking whores
yes you villain you have defiled my own bed you have and then you have charged me with bullocking you into owning the truth
it is very likely an't please your worship that i should bullock him
i have marks enow about my body to show of his cruelty to me
if you had been a man you villain you would have scorned to injure a woman in that manner
but you an't half a man you know it
nor have you been half a husband to me
you need run after whores you need when i'm sureand since he provokes me i am ready an't please your worship to take my bodily oath that i found them abed together
what you have forgot i suppose when you beat me into a fit and made the blood run down my forehead because i only civilly taxed you with adultery
but i can prove it by all my neighbours
you have almost broke my heart you have you have  here mr allworthy interrupted and begged her to be pacified promising her that she should have justice then turning to partridge who stood aghast one half of his wits being hurried away by surprize and the other half by fear he said he was sorry to see there was so wicked a man in the world
he assured him that his prevaricating and lying backward and forward was a great aggravation of his guilt for which the only atonement he could make was by confession and repentance
he exhorted him therefore to begin by immediately confessing the fact and not to persist in denying what was so plainly proved against him even by his own wife
here reader i beg your patience a moment while i make a just compliment to the great wisdom and sagacity of our law which refuses to admit the evidence of a wife for or against her husband
this says a certain learned author who i believe was never quoted before in any but a lawbook would be the means of creating an eternal dissension between them
it would indeed be the means of much perjury and of much whipping fining imprisoning transporting and hanging
partridge stood a while silent till being bid to speak he said he had already spoken the truth and appealed to heaven for his innocence and lastly to the girl herself whom he desired his worship immediately to send for for he was ignorant or at least pretended to be so that she had left that part of the country
mr allworthy whose natural love of justice joined to his coolness of temper made him always a most patient magistrate in hearing all the witnesses which an accused person could produce in his defence agreed to defer his final determination of this matter till the arrival of jenny for whom he immediately dispatched a messenger and then having recommended peace between partridge and his wife though he addressed himself chiefly to the wrong person he appointed them to attend again the third day for he had sent jenny a whole day's journey from his own house
at the appointed time the parties all assembled when the messenger returning brought word that jenny was not to be found for that she had left her habitation a few days before in company with a recruiting officer
mr allworthy then declared that the evidence of such a slut as she appeared to be would have deserved no credit but he said he could not help thinking that had she been present and would have declared the truth she must have confirmed what so many circumstances together with his own confession and the declaration of his wife that she had caught her husband in the fact did sufficiently prove
he therefore once more exhorted partridge to confess but he still avowing his innocence mr allworthy declared himself satisfied of his guilt and that he was too bad a man to receive any encouragement from him
he therefore deprived him of his annuity and recommended repentance to him on account of another world and industry to maintain himself and his wife in this
there were not perhaps many more unhappy persons than poor partridge
he had lost the best part of his income by the evidence of his wife and yet was daily upbraided by her for having among other things been the occasion of depriving her of that benefit but such was his fortune and he was obliged to submit to it
though i called him poor partridge in the last paragraph i would have the reader rather impute that epithet to the compassion in my temper than conceive it to be any declaration of his innocence
whether he was innocent or not will perhaps appear hereafter but if the historic muse hath entrusted me with any secrets i will by no means be guilty of discovering them till she shall give me leave
here therefore the reader must suspend his curiosity
certain it is that whatever was the truth of the case there was evidence more than sufficient to convict him before allworthy indeed much less would have satisfied a bench of justices on an order of bastardy and yet notwithstanding the positiveness of mrs partridge who would have taken the sacrament upon the matter there is a possibility that the schoolmaster was entirely innocent for though it appeared clear on comparing the time when jenny departed from little baddington with that of her delivery that she had there conceived this infant yet it by no means followed of necessity that partridge must have been its father for to omit other particulars there was in the same house a lad near eighteen between whom and jenny there had subsisted sufficient intimacy to found a reasonable suspicion and yet so blind is jealousy this circumstance never once entered into the head of the enraged wife
whether partridge repented or not according to mr allworthy's advice is not so apparent
certain it is that his wife repented heartily of the evidence she had given against him especially when she found mrs deborah had deceived her and refused to make any application to mr allworthy on her behalf
she had however somewhat better success with mrs blifil who was as the reader must have perceived a much bettertempered woman and very kindly undertook to solicit her brother to restore the annuity in which though goodnature might have some share yet a stronger and more natural motive will appear in the next chapter
these solicitations were nevertheless unsuccessful for though mr allworthy did not think with some late writers that mercy consists only in punishing offenders yet he was as far from thinking that it is proper to this excellent quality to pardon great criminals wantonly without any reason whatever
any doubtfulness of the fact or any circumstance of mitigation was never disregarded but the petitions of an offender or the intercessions of others did not in the least affect him
in a word he never pardoned because the offender himself or his friends were unwilling that he should be punished
partridge and his wife were therefore both obliged to submit to their fate which was indeed severe enough for so far was he from doubling his industry on the account of his lessened income that he did in a manner abandon himself to despair and as he was by nature indolent that vice now increased upon him by which means he lost the little school he had so that neither his wife nor himself would have had any bread to eat had not the charity of some good christian interposed and provided them with what was just sufficient for their sustenance
as this support was conveyed to them by an unknown hand they imagined and so i doubt not will the reader that mr allworthy himself was their secret benefactor who though he would not openly encourage vice could yet privately relieve the distresses of the vicious themselves when these became too exquisite and disproportionate to their demerit
in which light their wretchedness appeared now to fortune herself for she at length took pity on this miserable couple and considerably lessened the wretched state of partridge by putting a final end to that of his wife who soon after caught the smallpox and died
the justice which mr allworthy had executed on partridge at first met with universal approbation but no sooner had he felt its consequences than his neighbours began to relent and to compassionate his case and presently after to blame that as rigour and severity which they before called justice
they now exclaimed against punishing in cold blood and sang forth the praises of mercy and forgiveness
these cries were considerably increased by the death of mrs partridge which though owing to the distemper above mentioned which is no consequence of poverty or distress many were not ashamed to impute to mr allworthy's severity or as they now termed it cruelty
partridge having now lost his wife his school and his annuity and the unknown person having now discontinued the lastmentioned charity resolved to change the scene and left the country where he was in danger of starving with the universal compassion of all his neighbours
chapter vii
a short sketch of that felicity which prudent couples may extract from hatred with a short apology for those people who overlook imperfections in their friends
though the captain had effectually demolished poor partridge yet had he not reaped the harvest he hoped for which was to turn the foundling out of mr allworthy's house
on the contrary that gentleman grew every day fonder of little tommy as if he intended to counterbalance his severity to the father with extraordinary fondness and affection towards the son
this a good deal soured the captain's temper as did all the other daily instances of mr allworthy's generosity for he looked on all such largesses to be diminutions of his own wealth
in this we have said he did not agree with his wife nor indeed in anything else for though an affection placed on the understanding is by many wise persons thought more durable than that which is founded on beauty yet it happened otherwise in the present case
nay the understandings of this couple were their principal bone of contention and one great cause of many quarrels which from time to time arose between them and which at last ended on the side of the lady in a sovereign contempt for her husband and on the husband's in an utter abhorrence of his wife
as these had both exercised their talents chiefly in the study of divinity this was from their first acquaintance the most common topic of conversation between them
the captain like a wellbred man had before marriage always given up his opinion to that of the lady and this not in the clumsy awkward manner of a conceited blockhead who while he civilly yields to a superior in an argument is desirous of being still known to think himself in the right
the captain on the contrary though one of the proudest fellows in the world so absolutely yielded the victory to his antagonist that she who had not the least doubt of his sincerity retired always from the dispute with an admiration of her own understanding and a love for his
but though this complacence to one whom the captain thoroughly despised was not so uneasy to him as it would have been had any hopes of preferment made it necessary to show the same submission to a hoadley or to some other of great reputation in the science yet even this cost him too much to be endured without some motive
matrimony therefore having removed all such motives he grew weary of this condescension and began to treat the opinions of his wife with that haughtiness and insolence which none but those who deserve some contempt themselves can bestow and those only who deserve no contempt can bear
when the first torrent of tenderness was over and when in the calm and long interval between the fits reason began to open the eyes of the lady and she saw this alteration of behaviour in the captain who at length answered all her arguments only with pish and pshaw she was far from enduring the indignity with a tame submission
indeed it at first so highly provoked her that it might have produced some tragical event had it not taken a more harmless turn by filling her with the utmost contempt for her husband's understanding which somewhat qualified her hatred towards him though of this likewise she had a pretty moderate share
the captain's hatred to her was of a purer kind for as to any imperfections in her knowledge or understanding he no more despised her for them than for her not being six feet high
in his opinion of the female sex he exceeded the moroseness of aristotle himself he looked on a woman as on an animal of domestic use of somewhat higher consideration than a cat since her offices were of rather more importance but the difference between these two was in his estimation so small that in his marriage contracted with mr allworthy's lands and tenements it would have been pretty equal which of them he had taken into the bargain
and yet so tender was his pride that it felt the contempt which his wife now began to express towards him and this added to the surfeit he had before taken of her love created in him a degree of disgust and abhorrence perhaps hardly to be exceeded
one situation only of the married state is excluded from pleasure and that is a state of indifference but as many of my readers i hope know what an exquisite delight there is in conveying pleasure to a beloved object so some few i am afraid may have experienced the satisfaction of tormenting one we hate
it is i apprehend to come at this latter pleasure that we see both sexes often give up that ease in marriage which they might otherwise possess though their mate was never so disagreeable to them
hence the wife often puts on fits of love and jealousy nay even denies herself any pleasure to disturb and prevent those of her husband and he again in return puts frequent restraints on himself and stays at home in company which he dislikes in order to confine his wife to what she equally detests
hence too must flow those tears which a widow sometimes so plentifully sheds over the ashes of a husband with whom she led a life of constant disquiet and turbulency and whom now she can never hope to torment any more
but if ever any couple enjoyed this pleasure it was at present experienced by the captain and his lady
it was always a sufficient reason to either of them to be obstinate in any opinion that the other had previously asserted the contrary
if the one proposed any amusement the other constantly objected to it they never loved or hated commended or abused the same person
and for this reason as the captain looked with an evil eye on the little foundling his wife began now to caress it almost equally with her own child
the reader will be apt to conceive that this behaviour between the husband and wife did not greatly contribute to mr allworthy's repose as it tended so little to that serene happiness which he had designed for all three from this alliance but the truth is though he might be a little disappointed in his sanguine expectations yet he was far from being acquainted with the whole matter for as the captain was from certain obvious reasons much on his guard before him the lady was obliged for fear of her brother's displeasure to pursue the same conduct
in fact it is possible for a third person to be very intimate nay even to live long in the same house with a married couple who have any tolerable discretion and not even guess at the sour sentiments which they bear to each other for though the whole day may be sometimes too short for hatred as well as for love yet the many hours which they naturally spend together apart from all observers furnish people of tolerable moderation with such ample opportunity for the enjoyment of either passion that if they love they can support being a few hours in company without toying or if they hate without spitting in each other's faces
it is possible however that mr allworthy saw enough to render him a little uneasy for we are not always to conclude that a wise man is not hurt because he doth not cry out and lament himself like those of a childish or effeminate temper
but indeed it is possible he might see some faults in the captain without any uneasiness at all for men of true wisdom and goodness are contented to take persons and things as they are without complaining of their imperfections or attempting to amend them
they can see a fault in a friend a relation or an acquaintance without ever mentioning it to the parties themselves or to any others and this often without lessening their affection
indeed unless great discernment be tempered with this overlooking disposition we ought never to contract friendship but with a degree of folly which we can deceive for i hope my friends will pardon me when i declare i know none of them without a fault and i should be sorry if i could imagine i had any friend who could not see mine
forgiveness of this kind we give and demand in turn
it is an exercise of friendship and perhaps none of the least pleasant
and this forgiveness we must bestow without desire of amendment
there is perhaps no surer mark of folly than an attempt to correct the natural infirmities of those we love
the finest composition of human nature as well as the finest china may have a flaw in it and this i am afraid in either case is equally incurable though nevertheless the pattern may remain of the highest value
upon the whole then mr allworthy certainly saw some imperfections in the captain but as this was a very artful man and eternally upon his guard before him these appeared to him no more than blemishes in a good character which his goodness made him overlook and his wisdom prevented him from discovering to the captain himself
very different would have been his sentiments had he discovered the whole which perhaps would in time have been the case had the husband and wife long continued this kind of behaviour to each other but this kind fortune took effectual means to prevent by forcing the captain to do that which rendered him again dear to his wife and restored all her tenderness and affection towards him
chapter viii
a receipt to regain the lost affections of a wife which hath never been known to fail in the most desperate cases
the captain was made large amends for the unpleasant minutes which he passed in the conversation of his wife and which were as few as he could contrive to make them by the pleasant meditations he enjoyed when alone
these meditations were entirely employed on mr allworthy's fortune for first he exercised much thought in calculating as well as he could the exact value of the whole which calculations he often saw occasion to alter in his own favour and secondly and chiefly he pleased himself with intended alterations in the house and gardens and in projecting many other schemes as well for the improvement of the estate as of the grandeur of the place for this purpose he applied himself to the studies of architecture and gardening and read over many books on both these subjects for these sciences indeed employed his whole time and formed his only amusement
he at last completed a most excellent plan and very sorry we are that it is not in our power to present it to our reader since even the luxury of the present age i believe would hardly match it
it had indeed in a superlative degree the two principal ingredients which serve to recommend all great and noble designs of this nature for it required an immoderate expense to execute and a vast length of time to bring it to any sort of perfection
the former of these the immense wealth of which the captain supposed mr allworthy possessed and which he thought himself sure of inheriting promised very effectually to supply and the latter the soundness of his own constitution and his time of life which was only what is called middleage removed all apprehension of his not living to accomplish
nothing was wanting to enable him to enter upon the immediate execution of this plan but the death of mr allworthy in calculating which he had employed much of his own algebra besides purchasing every book extant that treats of the value of lives reversions c from all which he satisfied himself that as he had every day a chance of this happening so had he more than an even chance of its happening within a few years
but while the captain was one day busied in deep contemplations of this kind one of the most unlucky as well as unseasonable accidents happened to him
the utmost malice of fortune could indeed have contrived nothing so cruel so malapropos so absolutely destructive to all his schemes
in short not to keep the reader in long suspense just at the very instant when his heart was exulting in meditations on the happiness which would accrue to him by mr allworthy's death he himselfdied of an apoplexy
this unfortunately befel the captain as he was taking his evening walk by himself so that nobody was present to lend him any assistance if indeed any assistance could have preserved him
he took therefore measure of that proportion of soil which was now become adequate to all his future purposes and he lay dead on the ground a great though not a living example of the truth of that observation of horace          tu secanda marmora         locas sub ipsum funus et sepulchri         immemor struis domos  which sentiment i shall thus give to the english reader you provide the noblest materials for building when a pickaxe and a spade are only necessary and build houses of five hundred by a hundred feet forgetting that of six by two    chapter ix
a proof of the infallibility of the foregoing receipt in the lamentations of the widow with other suitable decorations of death such as physicians c and an epitaph in the true stile
mr allworthy his sister and another lady were assembled at the accustomed hour in the supperroom where having waited a considerable time longer than usual mr allworthy first declared he began to grow uneasy at the captain's stay for he was always most punctual at his meals and gave orders that the bell should be rung without the doors and especially towards those walks which the captain was wont to use
all these summons proving ineffectual for the captain had by perverse accident betaken himself to a new walk that evening mrs blifil declared she was seriously frightened
upon which the other lady who was one of her most intimate acquaintance and who well knew the true state of her affections endeavoured all she could to pacify her telling herto be sure she could not help being uneasy but that she should hope the best
that perhaps the sweetness of the evening had inticed the captain to go farther than his usual walk or he might be detained at some neighbour's
mrs blifil answered no she was sure some accident had befallen him for that he would never stay out without sending her word as he must know how uneasy it would make her
the other lady having no other arguments to use betook herself to the entreaties usual on such occasions and begged her not to frighten herself for it might be of very ill consequence to her own health and filling out a very large glass of wine advised and at last prevailed with her to drink it
mr allworthy now returned into the parlour for he had been himself in search after the captain
his countenance sufficiently showed the consternation he was under which indeed had a good deal deprived him of speech but as grief operates variously on different minds so the same apprehension which depressed his voice elevated that of mrs blifil
she now began to bewail herself in very bitter terms and floods of tears accompanied her lamentations which the lady her companion declared she could not blame but at the same time dissuaded her from indulging attempting to moderate the grief of her friend by philosophical observations on the many disappointments to which human life is daily subject which she said was a sufficient consideration to fortify our minds against any accidents how sudden or terrible soever
she said her brother's example ought to teach her patience who though indeed he could not be supposed as much concerned as herself yet was doubtless very uneasy though his resignation to the divine will had restrained his grief within due bounds
mention not my brother said mrs blifil i alone am the object of your pity
what are the terrors of friendship to what a wife feels on these occasions
oh he is lost
somebody hath murdered himi shall never see him morehere a torrent of tears had the same consequence with what the suppression had occasioned to mr allworthy and she remained silent
at this interval a servant came running in out of breath and cried out the captain was found and before he could proceed farther he was followed by two more bearing the dead body between them
here the curious reader may observe another diversity in the operations of grief for as mr allworthy had been before silent from the same cause which had made his sister vociferous so did the present sight which drew tears from the gentleman put an entire stop to those of the lady who first gave a violent scream and presently after fell into a fit
the room was soon full of servants some of whom with the lady visitant were employed in care of the wife and others with mr allworthy assisted in carrying off the captain to a warm bed where every method was tried in order to restore him to life
and glad should we be could we inform the reader that both these bodies had been attended with equal success for those who undertook the care of the lady succeeded so well that after the fit had continued a decent time she again revived to their great satisfaction but as to the captain all experiments of bleeding chafing dropping c proved ineffectual
death that inexorable judge had passed sentence on him and refused to grant him a reprieve though two doctors who arrived and were fee'd at one and the same instant were his counsel
these two doctors whom to avoid any malicious applications we shall distinguish by the names of dr y and dr z having felt his pulse to wit dr y his right arm and dr z his left both agreed that he was absolutely dead but as to the distemper or cause of his death they differed dr y holding that he died of an apoplexy and dr z of an epilepsy
hence arose a dispute between the learned men in which each delivered the reasons of their several opinions
these were of such equal force that they served both to confirm either doctor in his own sentiments and made not the least impression on his adversary
to say the truth every physician almost hath his favourite disease to which he ascribes all the victories obtained over human nature
the gout the rheumatism the stone the gravel and the consumption have all their several patrons in the faculty and none more than the nervous fever or the fever on the spirits
and here we may account for those disagreements in opinion concerning the cause of a patient's death which sometimes occur between the most learned of the college and which have greatly surprized that part of the world who have been ignorant of the fact we have above asserted
the reader may perhaps be surprized that instead of endeavouring to revive the patient the learned gentlemen should fall immediately into a dispute on the occasion of his death but in reality all such experiments had been made before their arrival for the captain was put into a warm bed had his veins scarified his forehead chafed and all sorts of strong drops applied to his lips and nostrils
the physicians therefore finding themselves anticipated in everything they ordered were at a loss how to apply that portion of time which it is usual and decent to remain for their fee and were therefore necessitated to find some subject or other for discourse and what could more naturally present itself than that before mentioned
our doctors were about to take their leave when mr allworthy having given over the captain and acquiesced in the divine will began to enquire after his sister whom he desired them to visit before their departure
this lady was now recovered of her fit and to use the common phrase as well as could be expected for one in her condition
the doctors therefore all previous ceremonies being complied with as this was a new patient attended according to desire and laid hold on each of her hands as they had before done on those of the corpse
the case of the lady was in the other extreme from that of her husband for as he was past all the assistance of physic so in reality she required none
there is nothing more unjust than the vulgar opinion by which physicians are misrepresented as friends to death
on the contrary i believe if the number of those who recover by physic could be opposed to that of the martyrs to it the former would rather exceed the latter
nay some are so cautious on this head that to avoid a possibility of killing the patient they abstain from all methods of curing and prescribe nothing but what can neither do good nor harm
i have heard some of these with great gravity deliver it as a maxim that nature should be left to do her own work while the physician stands by as it were to clap her on the back and encourage her when she doth well  so little then did our doctors delight in death that they discharged the corpse after a single fee but they were not so disgusted with their living patient concerning whose case they immediately agreed and fell to prescribing with great diligence
whether as the lady had at first persuaded her physicians to believe her ill they had now in return persuaded her to believe herself so i will not determine but she continued a whole month with all the decorations of sickness
during this time she was visited by physicians attended by nurses and received constant messages from her acquaintance to enquire after her health
at length the decent time for sickness and immoderate grief being expired the doctors were discharged and the lady began to see company being altered only from what she was before by that colour of sadness in which she had dressed her person and countenance
the captain was now interred and might perhaps have already made a large progress towards oblivion had not the friendship of mr allworthy taken care to preserve his memory by the following epitaph which was written by a man of as great genius as integrity and one who perfectly well knew the captain
here lies                   in expectation of a joyful rising                              the body of                           captain john blifil

book iii
containing the most memorable transactions which passed in the family of mr allworthy from the time when tommy jones arrived at the age of fourteen till he attained the age of nineteen
in this book the reader may pick up some hints concerning the education of children
chapter i
containing little or nothing
the reader will be pleased to remember that at the beginning of the second book of this history we gave him a hint of our intention to pass over several large periods of time in which nothing happened worthy of being recorded in a chronicle of this kind
in so doing we do not only consult our own dignity and ease but the good and advantage of the reader for besides that by these means we prevent him from throwing away his time in reading without either pleasure or emolument we give him at all such seasons an opportunity of employing that wonderful sagacity of which he is master by filling up these vacant spaces of time with his own conjectures for which purpose we have taken care to qualify him in the preceding pages
for instance what reader but knows that mr allworthy felt at first for the loss of his friend those emotions of grief which on such occasions enter into all men whose hearts are not composed of flint or their heads of as solid materials
again what reader doth not know that philosophy and religion in time moderated and at last extinguished this grief
the former of these teaching the folly and vanity of it and the latter correcting it as unlawful and at the same time assuaging it by raising future hopes and assurances which enable a strong and religious mind to take leave of a friend on his deathbed with little less indifference than if he was preparing for a long journey and indeed with little less hope of seeing him again
nor can the judicious reader be at a greater loss on account of mrs bridget blifil who he may be assured conducted herself through the whole season in which grief is to make its appearance on the outside of the body with the strictest regard to all the rules of custom and decency suiting the alterations of her countenance to the several alterations of her habit for as this changed from weeds to black from black to grey from grey to white so did her countenance change from dismal to sorrowful from sorrowful to sad and from sad to serious till the day came in which she was allowed to return to her former serenity
we have mentioned these two as examples only of the task which may be imposed on readers of the lowest class
much higher and harder exercises of judgment and penetration may reasonably be expected from the upper graduates in criticism
many notable discoveries will i doubt not be made by such of the transactions which happened in the family of our worthy man during all the years which we have thought proper to pass over for though nothing worthy of a place in this history occurred within that period yet did several incidents happen of equal importance with those reported by the daily and weekly historians of the age in reading which great numbers of persons consume a considerable part of their time very little i am afraid to their emolument
now in the conjectures here proposed some of the most excellent faculties of the mind may be employed to much advantage since it is a more useful capacity to be able to foretel the actions of men in any circumstance from their characters than to judge of their characters from their actions
the former i own requires the greater penetration but may be accomplished by true sagacity with no less certainty than the latter
as we are sensible that much the greatest part of our readers are very eminently possessed of this quality we have left them a space of twelve years to exert it in and shall now bring forth our heroe at about fourteen years of age not questioning that many have been long impatient to be introduced to his acquaintance
chapter ii
the heroe of this great history appears with very bad omens
a little tale of so low a kind that some may think it not worth their notice
a word or two concerning a squire and more relating to a gamekeeper and a schoolmaster
as we determined when we first sat down to write this history to flatter no man but to guide our pen throughout by the directions of truth we are obliged to bring our heroe on the stage in a much more disadvantageous manner than we could wish and to declare honestly even at his first appearance that it was the universal opinion of all mr allworthy's family that he was certainly born to be hanged
indeed i am sorry to say there was too much reason for this conjecture the lad having from his earliest years discovered a propensity to many vices and especially to one which hath as direct a tendency as any other to that fate which we have just now observed to have been prophetically denounced against him he had been already convicted of three robberies viz of robbing an orchard of stealing a duck out of a farmer's yard and of picking master blifil's pocket of a ball
the vices of this young man were moreover heightened by the disadvantageous light in which they appeared when opposed to the virtues of master blifil his companion a youth of so different a cast from little jones that not only the family but all the neighbourhood resounded his praises
he was indeed a lad of a remarkable disposition sober discreet and pious beyond his age qualities which gained him the love of every one who knew him while tom jones was universally disliked and many expressed their wonder that mr allworthy would suffer such a lad to be educated with his nephew lest the morals of the latter should be corrupted by his example
an incident which happened about this time will set the characters of these two lads more fairly before the discerning reader than is in the power of the longest dissertation
tom jones who bad as he is must serve for the heroe of this history had only one friend among all the servants of the family for as to mrs wilkins she had long since given him up and was perfectly reconciled to her mistress
this friend was the gamekeeper a fellow of a loose kind of disposition and who was thought not to entertain much stricter notions concerning the difference of meum and tuum than the young gentleman himself
and hence this friendship gave occasion to many sarcastical remarks among the domestics most of which were either proverbs before or at least are become so now and indeed the wit of them all may be comprised in that short latin proverb noscitur a socio which i think is thus expressed in english you may know him by the company he keeps  to say the truth some of that atrocious wickedness in jones of which we have just mentioned three examples might perhaps be derived from the encouragement he had received from this fellow who in two or three instances had been what the law calls an accessary after the fact for the whole duck and great part of the apples were converted to the use of the gamekeeper and his family though as jones alone was discovered the poor lad bore not only the whole smart but the whole blame both which fell again to his lot on the following occasion
contiguous to mr allworthy's estate was the manor of one of those gentlemen who are called preservers of the game
this species of men from the great severity with which they revenge the death of a hare or partridge might be thought to cultivate the same superstition with the bannians in india many of whom we are told dedicate their whole lives to the preservation and protection of certain animals was it not that our english bannians while they preserve them from other enemies will most unmercifully slaughter whole horseloads themselves so that they stand clearly acquitted of any such heathenish superstition
i have indeed a much better opinion of this kind of men than is entertained by some as i take them to answer the order of nature and the good purposes for which they were ordained in a more ample manner than many others
now as horace tells us that there are a set of human beings             fruges consumere nati  born to consume the fruits of the earth so i make no manner of doubt but that there are others            feras consumere nati  born to consume the beasts of the field or as it is commonly called the game and none i believe will deny but that those squires fulfil this end of their creation
little jones went one day a shooting with the gamekeeper when happening to spring a covey of partridges near the border of that manor over which fortune to fulfil the wise purposes of nature had planted one of the game consumers the birds flew into it and were marked as it is called by the two sportsmen in some furze bushes about two or three hundred paces beyond mr allworthy's dominions
mr allworthy had given the fellow strict orders on pain of forfeiting his place never to trespass on any of his neighbours no more on those who were less rigid in this matter than on the lord of this manor
with regard to others indeed these orders had not been always very scrupulously kept but as the disposition of the gentleman with whom the partridges had taken sanctuary was well known the gamekeeper had never yet attempted to invade his territories
nor had he done it now had not the younger sportsman who was excessively eager to pursue the flying game overpersuaded him but jones being very importunate the other who was himself keen enough after the sport yielded to his persuasions entered the manor and shot one of the partridges
the gentleman himself was at that time on horseback at a little distance from them and hearing the gun go off he immediately made towards the place and discovered poor tom for the gamekeeper had leapt into the thickest part of the furzebrake where he had happily concealed himself
the gentleman having searched the lad and found the partridge upon him denounced great vengeance swearing he would acquaint mr allworthy
he was as good as his word for he rode immediately to his house and complained of the trespass on his manor in as high terms and as bitter language as if his house had been broken open and the most valuable furniture stole out of it
he added that some other person was in his company though he could not discover him for that two guns had been discharged almost in the same instant
and says he we have found only this partridge but the lord knows what mischief they have done  at his return home tom was presently convened before mr allworthy
he owned the fact and alledged no other excuse but what was really true viz that the covey was originally sprung in mr allworthy's own manor
tom was then interrogated who was with him which mr allworthy declared he was resolved to know acquainting the culprit with the circumstance of the two guns which had been deposed by the squire and both his servants but tom stoutly persisted in asserting that he was alone yet to say the truth he hesitated a little at first which would have confirmed mr allworthy's belief had what the squire and his servants said wanted any further confirmation
the gamekeeper being a suspected person was now sent for and the question put to him but he relying on the promise which tom had made him to take all upon himself very resolutely denied being in company with the young gentleman or indeed having seen him the whole afternoon
mr allworthy then turned towards tom with more than usual anger in his countenance and advised him to confess who was with him repeating that he was resolved to know
the lad however still maintained his resolution and was dismissed with much wrath by mr allworthy who told him he should have to the next morning to consider of it when he should be questioned by another person and in another manner
poor jones spent a very melancholy night and the more so as he was without his usual companion for master blifil was gone abroad on a visit with his mother
fear of the punishment he was to suffer was on this occasion his least evil his chief anxiety being lest his constancy should fail him and he should be brought to betray the gamekeeper whose ruin he knew must now be the consequence
nor did the gamekeeper pass his time much better
he had the same apprehensions with the youth for whose honour he had likewise a much tenderer regard than for his skin
in the morning when tom attended the reverend mr thwackum the person to whom mr allworthy had committed the instruction of the two boys he had the same questions put to him by that gentleman which he had been asked the evening before to which he returned the same answers
the consequence of this was so severe a whipping that it possibly fell little short of the torture with which confessions are in some countries extorted from criminals
tom bore his punishment with great resolution and though his master asked him between every stroke whether he would not confess he was contented to be flead rather than betray his friend or break the promise he had made
the gamekeeper was now relieved from his anxiety and mr allworthy himself began to be concerned at tom's sufferings for besides that mr thwackum being highly enraged that he was not able to make the boy say what he himself pleased had carried his severity much beyond the good man's intention this latter began now to suspect that the squire had been mistaken which his extreme eagerness and anger seemed to make probable and as for what the servants had said in confirmation of their master's account he laid no great stress upon that
now as cruelty and injustice were two ideas of which mr allworthy could by no means support the consciousness a single moment he sent for tom and after many kind and friendly exhortations said i am convinced my dear child that my suspicions have wronged you i am sorry that you have been so severely punished on this account and at last gave him a little horse to make him amends again repeating his sorrow for what had past
tom's guilt now flew in his face more than any severity could make it
he could more easily bear the lashes of thwackum than the generosity of allworthy
the tears burst from his eyes and he fell upon his knees crying oh sir you are too good to me
indeed you are
indeed i don't deserve it and at that very instant from the fulness of his heart had almost betrayed the secret but the good genius of the gamekeeper suggested to him what might be the consequence to the poor fellow and this consideration sealed his lips
thwackum did all he could to persuade allworthy from showing any compassion or kindness to the boy saying he had persisted in an untruth and gave some hints that a second whipping might probably bring the matter to light
but mr allworthy absolutely refused to consent to the experiment
he said the boy had suffered enough already for concealing the truth even if he was guilty seeing that he could have no motive but a mistaken point of honour for so doing
honour cryed thwackum with some warmth mere stubbornness and obstinacy
can honour teach any one to tell a lie or can any honour exist independent of religion  this discourse happened at table when dinner was just ended and there were present mr allworthy mr thwackum and a third gentleman who now entered into the debate and whom before we proceed any further we shall briefly introduce to our reader's acquaintance
chapter iii
the character of mr square the philosopher and of mr thwackum the divine with a dispute concerning   the name of this gentleman who had then resided some time at mr allworthy's house was mr square
his natural parts were not of the first rate but he had greatly improved them by a learned education
he was deeply read in the antients and a profest master of all the works of plato and aristotle
upon which great models he had principally formed himself sometimes according with the opinion of the one and sometimes with that of the other
in morals he was a profest platonist and in religion he inclined to be an aristotelian
but though he had as we have said formed his morals on the platonic model yet he perfectly agreed with the opinion of aristotle in considering that great man rather in the quality of a philosopher or a speculatist than as a legislator
this sentiment he carried a great way indeed so far as to regard all virtue as matter of theory only
this it is true he never affirmed as i have heard to any one and yet upon the least attention to his conduct i cannot help thinking it was his real opinion as it will perfectly reconcile some contradictions which might otherwise appear in his character
this gentleman and mr thwackum scarce ever met without a disputation for their tenets were indeed diametrically opposite to each other
square held human nature to be the perfection of all virtue and that vice was a deviation from our nature in the same manner as deformity of body is
thwackum on the contrary maintained that the human mind since the fall was nothing but a sink of iniquity till purified and redeemed by grace
in one point only they agreed which was in all their discourses on morality never to mention the word goodness
the favourite phrase of the former was the natural beauty of virtue that of the latter was the divine power of grace
the former measured all actions by the unalterable rule of right and the eternal fitness of things the latter decided all matters by authority but in doing this he always used the scriptures and their commentators as the lawyer doth his coke upon lyttleton where the comment is of equal authority with the text
after this short introduction the reader will be pleased to remember that the parson had concluded his speech with a triumphant question to which he had apprehended no answer viz can any honour exist independent on religion
to this square answered that it was impossible to discourse philosophically concerning words till their meaning was first established that there were scarce any two words of a more vague and uncertain signification than the two he had mentioned for that there were almost as many different opinions concerning honour as concerning religion
but says he if by honour you mean the true natural beauty of virtue i will maintain it may exist independent of any religion whatever
nay added he you yourself will allow it may exist independent of all but one so will a mahometan a jew and all the maintainers of all the different sects in the world  thwackum replied this was arguing with the usual malice of all the enemies to the true church
he said he doubted not but that all the infidels and hereticks in the world would if they could confine honour to their own absurd errors and damnable deceptions but honour says he is not therefore manifold because there are many absurd opinions about it nor is religion manifold because there are various sects and heresies in the world
when i mention religion i mean the christian religion and not only the christian religion but the protestant religion and not only the protestant religion but the church of england
and when i mention honour i mean that mode of divine grace which is not only consistent with but dependent upon this religion and is consistent with and dependent upon no other
now to say that the honour i here mean and which was i thought all the honour i could be supposed to mean will uphold much less dictate an untruth is to assert an absurdity too shocking to be conceived  i purposely avoided says square drawing a conclusion which i thought evident from what i have said but if you perceived it i am sure you have not attempted to answer it
however to drop the article of religion i think it is plain from what you have said that we have different ideas of honour or why do we not agree in the same terms of its explanation
i have asserted that true honour and true virtue are almost synonymous terms and they are both founded on the unalterable rule of right and the eternal fitness of things to which an untruth being absolutely repugnant and contrary it is certain that true honour cannot support an untruth
in this therefore i think we are agreed but that this honour can be said to be founded on religion to which it is antecedent if by religion be meant any positive law  i agree answered thwackum with great warmth with a man who asserts honour to be antecedent to religion
mr allworthy did i agree  he was proceeding when mr allworthy interposed telling them very coldly they had both mistaken his meaning for that he had said nothing of true honourit is possible however he would not have easily quieted the disputants who were growing equally warm had not another matter now fallen out which put a final end to the conversation at present
chapter iv
containing a necessary apology for the author and a childish incident which perhaps requires an apology likewise
before i proceed farther i shall beg leave to obviate some misconstructions into which the zeal of some few readers may lead them for i would not willingly give offence to any especially to men who are warm in the cause of virtue or religion
i hope therefore no man will by the grossest misunderstanding or perversion of my meaning misrepresent me as endeavouring to cast any ridicule on the greatest perfections of human nature and which do indeed alone purify and ennoble the heart of man and raise him above the brute creation
this reader i will venture to say and by how much the better man you are yourself by so much the more will you be inclined to believe me that i would rather have buried the sentiments of these two persons in eternal oblivion than have done any injury to either of these glorious causes
on the contrary it is with a view to their service that i have taken upon me to record the lives and actions of two of their false and pretended champions
a treacherous friend is the most dangerous enemy and i will say boldly that both religion and virtue have received more real discredit from hypocrites than the wittiest profligates or infidels could ever cast upon them nay farther as these two in their purity are rightly called the bands of civil society and are indeed the greatest of blessings so when poisoned and corrupted with fraud pretence and affectation they have become the worst of civil curses and have enabled men to perpetrate the most cruel mischiefs to their own species
indeed i doubt not but this ridicule will in general be allowed my chief apprehension is as many true and just sentiments often came from the mouths of these persons lest the whole should be taken together and i should be conceived to ridicule all alike
now the reader will be pleased to consider that as neither of these men were fools they could not be supposed to have holden none but wrong principles and to have uttered nothing but absurdities what injustice therefore must i have done to their characters had i selected only what was bad
and how horribly wretched and maimed must their arguments have appeared
upon the whole it is not religion or virtue but the want of them which is here exposed
had not thwackum too much neglected virtue and square religion in the composition of their several systems and had not both utterly discarded all natural goodness of heart they had never been represented as the objects of derision in this history in which we will now proceed
this matter then which put an end to the debate mentioned in the last chapter was no other than a quarrel between master blifil and tom jones the consequence of which had been a bloody nose to the former for though master blifil notwithstanding he was the younger was in size above the other's match yet tom was much his superior at the noble art of boxing
tom however cautiously avoided all engagements with that youth for besides that tommy jones was an inoffensive lad amidst all his roguery and really loved blifil mr thwackum being always the second of the latter would have been sufficient to deter him
but well says a certain author no man is wise at all hours it is therefore no wonder that a boy is not so
a difference arising at play between the two lads master blifil called tom a beggarly bastard
upon which the latter who was somewhat passionate in his disposition immediately caused that phenomenon in the face of the former which we have above remembered
master blifil now with his blood running from his nose and the tears galloping after from his eyes appeared before his uncle and the tremendous thwackum
in which court an indictment of assault battery and wounding was instantly preferred against tom who in his excuse only pleaded the provocation which was indeed all the matter that master blifil had omitted
it is indeed possible that this circumstance might have escaped his memory for in his reply he positively insisted that he had made use of no such appellation adding heaven forbid such naughty words should ever come out of his mouth  tom though against all form of law rejoined in affirmance of the words
upon which master blifil said it is no wonder
those who will tell one fib will hardly stick at another
if i had told my master such a wicked fib as you have done i should be ashamed to show my face  what fib child cries thwackum pretty eagerly
why he told you that nobody was with him a shooting when he killed the partridge but he knows here he burst into a flood of tears yes he knows for he confessed it to me that black george the gamekeeper was there
nay he saidyes you diddeny it if you can that you would not have confest the truth though master had cut you to pieces  at this the fire flashed from thwackum's eyes and he cried out in triumphoh
ho
this is your mistaken notion of honour
this is the boy who was not to be whipped again but mr allworthy with a more gentle aspect turned towards the lad and said is this true child
how came you to persist so obstinately in a falsehood  tom said he scorned a lie as much as any one but he thought his honour engaged him to act as he did for he had promised the poor fellow to conceal him which he said he thought himself farther obliged to as the gamekeeper had begged him not to go into the gentleman's manor and had at last gone himself in compliance with his persuasions he said this was the whole truth of the matter and he would take his oath of it and concluded with very passionately begging mr allworthy to have compassion on the poor fellow's family especially as he himself only had been guilty and the other had been very difficultly prevailed on to do what he did
indeed sir said he it could hardly be called a lie that i told for the poor fellow was entirely innocent of the whole matter
i should have gone alone after the birds nay i did go at first and he only followed me to prevent more mischief
do pray sir let me be punished take my little horse away again but pray sir forgive poor george  mr allworthy hesitated a few moments and then dismissed the boys advising them to live more friendly and peaceably together
chapter v  the opinions of the divine and the philosopher concerning the two boys with some reasons for their opinions and other matters
it is probable that by disclosing this secret which had been communicated in the utmost confidence to him young blifil preserved his companion from a good lashing for the offence of the bloody nose would have been of itself sufficient cause for thwackum to have proceeded to correction but now this was totally absorbed in the consideration of the other matter and with regard to this mr allworthy declared privately he thought the boy deserved reward rather than punishment so that thwackum's hand was withheld by a general pardon
thwackum whose meditations were full of birch exclaimed against this weak and as he said he would venture to call it wicked lenity
to remit the punishment of such crimes was he said to encourage them
he enlarged much on the correction of children and quoted many texts from solomon and others which being to be found in so many other books shall not be found here
he then applied himself to the vice of lying on which head he was altogether as learned as he had been on the other
square said he had been endeavouring to reconcile the behaviour of tom with his idea of perfect virtue but could not
he owned there was something which at first sight appeared like fortitude in the action but as fortitude was a virtue and falsehood a vice they could by no means agree or unite together
he added that as this was in some measure to confound virtue and vice it might be worth mr thwackum's consideration whether a larger castigation might not be laid on upon the account
as both these learned men concurred in censuring jones so were they no less unanimous in applauding master blifil
to bring truth to light was by the parson asserted to be the duty of every religious man and by the philosopher this was declared to be highly conformable with the rule of right and the eternal and unalterable fitness of things
all this however weighed very little with mr allworthy
he could not be prevailed on to sign the warrant for the execution of jones
there was something within his own breast with which the invincible fidelity which that youth had preserved corresponded much better than it had done with the religion of thwackum or with the virtue of square
he therefore strictly ordered the former of these gentlemen to abstain from laying violent hands on tom for what had past
the pedagogue was obliged to obey those orders but not without great reluctance and frequent mutterings that the boy would be certainly spoiled
towards the gamekeeper the good man behaved with more severity
he presently summoned that poor fellow before him and after many bitter remonstrances paid him his wages and dismist him from his service for mr allworthy rightly observed that there was a great difference between being guilty of a falsehood to excuse yourself and to excuse another
he likewise urged as the principal motive to his inflexible severity against this man that he had basely suffered tom jones to undergo so heavy a punishment for his sake whereas he ought to have prevented it by making the discovery himself
when this story became public many people differed from square and thwackum in judging the conduct of the two lads on the occasion
master blifil was generally called a sneaking rascal a poorspirited wretch with other epithets of the like kind whilst tom was honoured with the appellations of a brave lad a jolly dog and an honest fellow
indeed his behaviour to black george much ingratiated him with all the servants for though that fellow was before universally disliked yet he was no sooner turned away than he was as universally pitied and the friendship and gallantry of tom jones was celebrated by them all with the highest applause and they condemned master blifil as openly as they durst without incurring the danger of offending his mother
for all this however poor tom smarted in the flesh for though thwackum had been inhibited to exercise his arm on the foregoing account yet as the proverb says it is easy to find a stick c so was it easy to find a rod and indeed the not being able to find one was the only thing which could have kept thwackum any long time from chastising poor jones
had the bare delight in the sport been the only inducement to the pedagogue it is probable master blifil would likewise have had his share but though mr allworthy had given him frequent orders to make no difference between the lads yet was thwackum altogether as kind and gentle to this youth as he was harsh nay even barbarous to the other
to say the truth blifil had greatly gained his master's affections partly by the profound respect he always showed his person but much more by the decent reverence with which he received his doctrine for he had got by heart and frequently repeated his phrases and maintained all his master's religious principles with a zeal which was surprizing in one so young and which greatly endeared him to the worthy preceptor
tom jones on the other hand was not only deficient in outward tokens of respect often forgetting to pull off his hat or to bow at his master's approach but was altogether as unmindful both of his master's precepts and example
he was indeed a thoughtless giddy youth with little sobriety in his manners and less in his countenance and would often very impudently and indecently laugh at his companion for his serious behaviour
mr square had the same reason for his preference of the former lad for tom jones showed no more regard to the learned discourses which this gentleman would sometimes throw away upon him than to those of thwackum
he once ventured to make a jest of the rule of right and at another time said he believed there was no rule in the world capable of making such a man as his father for so mr allworthy suffered himself to be called
master blifil on the contrary had address enough at sixteen to recommend himself at one and the same time to both these opposites
with one he was all religion with the other he was all virtue
and when both were present he was profoundly silent which both interpreted in his favour and in their own
nor was blifil contented with flattering both these gentlemen to their faces he took frequent occasions of praising them behind their backs to allworthy before whom when they two were alone and his uncle commended any religious or virtuous sentiment for many such came constantly from him he seldom failed to ascribe it to the good instructions he had received from either thwackum or square for he knew his uncle repeated all such compliments to the persons for whose use they were meant and he found by experience the great impressions which they made on the philosopher as well as on the divine for to say the truth there is no kind of flattery so irresistible as this at second hand
the young gentleman moreover soon perceived how extremely grateful all those panegyrics on his instructors were to mr allworthy himself as they so loudly resounded the praise of that singular plan of education which he had laid down for this worthy man having observed the imperfect institution of our public schools and the many vices which boys were there liable to learn had resolved to educate his nephew as well as the other lad whom he had in a manner adopted in his own house where he thought their morals would escape all that danger of being corrupted to which they would be unavoidably exposed in any public school or university
having therefore determined to commit these boys to the tuition of a private tutor mr thwackum was recommended to him for that office by a very particular friend of whose understanding mr allworthy had a great opinion and in whose integrity he placed much confidence
this thwackum was fellow of a college where he almost entirely resided and had a great reputation for learning religion and sobriety of manners
and these were doubtless the qualifications by which mr allworthy's friend had been induced to recommend him though indeed this friend had some obligations to thwackum's family who were the most considerable persons in a borough which that gentleman represented in parliament
thwackum at his first arrival was extremely agreeable to allworthy and indeed he perfectly answered the character which had been given of him
upon longer acquaintance however and more intimate conversation this worthy man saw infirmities in the tutor which he could have wished him to have been without though as those seemed greatly overbalanced by his good qualities they did not incline mr allworthy to part with him nor would they indeed have justified such a proceeding for the reader is greatly mistaken if he conceives that thwackum appeared to mr allworthy in the same light as he doth to him in this history and he is as much deceived if he imagines that the most intimate acquaintance which he himself could have had with that divine would have informed him of those things which we from our inspiration are enabled to open and discover
of readers who from such conceits as these condemn the wisdom or penetration of mr allworthy i shall not scruple to say that they make a very bad and ungrateful use of that knowledge which we have communicated to them
these apparent errors in the doctrine of thwackum served greatly to palliate the contrary errors in that of square which our good man no less saw and condemned
he thought indeed that the different exuberancies of these gentlemen would correct their different imperfections and that from both especially with his assistance the two lads would derive sufficient precepts of true religion and virtue
if the event happened contrary to his expectations this possibly proceeded from some fault in the plan itself which the reader hath my leave to discover if he can for we do not pretend to introduce any infallible characters into this history where we hope nothing will be found which hath never yet been seen in human nature
to return therefore the reader will not i think wonder that the different behaviour of the two lads above commemorated produced the different effects of which he hath already seen some instance and besides this there was another reason for the conduct of the philosopher and the pedagogue but this being matter of great importance we shall reveal it in the next chapter
chapter vi
containing a better reason still for the beforementioned opinions
it is to be known then that those two learned personages who have lately made a considerable figure on the theatre of this history had from their first arrival at mr allworthy's house taken so great an affection the one to his virtue the other to his religion that they had meditated the closest alliance with him
for this purpose they had cast their eyes on that fair widow whom though we have not for some time made any mention of her the reader we trust hath not forgot
mrs blifil was indeed the object to which they both aspired
it may seem remarkable that of four persons whom we have commemorated at mr allworthy's house three of them should fix their inclinations on a lady who was never greatly celebrated for her beauty and who was moreover now a little descended into the vale of years but in reality bosom friends and intimate acquaintance have a kind of natural propensity to particular females at the house of a friendviz to his grandmother mother sister daughter aunt niece or cousin when they are rich and to his wife sister daughter niece cousin mistress or servantmaid if they should be handsome
we would not however have our reader imagine that persons of such characters as were supported by thwackum and square would undertake a matter of this kind which hath been a little censured by some rigid moralists before they had thoroughly examined it and considered whether it was as shakespear phrases it stuff o' th' conscience  or no
thwackum was encouraged to the undertaking by reflecting that to covet your neighbour's sister is nowhere forbidden and he knew it was a rule in the construction of all laws that expressum facit cessare tacitum the sense of which is when a lawgiver sets down plainly his whole meaning we are prevented from making him mean what we please ourselves as some instances of women therefore are mentioned in the divine law which forbids us to covet our neighbour's goods and that of a sister omitted he concluded it to be lawful
and as to square who was in his person what is called a jolly fellow or a widow's man he easily reconciled his choice to the eternal fitness of things
now as both of these gentlemen were industrious in taking every opportunity of recommending themselves to the widow they apprehended one certain method was by giving her son the constant preference to the other lad and as they conceived the kindness and affection which mr allworthy showed the latter must be highly disagreeable to her they doubted not but the laying hold on all occasions to degrade and vilify him would be highly pleasing to her who as she hated the boy must love all those who did him any hurt
in this thwackum had the advantage for while square could only scarify the poor lad's reputation he could flea his skin and indeed he considered every lash he gave him as a compliment paid to his mistress so that he could with the utmost propriety repeat this old flogging line castigo te non quod odio habeam sed quod amem
i chastise thee not out of hatred but out of love and this indeed he often had in his mouth or rather according to the old phrase never more properly applied at his fingers' ends
for this reason principally the two gentlemen concurred as we have seen above in their opinion concerning the two lads this being indeed almost the only instance of their concurring on any point for beside the difference of their principles they had both long ago strongly suspected each other's design and hated one another with no little degree of inveteracy
this mutual animosity was a good deal increased by their alternate successes for mrs blifil knew what they would be at long before they imagined it or indeed intended she should for they proceeded with great caution lest she should be offended and acquaint mr allworthy
but they had no reason for any such fear she was well enough pleased with a passion of which she intended none should have any fruits but herself
and the only fruits she designed for herself were flattery and courtship for which purpose she soothed them by turns and a long time equally
she was indeed rather inclined to favour the parson's principles but square's person was more agreeable to her eye for he was a comely man whereas the pedagogue did in countenance very nearly resemble that gentleman who in the harlot's progress is seen correcting the ladies in bridewell
whether mrs blifil had been surfeited with the sweets of marriage or disgusted by its bitters or from what other cause it proceeded i will not determine but she could never be brought to listen to any second proposals
however she at last conversed with square with such a degree of intimacy that malicious tongues began to whisper things of her to which as well for the sake of the lady as that they were highly disagreeable to the rule of right and the fitness of things we will give no credit and therefore shall not blot our paper with them
the pedagogue 'tis certain whipped on without getting a step nearer to his journey's end
indeed he had committed a great error and that square discovered much sooner than himself
mrs blifil as perhaps the reader may have formerly guessed was not over and above pleased with the behaviour of her husband nay to be honest she absolutely hated him till his death at last a little reconciled him to her affections
it will not be therefore greatly wondered at if she had not the most violent regard to the offspring she had by him
and in fact she had so little of this regard that in his infancy she seldom saw her son or took any notice of him and hence she acquiesced after a little reluctance in all the favours which mr allworthy showered on the foundling whom the good man called his own boy and in all things put on an entire equality with master blifil
this acquiescence in mrs blifil was considered by the neighbours and by the family as a mark of her condescension to her brother's humour and she was imagined by all others as well as thwackum and square to hate the foundling in her heart nay the more civility she showed him the more they conceived she detested him and the surer schemes she was laying for his ruin for as they thought it her interest to hate him it was very difficult for her to persuade them she did not
thwackum was the more confirmed in his opinion as she had more than once slily caused him to whip tom jones when mr allworthy who was an enemy to this exercise was abroad whereas she had never given any such orders concerning young blifil
and this had likewise imposed upon square
in reality though she certainly hated her own sonof which however monstrous it appears i am assured she is not a singular instanceshe appeared notwithstanding all her outward compliance to be in her heart sufficiently displeased with all the favour shown by mr allworthy to the foundling
she frequently complained of this behind her brother's back and very sharply censured him for it both to thwackum and square nay she would throw it in the teeth of allworthy himself when a little quarrel or miff as it is vulgarly called arose between them
however when tom grew up and gave tokens of that gallantry of temper which greatly recommends men to women this disinclination which she had discovered to him when a child by degrees abated and at last she so evidently demonstrated her affection to him to be much stronger than what she bore her own son that it was impossible to mistake her any longer
she was so desirous of often seeing him and discovered such satisfaction and delight in his company that before he was eighteen years old he was become a rival to both square and thwackum and what is worse the whole country began to talk as loudly of her inclination to tom as they had before done of that which she had shown to square on which account the philosopher conceived the most implacable hatred for our poor heroe
chapter vii
in which the author himself makes his appearance on the stage
though mr allworthy was not of himself hasty to see things in a disadvantageous light and was a stranger to the public voice which seldom reaches to a brother or a husband though it rings in the ears of all the neighbourhood yet was this affection of mrs blifil to tom and the preference which she too visibly gave him to her own son of the utmost disadvantage to that youth
for such was the compassion which inhabited mr allworthy's mind that nothing but the steel of justice could ever subdue it
to be unfortunate in any respect was sufficient if there was no demerit to counterpoise it to turn the scale of that good man's pity and to engage his friendship and his benefaction
when therefore he plainly saw master blifil was absolutely detested for that he was by his own mother he began on that account only to look with an eye of compassion upon him and what the effects of compassion are in good and benevolent minds i need not here explain to most of my readers
henceforward he saw every appearance of virtue in the youth through the magnifying end and viewed all his faults with the glass inverted so that they became scarce perceptible
and this perhaps the amiable temper of pity may make commendable but the next step the weakness of human nature alone must excuse for he no sooner perceived that preference which mrs blifil gave to tom than that poor youth however innocent began to sink in his affections as he rose in hers
this it is true would of itself alone never have been able to eradicate jones from his bosom but it was greatly injurious to him and prepared mr allworthy's mind for those impressions which afterwards produced the mighty events that will be contained hereafter in this history and to which it must be confest the unfortunate lad by his own wantonness wildness and want of caution too much contributed
in recording some instances of these we shall if rightly understood afford a very useful lesson to those welldisposed youths who shall hereafter be our readers for they may here find that goodness of heart and openness of temper though these may give them great comfort within and administer to an honest pride in their own minds will by no means alas
do their business in the world
prudence and circumspection are necessary even to the best of men
they are indeed as it were a guard to virtue without which she can never be safe
it is not enough that your designs nay that your actions are intrinsically good you must take care they shall appear so
if your inside be never so beautiful you must preserve a fair outside also
this must be constantly looked to or malice and envy will take care to blacken it so that the sagacity and goodness of an allworthy will not be able to see through it and to discern the beauties within
let this my young readers be your constant maxim that no man can be good enough to enable him to neglect the rules of prudence nor will virtue herself look beautiful unless she be bedecked with the outward ornaments of decency and decorum
and this precept my worthy disciples if you read with due attention you will i hope find sufficiently enforced by examples in the following pages
i ask pardon for this short appearance by way of chorus on the stage
it is in reality for my own sake that while i am discovering the rocks on which innocence and goodness often split i may not be misunderstood to recommend the very means to my worthy readers by which i intend to show them they will be undone
and this as i could not prevail on any of my actors to speak i myself was obliged to declare
chapter viii
a childish incident in which however is seen a goodnatured disposition in tom jones
the reader may remember that mr allworthy gave tom jones a little horse as a kind of smartmoney for the punishment which he imagined he had suffered innocently
this horse tom kept above half a year and then rode him to a neighbouring fair and sold him
at his return being questioned by thwackum what he had done with the money for which the horse was sold he frankly declared he would not tell him
oho says thwackum you will not
then i will have it out of your brh that being the place to which he always applied for information on every doubtful occasion
tom was now mounted on the back of a footman and everything prepared for execution when mr allworthy entering the room gave the criminal a reprieve and took him with him into another apartment where being alone with tom he put the same question to him which thwackum had before asked him
tom answered he could in duty refuse him nothing but as for that tyrannical rascal he would never make him any other answer than with a cudgel with which he hoped soon to be able to pay him for all his barbarities
mr allworthy very severely reprimanded the lad for his indecent and disrespectful expressions concerning his master but much more for his avowing an intention of revenge
he threatened him with the entire loss of his favour if he ever heard such another word from his mouth for he said he would never support or befriend a reprobate
by these and the like declarations he extorted some compunction from tom in which that youth was not oversincere for he really meditated some return for all the smarting favours he had received at the hands of the pedagogue
he was however brought by mr allworthy to express a concern for his resentment against thwackum and then the good man after some wholesome admonition permitted him to proceed which he did as follows  indeed my dear sir i love and honour you more than all the world i know the great obligations i have to you and should detest myself if i thought my heart was capable of ingratitude
could the little horse you gave me speak i am sure he could tell you how fond i was of your present for i had more pleasure in feeding him than in riding him
indeed sir it went to my heart to part with him nor would i have sold him upon any other account in the world than what i did
you yourself sir i am convinced in my case would have done the same for none ever so sensibly felt the misfortunes of others
what would you feel dear sir if you thought yourself the occasion of them
indeed sir there never was any misery like theirs  like whose child says allworthy what do you mean  oh sir answered tom your poor gamekeeper with all his large family ever since your discarding him have been perishing with all the miseries of cold and hunger i could not bear to see these poor wretches naked and starving and at the same time know myself to have been the occasion of all their sufferings
i could not bear it sir upon my soul i could not here the tears ran down his cheeks and he thus proceeded
it was to save them from absolute destruction i parted with your dear present notwithstanding all the value i had for it i sold the horse for them and they have every farthing of the money  mr allworthy now stood silent for some moments and before he spoke the tears started from his eyes
he at length dismissed tom with a gentle rebuke advising him for the future to apply to him in cases of distress rather than to use extraordinary means of relieving them himself
this affair was afterwards the subject of much debate between thwackum and square
thwackum held that this was flying in mr allworthy's face who had intended to punish the fellow for his disobedience
he said in some instances what the world called charity appeared to him to be opposing the will of the almighty which had marked some particular persons for destruction and that this was in like manner acting in opposition to mr allworthy concluding as usual with a hearty recommendation of birch
square argued strongly on the other side in opposition perhaps to thwackum or in compliance with mr allworthy who seemed very much to approve what jones had done
as to what he urged on this occasion as i am convinced most of my readers will be much abler advocates for poor jones it would be impertinent to relate it
indeed it was not difficult to reconcile to the rule of right an action which it would have been impossible to deduce from the rule of wrong
chapter ix
containing an incident of a more heinous kind with the comments of thwackum and square
it hath been observed by some man of much greater reputation for wisdom than myself that misfortunes seldom come single
an instance of this may i believe be seen in those gentlemen who have the misfortune to have any of their rogueries detected for here discovery seldom stops till the whole is come out
thus it happened to poor tom who was no sooner pardoned for selling the horse than he was discovered to have some time before sold a fine bible which mr allworthy gave him the money arising from which sale he had disposed of in the same manner
this bible master blifil had purchased though he had already such another of his own partly out of respect for the book and partly out of friendship to tom being unwilling that the bible should be sold out of the family at halfprice
he therefore deposited the said halfprice himself for he was a very prudent lad and so careful of his money that he had laid up almost every penny which he had received from mr allworthy
some people have been noted to be able to read in no book but their own
on the contrary from the time when master blifil was first possessed of this bible he never used any other
nay he was seen reading in it much oftener than he had before been in his own
now as he frequently asked thwackum to explain difficult passages to him that gentleman unfortunately took notice of tom's name which was written in many parts of the book
this brought on an inquiry which obliged master blifil to discover the whole matter
thwackum was resolved a crime of this kind which he called sacrilege should not go unpunished
he therefore proceeded immediately to castigation and not contented with that he acquainted mr allworthy at their next meeting with this monstrous crime as it appeared to him inveighing against tom in the most bitter terms and likening him to the buyers and sellers who were driven out of the temple
square saw this matter in a very different light
he said he could not perceive any higher crime in selling one book than in selling another
that to sell bibles was strictly lawful by all laws both divine and human and consequently there was no unfitness in it
he told thwackum that his great concern on this occasion brought to his mind the story of a very devout woman who out of pure regard to religion stole tillotson's sermons from a lady of her acquaintance
this story caused a vast quantity of blood to rush into the parson's face which of itself was none of the palest and he was going to reply with great warmth and anger had not mrs blifil who was present at this debate interposed
that lady declared herself absolutely of mr square's side
she argued indeed very learnedly in support of his opinion and concluded with saying if tom had been guilty of any fault she must confess her own son appeared to be equally culpable for that she could see no difference between the buyer and the seller both of whom were alike to be driven out of the temple
mrs blifil having declared her opinion put an end to the debate
square's triumph would almost have stopt his words had he needed them and thwackum who for reasons beforementioned durst not venture at disobliging the lady was almost choaked with indignation
as to mr allworthy he said since the boy had been already punished he would not deliver his sentiments on the occasion and whether he was or was not angry with the lad i must leave to the reader's own conjecture
soon after this an action was brought against the gamekeeper by squire western the gentleman in whose manor the partridge was killed for depredations of the like kind
this was a most unfortunate circumstance for the fellow as it not only of itself threatened his ruin but actually prevented mr allworthy from restoring him to his favour for as that gentleman was walking out one evening with master blifil and young jones the latter slily drew him to the habitation of black george where the family of that poor wretch namely his wife and children were found in all the misery with which cold hunger and nakedness can affect human creatures for as to the money they had received from jones former debts had consumed almost the whole
such a scene as this could not fail of affecting the heart of mr allworthy
he immediately gave the mother a couple of guineas with which he bid her cloath her children
the poor woman burst into tears at this goodness and while she was thanking him could not refrain from expressing her gratitude to tom who had she said long preserved both her and hers from starving
we have not says she had a morsel to eat nor have these poor children had a rag to put on but what his goodness hath bestowed on us for indeed besides the horse and the bible tom had sacrificed a nightgown and other things to the use of this distressed family
on their return home tom made use of all his eloquence to display the wretchedness of these people and the penitence of black george himself and in this he succeeded so well that mr allworthy said he thought the man had suffered enough for what was past that he would forgive him and think of some means of providing for him and his family
jones was so delighted with this news that though it was dark when they returned home he could not help going back a mile in a shower of rain to acquaint the poor woman with the glad tidings but like other hasty divulgers of news he only brought on himself the trouble of contradicting it for the ill fortune of black george made use of the very opportunity of his friend's absence to overturn all again
chapter x
in which master blifil and jones appear in different lights
master blifil fell very short of his companion in the amiable quality of mercy but he as greatly exceeded him in one of a much higher kind namely in justice in which he followed both the precepts and example of thwackum and square for though they would both make frequent use of the word mercy yet it was plain that in reality square held it to be inconsistent with the rule of right and thwackum was for doing justice and leaving mercy to heaven
the two gentlemen did indeed somewhat differ in opinion concerning the objects of this sublime virtue by which thwackum would probably have destroyed one half of mankind and square the other half
master blifil then though he had kept silence in the presence of jones yet when he had better considered the matter could by no means endure the thought of suffering his uncle to confer favours on the undeserving
he therefore resolved immediately to acquaint him with the fact which we have above slightly hinted to the readers
the truth of which was as follows  the gamekeeper about a year after he was dismissed from mr allworthy's service and before tom's selling the horse being in want of bread either to fill his own mouth or those of his family as he passed through a field belonging to mr western espied a hare sitting in her form
this hare he had basely and barbarously knocked on the head against the laws of the land and no less against the laws of sportsmen
the higgler to whom the hare was sold being unfortunately taken many months after with a quantity of game upon him was obliged to make his peace with the squire by becoming evidence against some poacher
and now black george was pitched upon by him as being a person already obnoxious to mr western and one of no good fame in the country
he was besides the best sacrifice the higgler could make as he had supplied him with no game since and by this means the witness had an opportunity of screening his better customers for the squire being charmed with the power of punishing black george whom a single transgression was sufficient to ruin made no further enquiry
had this fact been truly laid before mr allworthy it might probably have done the gamekeeper very little mischief
but there is no zeal blinder than that which is inspired with the love of justice against offenders
master blifil had forgot the distance of the time
he varied likewise in the manner of the fact and by the hasty addition of the single letter s he considerably altered the story for he said that george had wired hares
these alterations might probably have been set right had not master blifil unluckily insisted on a promise of secrecy from mr allworthy before he revealed the matter to him but by that means the poor gamekeeper was condemned without having an opportunity to defend himself for as the fact of killing the hare and of the action brought were certainly true mr allworthy had no doubt concerning the rest
shortlived then was the joy of these poor people for mr allworthy the next morning declared he had fresh reason without assigning it for his anger and strictly forbad tom to mention george any more though as for his family he said he would endeavour to keep them from starving but as to the fellow himself he would leave him to the laws which nothing could keep him from breaking
tom could by no means divine what had incensed mr allworthy for of master blifil he had not the least suspicion
however as his friendship was to be tired out by no disappointments he now determined to try another method of preserving the poor gamekeeper from ruin
jones was lately grown very intimate with mr western
he had so greatly recommended himself to that gentleman by leaping over fivebarred gates and by other acts of sportsmanship that the squire had declared tom would certainly make a great man if he had but sufficient encouragement
he often wished he had himself a son with such parts and one day very solemnly asserted at a drinking bout that tom should hunt a pack of hounds for a thousand pound of his money with any huntsman in the whole country
by such kind of talents he had so ingratiated himself with the squire that he was a most welcome guest at his table and a favourite companion in his sport everything which the squire held most dear to wit his guns dogs and horses were now as much at the command of jones as if they had been his own
he resolved therefore to make use of this favour on behalf of his friend black george whom he hoped to introduce into mr western's family in the same capacity in which he had before served mr allworthy
the reader if he considers that this fellow was already obnoxious to mr western and if he considers farther the weighty business by which that gentleman's displeasure had been incurred will perhaps condemn this as a foolish and desperate undertaking but if he should totally condemn young jones on that account he will greatly applaud him for strengthening himself with all imaginable interest on so arduous an occasion
for this purpose then tom applied to mr western's daughter a young lady of about seventeen years of age whom her father next after those necessary implements of sport just before mentioned loved and esteemed above all the world
now as she had some influence on the squire so tom had some little influence on her
but this being the intended heroine of this work a lady with whom we ourselves are greatly in love and with whom many of our readers will probably be in love too before we part it is by no means proper she should make her appearance at the end of a book
book iv
containing the time of a year
chapter i
containing five pages of paper
as truth distinguishes our writings from those idle romances which are filled with monsters the productions not of nature but of distempered brains and which have been therefore recommended by an eminent critic to the sole use of the pastrycook so on the other hand we would avoid any resemblance to that kind of history which a celebrated poet seems to think is no less calculated for the emolument of the brewer as the reading it should be always attended with a tankard of good ale       whilehistory with her comrade ale      soothes the sad series of her serious tale  for as this is the liquor of modern historians nay perhaps their muse if we may believe the opinion of butler who attributes inspiration to ale it ought likewise to be the potation of their readers since every book ought to be read with the same spirit and in the same manner as it is writ
thus the famous author of hurlothrumbo told a learned bishop that the reason his lordship could not taste the excellence of his piece was that he did not read it with a fiddle in his hand which instrument he himself had always had in his own when he composed it
that our work therefore might be in no danger of being likened to the labours of these historians we have taken every occasion of interspersing through the whole sundry similes descriptions and other kind of poetical embellishments
these are indeed designed to supply the place of the said ale and to refresh the mind whenever those slumbers which in a long work are apt to invade the reader as well as the writer shall begin to creep upon him
without interruptions of this kind the best narrative of plain matter of fact must overpower every reader for nothing but the ever lasting watchfulness which homer has ascribed only to jove himself can be proof against a newspaper of many volumes
we shall leave to the reader to determine with what judgment we have chosen the several occasions for inserting those ornamental parts of our work
surely it will be allowed that none could be more proper than the present where we are about to introduce a considerable character on the scene no less indeed than the heroine of this heroic historical prosaic poem
here therefore we have thought proper to prepare the mind of the reader for her reception by filling it with every pleasing image which we can draw from the face of nature
and for this method we plead many precedents
first this is an art well known to and much practised by our tragick poets who seldom fail to prepare their audience for the reception of their principal characters
thus the heroe is always introduced with a flourish of drums and trumpets in order to rouse a martial spirit in the audience and to accommodate their ears to bombast and fustian which mr locke's blind man would not have grossly erred in likening to the sound of a trumpet
again when lovers are coming forth soft music often conducts them on the stage either to soothe the audience with the softness of the tender passion or to lull and prepare them for that gentle slumber in which they will most probably be composed by the ensuing scene
and not only the poets but the masters of these poets the managers of playhouses seem to be in this secret for besides the aforesaid kettledrums c which denote the heroe's approach he is generally ushered on the stage by a large troop of half a dozen sceneshifters and how necessary these are imagined to his appearance may be concluded from the following theatrical story  king pyrrhus was at dinner at an alehouse bordering on the theatre when he was summoned to go on the stage
the heroe being unwilling to quit his shoulder of mutton and as unwilling to draw on himself the indignation of mr wilks his brothermanager for making the audience wait had bribed these his harbingers to be out of the way
while mr wilks therefore was thundering out where are the carpenters to walk on before king pyrrhus that monarch very quietly eat his mutton and the audience however impatient were obliged to entertain themselves with music in his absence
to be plain i much question whether the politician who hath generally a good nose hath not scented out somewhat of the utility of this practice
i am convinced that awful magistrate my lordmayor contracts a good deal of that reverence which attends him through the year by the several pageants which precede his pomp
nay i must confess that even i myself who am not remarkably liable to be captivated with show have yielded not a little to the impressions of much preceding state
when i have seen a man strutting in a procession after others whose business was only to walk before him i have conceived a higher notion of his dignity than i have felt on seeing him in a common situation
but there is one instance which comes exactly up to my purpose
this is the custom of sending on a basketwoman who is to precede the pomp at a coronation and to strew the stage with flowers before the great personages begin their procession
the antients would certainly have invoked the goddess flora for this purpose and it would have been no difficulty for their priests or politicians to have persuaded the people of the real presence of the deity though a plain mortal had personated her and performed her office
but we have no such design of imposing on our reader and therefore those who object to the heathen theology may if they please change our goddess into the abovementioned basketwoman
our intention in short is to introduce our heroine with the utmost solemnity in our power with an elevation of stile and all other circumstances proper to raise the veneration of our readerindeed we would for certain causes advise those of our male readers who have any hearts to read no farther were we not well assured that how amiable soever the picture of our heroine will appear as it is really a copy from nature many of our fair countrywomen will be found worthy to satisfy any passion and to answer any idea of female perfection which our pencil will be able to raise
and now without any further preface we proceed to our next chapter
chapter ii
a short hint of what we can do in the sublime and a description of miss sophia western
hushed be every ruder breath
may the heathen ruler of the winds confine in iron chains the boisterous limbs of noisy boreas and the sharppointed nose of bitterbiting eurus
do thou sweet zephyrus rising from thy fragrant bed mount the western sky and lead on those delicious gales the charms of which call forth the lovely flora from her chamber perfumed with pearly dews when on the st of june her birthday the blooming maid in loose attire gently trips it over the verdant mead where every flower rises to do her homage till the whole field becomes enamelled and colours contend with sweets which shall ravish her most
so charming may she now appear
and you the feathered choristers of nature whose sweetest notes not even handel can excell tune your melodious throats to celebrate her appearance
from love proceeds your music and to love it returns
awaken therefore that gentle passion in every swain for lo
adorned with all the charms in which nature can array her bedecked with beauty youth sprightliness innocence modesty and tenderness breathing sweetness from her rosy lips and darting brightness from her sparkling eyes the lovely sophia comes
reader perhaps thou hast seen the statue of the venus de medicis
perhaps too thou hast seen the gallery of beauties at hampton court
thou may'st remember each bright churchill of the galaxy and all the toasts of the kitcat
or if their reign was before thy times at least thou hast seen their daughters the no less dazzling beauties of the present age whose names should we here insert we apprehend they would fill the whole volume
now if thou hast seen all these be not afraid of the rude answer which lord rochester once gave to a man who had seen many things
no
if thou hast seen all these without knowing what beauty is thou hast no eyes if without feeling its power thou hast no heart
yet is it possible my friend that thou mayest have seen all these without being able to form an exact idea of sophia for she did not exactly resemble any of them
she was most like the picture of lady ranelagh and i have heard more still to the famous dutchess of mazarine but most of all she resembled one whose image never can depart from my breast and whom if thou dost remember thou hast then my friend an adequate idea of sophia
but lest this should not have been thy fortune we will endeavour with our utmost skill to describe this paragon though we are sensible that our highest abilities are very inadequate to the task
sophia then the only daughter of mr western was a middlesized woman but rather inclining to tall
her shape was not only exact but extremely delicate and the nice proportion of her arms promised the truest symmetry in her limbs
her hair which was black was so luxuriant that it reached her middle before she cut it to comply with the modern fashion and it was now curled so gracefully in her neck that few could believe it to be her own
if envy could find any part of the face which demanded less commendation than the rest it might possibly think her forehead might have been higher without prejudice to her
her eyebrows were full even and arched beyond the power of art to imitate
her black eyes had a lustre in them which all her softness could not extinguish
her nose was exactly regular and her mouth in which were two rows of ivory exactly answered sir john suckling's description in those lines        her lips were red and one was thin       compar'd to that was next her chin
some bee had stung it newly
her cheeks were of the oval kind and in her right she had a dimple which the least smile discovered
her chin had certainly its share in forming the beauty of her face but it was difficult to say it was either large or small though perhaps it was rather of the former kind
her complexion had rather more of the lily than of the rose but when exercise or modesty increased her natural colour no vermilion could equal it
then one might indeed cry out with the celebrated dr donne       her pure and eloquent blood      spoke in her cheeks and so distinctly wrought      that one might almost say her body thought
her neck was long and finely turned and here if i was not afraid of offending her delicacy i might justly say the highest beauties of the famous venus de medicis were outdone
here was whiteness which no lilies ivory nor alabaster could match
the finest cambric might indeed be supposed from envy to cover that bosom which was much whiter than itselfit was indeed       nitor splendens pario marmore purius
a gloss shining beyond the purest brightness of parian marble
such was the outside of sophia nor was this beautiful frame disgraced by an inhabitant unworthy of it
her mind was every way equal to her person nay the latter borrowed some charms from the former for when she smiled the sweetness of her temper diffused that glory over her countenance which no regularity of features can give
but as there are no perfections of the mind which do not discover themselves in that perfect intimacy to which we intend to introduce our reader with this charming young creature so it is needless to mention them here nay it is a kind of tacit affront to our reader's understanding and may also rob him of that pleasure which he will receive in forming his own judgment of her character
it may however be proper to say that whatever mental accomplishments she had derived from nature they were somewhat improved and cultivated by art for she had been educated under the care of an aunt who was a lady of great discretion and was thoroughly acquainted with the world having lived in her youth about the court whence she had retired some years since into the country
by her conversation and instructions sophia was perfectly well bred though perhaps she wanted a little of that ease in her behaviour which is to be acquired only by habit and living within what is called the polite circle
but this to say the truth is often too dearly purchased and though it hath charms so inexpressible that the french perhaps among other qualities mean to express this when they declare they know not what it is yet its absence is well compensated by innocence nor can good sense and a natural gentility ever stand in need of it
chapter iii
wherein the history goes back to commemorate a trifling incident that happened some years since but which trifling as it was had some future consequences
the amiable sophia was now in her eighteenth year when she is introduced into this history
her father as hath been said was fonder of her than of any other human creature
to her therefore tom jones applied in order to engage her interest on the behalf of his friend the gamekeeper
but before we proceed to this business a short recapitulation of some previous matters may be necessary
though the different tempers of mr allworthy and of mr western did not admit of a very intimate correspondence yet they lived upon what is called a decent footing together by which means the young people of both families had been acquainted from their infancy and as they were all near of the same age had been frequent playmates together
the gaiety of tom's temper suited better with sophia than the grave and sober disposition of master blifil
and the preference which she gave the former of these would often appear so plainly that a lad of a more passionate turn than master blifil was might have shown some displeasure at it
as he did not however outwardly express any such disgust it would be an ill office in us to pay a visit to the inmost recesses of his mind as some scandalous people search into the most secret affairs of their friends and often pry into their closets and cupboards only to discover their poverty and meanness to the world
however as persons who suspect they have given others cause of offence are apt to conclude they are offended so sophia imputed an action of master blifil to his anger which the superior sagacity of thwackum and square discerned to have arisen from a much better principle
tom jones when very young had presented sophia with a little bird which he had taken from the nest had nursed up and taught to sing
of this bird sophia then about thirteen years old was so extremely fond that her chief business was to feed and tend it and her chief pleasure to play with it
by these means little tommy for so the bird was called was become so tame that it would feed out of the hand of its mistress would perch upon the finger and lie contented in her bosom where it seemed almost sensible of its own happiness though she always kept a small string about its leg nor would ever trust it with the liberty of flying away
one day when mr allworthy and his whole family dined at mr western's master blifil being in the garden with little sophia and observing the extreme fondness that she showed for her little bird desired her to trust it for a moment in his hands
sophia presently complied with the young gentleman's request and after some previous caution delivered him her bird of which he was no sooner in possession than he slipt the string from its leg and tossed it into the air
the foolish animal no sooner perceived itself at liberty than forgetting all the favours it had received from sophia it flew directly from her and perched on a bough at some distance
sophia seeing her bird gone screamed out so loud that tom jones who was at a little distance immediately ran to her assistance
he was no sooner informed of what had happened than he cursed blifil for a pitiful malicious rascal and then immediately stripping off his coat he applied himself to climbing the tree to which the bird escaped
tom had almost recovered his little namesake when the branch on which it was perched and that hung over a canal broke and the poor lad plumped over head and ears into the water
sophia's concern now changed its object
and as she apprehended the boy's life was in danger she screamed ten times louder than before and indeed master blifil himself now seconded her with all the vociferation in his power
the company who were sitting in a room next the garden were instantly alarmed and came all forth but just as they reached the canal tom for the water was luckily pretty shallow in that part arrived safely on shore
thwackum fell violently on poor tom who stood dropping and shivering before him when mr allworthy desired him to have patience and turning to master blifil said pray child what is the reason of all this disturbance  master blifil answered indeed uncle i am very sorry for what i have done i have been unhappily the occasion of it all
i had miss sophia's bird in my hand and thinking the poor creature languished for liberty i own i could not forbear giving it what it desired for i always thought there was something very cruel in confining anything
it seemed to be against the law of nature by which everything hath a right to liberty nay it is even unchristian for it is not doing what we would be done by but if i had imagined miss sophia would have been so much concerned at it i am sure i never would have done it nay if i had known what would have happened to the bird itself for when master jones who climbed up that tree after it fell into the water the bird took a second flight and presently a nasty hawk carried it away  poor sophia who now first heard of her little tommy's fate for her concern for jones had prevented her perceiving it when it happened shed a shower of tears
these mr allworthy endeavoured to assuage promising her a much finer bird but she declared she would never have another
her father chid her for crying so for a foolish bird but could not help telling young blifil if he was a son of his his backside should be well flead
sophia now returned to her chamber the two young gentlemen were sent home and the rest of the company returned to their bottle where a conversation ensued on the subject of the bird so curious that we think it deserves a chapter by itself
chapter iv
containing such very deep and grave matters that some readers perhaps may not relish it
square had no sooner lighted his pipe than addressing himself to allworthy he thus began sir i cannot help congratulating you on your nephew who at an age when few lads have any ideas but of sensible objects is arrived at a capacity of distinguishing right from wrong
to confine anything seems to me against the law of nature by which everything hath a right to liberty
these were his words and the impression they have made on me is never to be eradicated
can any man have a higher notion of the rule of right and the eternal fitness of things
i cannot help promising myself from such a dawn that the meridian of this youth will be equal to that of either the elder or the younger brutus  here thwackum hastily interrupted and spilling some of his wine and swallowing the rest with great eagerness answered from another expression he made use of i hope he will resemble much better men
the law of nature is a jargon of words which means nothing
i know not of any such law nor of any right which can be derived from it
to do as we would be done by is indeed a christian motive as the boy well expressed himself and i am glad to find my instructions have borne such good fruit  if vanity was a thing fit says square i might indulge some on the same occasion for whence only he can have learnt his notions of right or wrong i think is pretty apparent
if there be no law of nature there is no right nor wrong  how says the parson do you then banish revelation
am i talking with a deist or an atheist  drink about says western
pox of your laws of nature
i don't know what you mean either of you by right and wrong
to take away my girl's bird was wrong in my opinion and my neighbour allworthy may do as he pleases but to encourage boys in such practices is to breed them up to the gallows  allworthy answered that he was sorry for what his nephew had done but could not consent to punish him as he acted rather from a generous than unworthy motive he said if the boy had stolen the bird none would have been more ready to vote for a severe chastisement than himself but it was plain that was not his design  and indeed it was as apparent to him that he could have no other view but what he had himself avowed
for as to that malicious purpose which sophia suspected it never once entered into the head of mr allworthy
he at length concluded with again blaming the action as inconsiderate and which he said was pardonable only in a child
square had delivered his opinion so openly that if he was now silent he must submit to have his judgment censured
he said therefore with some warmth that mr allworthy had too much respect to the dirty consideration of property
that in passing our judgments on great and mighty actions all private regards should be laid aside for by adhering to those narrow rules the younger brutus had been condemned of ingratitude and the elder of parricide  and if they had been hanged too for those crimes cried thwackum they would have had no more than their deserts
a couple of heathenish villains
heaven be praised we have no brutuses nowadays
i wish mr square you would desist from filling the minds of my pupils with such antichristian stuff for the consequence must be while they are under my care its being well scourged out of them again
there is your disciple tom almost spoiled already
i overheard him the other day disputing with master blifil that there was no merit in faith without works
i know that is one of your tenets and i suppose he had it from you  don't accuse me of spoiling him says square
who taught him to laugh at whatever is virtuous and decent and fit and right in the nature of things
he is your own scholar and i disclaim him
no no master blifil is my boy
young as he is that lad's notions of moral rectitude i defy you ever to eradicate  thwackum put on a contemptuous sneer at this and replied ay ay i will venture him with you
he is too well grounded for all your philosophical cant to hurt
no no i have taken care to instil such principles into him  and i have instilled principles into him too cries square
what but the sublime idea of virtue could inspire a human mind with the generous thought of giving liberty
and i repeat to you again if it was a fit thing to be proud i might claim the honour of having infused that idea  and if pride was not forbidden said thwackum i might boast of having taught him that duty which he himself assigned as his motive  so between you both says the squire the young gentleman hath been taught to rob my daughter of her bird
i find i must take care of my partridgemew
i shall have some virtuous religious man or other set all my partridges at liberty then slapping a gentleman of the law who was present on the back he cried out what say you to this mr counsellor
is not this against law  the lawyer with great gravity delivered himself as follows  if the case be put of a partridge there can be no doubt but an action would lie for though this be ferae naturae yet being reclaimed property vests but being the case of a singing bird though reclaimed as it is a thing of base nature it must be considered as nullius in bonis
in this case therefore i conceive the plaintiff must be nonsuited and i should disadvise the bringing any such action  well says the squire if it be nullus bonus let us drink about and talk a little of the state of the nation or some such discourse that we all understand for i am sure i don't understand a word of this
it may be learning and sense for aught i know but you shall never persuade me into it
pox
you have neither of you mentioned a word of that poor lad who deserves to be commended to venture breaking his neck to oblige my girl was a generousspirited action i have learning enough to see that
dn me here's tom's health
i shall love the boy for it the longest day i have to live  thus was the debate interrupted but it would probably have been soon resumed had not mr allworthy presently called for his coach and carried off the two combatants
such was the conclusion of this adventure of the bird and of the dialogue occasioned by it which we could not help recounting to our reader though it happened some years before that stage or period of time at which our history is now arrived
chapter v  containing matter accommodated to every taste
parva leves capiunt animossmall things affect light minds was the sentiment of a great master of the passion of love
and certain it is that from this day sophia began to have some little kindness for tom jones and no little aversion for his companion
many accidents from time to time improved both these passions in her breast which without our recounting the reader may well conclude from what we have before hinted of the different tempers of these lads and how much the one suited with her own inclinations more than the other
to say the truth sophia when very young discerned that tom though an idle thoughtless rattling rascal was nobody's enemy but his own and that master blifil though a prudent discreet sober young gentleman was at the same time strongly attached to the interest only of one single person and who that single person was the reader will be able to divine without any assistance of ours
these two characters are not always received in the world with the different regard which seems severally due to either and which one would imagine mankind from selfinterest should show towards them
but perhaps there may be a political reason for it in finding one of a truly benevolent disposition men may very reasonably suppose they have found a treasure and be desirous of keeping it like all other good things to themselves
hence they may imagine that to trumpet forth the praises of such a person would in the vulgar phrase be crying roastmeat and calling in partakers of what they intend to apply solely to their own use
if this reason does not satisfy the reader i know no other means of accounting for the little respect which i have commonly seen paid to a character which really does great honour to human nature and is productive of the highest good to society
but it was otherwise with sophia
she honoured tom jones and scorned master blifil almost as soon as she knew the meaning of those two words
sophia had been absent upwards of three years with her aunt during all which time she had seldom seen either of these young gentlemen
she dined however once together with her aunt at mr allworthy's
this was a few days after the adventure of the partridge before commemorated
sophia heard the whole story at table where she said nothing nor indeed could her aunt get many words from her as she returned home but her maid when undressing her happening to say well miss i suppose you have seen young master blifil today she answered with much passion i hate the name of master blifil as i do whatever is base and treacherous and i wonder mr allworthy would suffer that old barbarous schoolmaster to punish a poor boy so cruelly for what was only the effect of his goodnature she then recounted the story to her maid and concluded with saying don't you think he is a boy of noble spirit  this young lady was now returned to her father who gave her the command of his house and placed her at the upper end of his table where tom who for his great love of hunting was become a great favourite of the squire often dined
young men of open generous dispositions are naturally inclined to gallantry which if they have good understandings as was in reality tom's case exerts itself in an obliging complacent behaviour to all women in general
this greatly distinguished tom from the boisterous brutality of mere country squires on the one hand and from the solemn and somewhat sullen deportment of master blifil on the other and he began now at twenty to have the name of a pretty fellow among all the women in the neighbourhood
tom behaved to sophia with no particularity unless perhaps by showing her a higher respect than he paid to any other
this distinction her beauty fortune sense and amiable carriage seemed to demand but as to design upon her person he had none for which we shall at present suffer the reader to condemn him of stupidity but perhaps we shall be able indifferently well to account for it hereafter
sophia with the highest degree of innocence and modesty had a remarkable sprightliness in her temper
this was so greatly increased whenever she was in company with tom that had he not been very young and thoughtless he must have observed it or had not mr western's thoughts been generally either in the field the stable or the dogkennel it might have perhaps created some jealousy in him but so far was the good gentleman from entertaining any such suspicions that he gave tom every opportunity with his daughter which any lover could have wished and this tom innocently improved to better advantage by following only the dictates of his natural gallantry and goodnature than he might perhaps have done had he had the deepest designs on the young lady
but indeed it can occasion little wonder that this matter escaped the observation of others since poor sophia herself never remarked it and her heart was irretrievably lost before she suspected it was in danger
matters were in this situation when tom one afternoon finding sophia alone began after a short apology with a very serious face to acquaint her that he had a favour to ask of her which he hoped her goodness would comply with
though neither the young man's behaviour nor indeed his manner of opening this business were such as could give her any just cause of suspecting he intended to make love to her yet whether nature whispered something into her ear or from what cause it arose i will not determine certain it is some idea of that kind must have intruded itself for her colour forsook her cheeks her limbs trembled and her tongue would have faltered had tom stopped for an answer but he soon relieved her from her perplexity by proceeding to inform her of his request which was to solicit her interest on behalf of the gamekeeper whose own ruin and that of a large family must be he said the consequence of mr western's pursuing his action against him
sophia presently recovered her confusion and with a smile full of sweetness said is this the mighty favour you asked with so much gravity
i will do it with all my heart
i really pity the poor fellow and no longer ago than yesterday sent a small matter to his wife this small matter was one of her gowns some linen and ten shillings in money of which tom had heard and it had in reality put this solicitation into his head
our youth now emboldened with his success resolved to push the matter farther and ventured even to beg her recommendation of him to her father's service protesting that he thought him one of the honestest fellows in the country and extremely well qualified for the place of a gamekeeper which luckily then happened to be vacant
sophia answered well i will undertake this too but i cannot promise you as much success as in the former part which i assure you i will not quit my father without obtaining
however i will do what i can for the poor fellow for i sincerely look upon him and his family as objects of great compassion
and now mr jones i must ask you a favour  a favour madam cries tom if you knew the pleasure you have given me in the hopes of receiving a command from you you would think by mentioning it you did confer the greatest favour on me for by this dear hand i would sacrifice my life to oblige you  he then snatched her hand and eagerly kissed it which was the first time his lips had ever touched her
the blood which before had forsaken her cheeks now made her sufficient amends by rushing all over her face and neck with such violence that they became all of a scarlet colour
she now first felt a sensation to which she had been before a stranger and which when she had leisure to reflect on it began to acquaint her with some secrets which the reader if he doth not already guess them will know in due time
sophia as soon as she could speak which was not instantly informed him that the favour she had to desire of him was not to lead her father through so many dangers in hunting for that from what she had heard she was terribly frightened every time they went out together and expected some day or other to see her father brought home with broken limbs
she therefore begged him for her sake to be more cautious and as he well knew mr western would follow him not to ride so madly nor to take those dangerous leaps for the future
tom promised faithfully to obey her commands and after thanking her for her kind compliance with his request took his leave and departed highly charmed with his success
poor sophia was charmed too but in a very different way
her sensations however the reader's heart if he or she have any will better represent than i can if i had as many mouths as ever poet wished for to eat i suppose those many dainties with which he was so plentifully provided
it was mr western's custom every afternoon as soon as he was drunk to hear his daughter play on the harpsichord for he was a great lover of music and perhaps had he lived in town might have passed for a connoisseur for he always excepted against the finest compositions of mr handel
he never relished any music but what was light and airy and indeed his most favourite tunes were old sir simon the king st george he was for england bobbing joan and some others
his daughter though she was a perfect mistress of music and would never willingly have played any but handel's was so devoted to her father's pleasure that she learnt all those tunes to oblige him
however she would now and then endeavour to lead him into her own taste and when he required the repetition of his ballads would answer with a nay dear sir and would often beg him to suffer her to play something else
this evening however when the gentleman was retired from his bottle she played all his favourites three times over without any solicitation
this so pleased the good squire that he started from his couch gave his daughter a kiss and swore her hand was greatly improved
she took this opportunity to execute her promise to tom in which she succeeded so well that the squire declared if she would give him t'other bout of old sir simon he would give the gamekeeper his deputation the next morning
sir simon was played again and again till the charms of the music soothed mr western to sleep
in the morning sophia did not fail to remind him of his engagement and his attorney was immediately sent for ordered to stop any further proceedings in the action and to make out the deputation
tom's success in this affair soon began to ring over the country and various were the censures passed upon it some greatly applauding it as an act of good nature others sneering and saying no wonder that one idle fellow should love another young blifil was greatly enraged at it
he had long hated black george in the same proportion as jones delighted in him not from any offence which he had ever received but from his great love to religion and virtuefor black george had the reputation of a loose kind of a fellow
blifil therefore represented this as flying in mr allworthy's face and declared with great concern that it was impossible to find any other motive for doing good to such a wretch
thwackum and square likewise sung to the same tune
they were now especially the latter become greatly jealous of young jones with the widow for he now approached the age of twenty was really a fine young fellow and that lady by her encouragements to him seemed daily more and more to think him so
allworthy was not however moved with their malice
he declared himself very well satisfied with what jones had done
he said the perseverance and integrity of his friendship was highly commendable and he wished he could see more frequent instances of that virtue
but fortune who seldom greatly relishes such sparks as my friend tom perhaps because they do not pay more ardent addresses to her gave now a very different turn to all his actions and showed them to mr allworthy in a light far less agreeable than that gentleman's goodness had hitherto seen them in
chapter vi
an apology for the insensibility of mr jones to all the charms of the lovely sophia in which possibly we may in a considerable degree lower his character in the estimation of those men of wit and gallantry who approve the heroes in most of our modern comedies
there are two sorts of people who i am afraid have already conceived some contempt for my heroe on account of his behaviour to sophia
the former of these will blame his prudence in neglecting an opportunity to possess himself of mr western's fortune and the latter will no less despise him for his backwardness to so fine a girl who seemed ready to fly into his arms if he would open them to receive her
now though i shall not perhaps be able absolutely to acquit him of either of these charges for want of prudence admits of no excuse and what i shall produce against the latter charge will i apprehend be scarce satisfactory yet as evidence may sometimes be offered in mitigation i shall set forth the plain matter of fact and leave the whole to the reader's determination
mr jones had somewhat about him which though i think writers are not thoroughly agreed in its name doth certainly inhabit some human breasts whose use is not so properly to distinguish right from wrong as to prompt and incite them to the former and to restrain and withhold them from the latter
this somewhat may be indeed resembled to the famous trunkmaker in the playhouse for whenever the person who is possessed of it doth what is right no ravished or friendly spectator is so eager or so loud in his applause on the contrary when he doth wrong no critic is so apt to hiss and explode him
to give a higher idea of the principle i mean as well as one more familiar to the present age it may be considered as sitting on its throne in the mind like the lord high chancellor of this kingdom in his court where it presides governs directs judges acquits and condemns according to merit and justice with a knowledge which nothing escapes a penetration which nothing can deceive and an integrity which nothing can corrupt
this active principle may perhaps be said to constitute the most essential barrier between us and our neighbours the brutes for if there be some in the human shape who are not under any such dominion i choose rather to consider them as deserters from us to our neighbours among whom they will have the fate of deserters and not be placed in the first rank
our heroe whether he derived it from thwackum or square i will not determine was very strongly under the guidance of this principle for though he did not always act rightly yet he never did otherwise without feeling and suffering for it
it was this which taught him that to repay the civilities and little friendships of hospitality by robbing the house where you have received them is to be the basest and meanest of thieves
he did not think the baseness of this offence lessened by the height of the injury committed on the contrary if to steal another's plate deserved death and infamy it seemed to him difficult to assign a punishment adequate to the robbing a man of his whole fortune and of his child into the bargain
this principle therefore prevented him from any thought of making his fortune by such means for this as i have said is an active principle and doth not content itself with knowledge or belief only
had he been greatly enamoured of sophia he possibly might have thought otherwise but give me leave to say there is great difference between running away with a man's daughter from the motive of love and doing the same thing from the motive of theft
now though this young gentleman was not insensible of the charms of sophia though he greatly liked her beauty and esteemed all her other qualifications she had made however no deep impression on his heart for which as it renders him liable to the charge of stupidity or at least of want of taste we shall now proceed to account
the truth then is his heart was in the possession of another woman
here i question not but the reader will be surprized at our long taciturnity as to this matter and quite at a loss to divine who this woman was since we have hitherto not dropt a hint of any one likely to be a rival to sophia for as to mrs blifil though we have been obliged to mention some suspicions of her affection for tom we have not hitherto given the least latitude for imagining that he had any for her and indeed i am sorry to say it but the youth of both sexes are too apt to be deficient in their gratitude for that regard with which persons more advanced in years are sometimes so kind to honour them
that the reader may be no longer in suspense he will be pleased to remember that we have often mentioned the family of george seagrim commonly called black george the gamekeeper which consisted at present of a wife and five children
the second of these children was a daughter whose name was molly and who was esteemed one of the handsomest girls in the whole country
congreve well says there is in true beauty something which vulgar souls cannot admire so can no dirt or rags hide this something from those souls which are not of the vulgar stamp
the beauty of this girl made however no impression on tom till she grew towards the age of sixteen when tom who was near three years older began first to cast the eyes of affection upon her
and this affection he had fixed on the girl long before he could bring himself to attempt the possession of her person for though his constitution urged him greatly to this his principles no less forcibly restrained him
to debauch a young woman however low her condition was appeared to him a very heinous crime and the goodwill he bore the father with the compassion he had for his family very strongly corroborated all such sober reflections so that he once resolved to get the better of his inclinations and he actually abstained three whole months without ever going to seagrim's house or seeing his daughter
now though molly was as we have said generally thought a very fine girl and in reality she was so yet her beauty was not of the most amiable kind
it had indeed very little of feminine in it and would have become a man at least as well as a woman for to say the truth youth and florid health had a very considerable share in the composition
nor was her mind more effeminate than her person
as this was tall and robust so was that bold and forward
so little had she of modesty that jones had more regard for her virtue than she herself
and as most probably she liked tom as well as he liked her so when she perceived his backwardness she herself grew proportionably forward and when she saw he had entirely deserted the house she found means of throwing herself in his way and behaved in such a manner that the youth must have had very much or very little of the heroe if her endeavours had proved unsuccessful
in a word she soon triumphed over all the virtuous resolutions of jones for though she behaved at last with all decent reluctance yet i rather chuse to attribute the triumph to her since in fact it was her design which succeeded
in the conduct of this matter i say molly so well played her part that jones attributed the conquest entirely to himself and considered the young woman as one who had yielded to the violent attacks of his passion
he likewise imputed her yielding to the ungovernable force of her love towards him and this the reader will allow to have been a very natural and probable supposition as we have more than once mentioned the uncommon comeliness of his person and indeed he was one of the handsomest young fellows in the world
as there are some minds whose affections like master blifil's are solely placed on one single person whose interest and indulgence alone they consider on every occasion regarding the good and ill of all others as merely indifferent any farther than as they contribute to the pleasure or advantage of that person so there is a different temper of mind which borrows a degree of virtue even from selflove
such can never receive any kind of satisfaction from another without loving the creature to whom that satisfaction is owing and without making its wellbeing in some sort necessary to their own ease
of this latter species was our heroe
he considered this poor girl as one whose happiness or misery he had caused to be dependent on himself
her beauty was still the object of desire though greater beauty or a fresher object might have been more so but the little abatement which fruition had occasioned to this was highly overbalanced by the considerations of the affection which she visibly bore him and of the situation into which he had brought her
the former of these created gratitude the latter compassion and both together with his desire for her person raised in him a passion which might without any great violence to the word be called love though perhaps it was at first not very judiciously placed
this then was the true reason of that insensibility which he had shown to the charms of sophia and that behaviour in her which might have been reasonably enough interpreted as an encouragement to his addresses for as he could not think of abandoning his molly poor and destitute as she was so no more could he entertain a notion of betraying such a creature as sophia
and surely had he given the least encouragement to any passion for that young lady he must have been absolutely guilty of one or other of those crimes either of which would in my opinion have very justly subjected him to that fate which at his first introduction into this history i mentioned to have been generally predicted as his certain destiny
chapter vii
being the shortest chapter in this book
her mother first perceived the alteration in the shape of molly and in order to hide it from her neighbours she foolishly clothed her in that sack which sophia had sent her though indeed that young lady had little apprehension that the poor woman would have been weak enough to let any of her daughters wear it in that form
molly was charmed with the first opportunity she ever had of showing her beauty to advantage for though she could very well bear to contemplate herself in the glass even when dressed in rags and though she had in that dress conquered the heart of jones and perhaps of some others yet she thought the addition of finery would much improve her charms and extend her conquests
molly therefore having dressed herself out in this sack with a new laced cap and some other ornaments which tom had given her repairs to church with her fan in her hand the very next sunday
the great are deceived if they imagine they have appropriated ambition and vanity to themselves
these noble qualities flourish as notably in a country church and churchyard as in the drawingroom or in the closet
schemes have indeed been laid in the vestry which would hardly disgrace the conclave
here is a ministry and here is an opposition
here are plots and circumventions parties and factions equal to those which are to be found in courts
nor are the women here less practised in the highest feminine arts than their fair superiors in quality and fortune
here are prudes and coquettes
here are dressing and ogling falsehood envy malice scandal in short everything which is common to the most splendid assembly or politest circle
let those of high life therefore no longer despise the ignorance of their inferiors nor the vulgar any longer rail at the vices of their betters
molly had seated herself some time before she was known by her neighbours
and then a whisper ran through the whole congregation who is she but when she was discovered such sneering gigling tittering and laughing ensued among the women that mr allworthy was obliged to exert his authority to preserve any decency among them
chapter viii
a battle sung by the muse in the homerican style and which none but the classical reader can taste
mr western had an estate in this parish and as his house stood at little greater distance from this church than from his own he very often came to divine service here and both he and the charming sophia happened to be present at this time
sophia was much pleased with the beauty of the girl whom she pitied for her simplicity in having dressed herself in that manner as she saw the envy which it had occasioned among her equals
she no sooner came home than she sent for the gamekeeper and ordered him to bring his daughter to her saying she would provide for her in the family and might possibly place the girl about her own person when her own maid who was now going away had left her
poor seagrim was thunderstruck at this for he was no stranger to the fault in the shape of his daughter
he answered in a stammering voice that he was afraid molly would be too awkward to wait on her ladyship as she had never been at service no matter for that  says sophia she will soon improve
i am pleased with the girl and am resolved to try her  black george now repaired to his wife on whose prudent counsel he depended to extricate him out of this dilemma but when he came thither he found his house in some confusion
so great envy had this sack occasioned that when mr allworthy and the other gentry were gone from church the rage which had hitherto been confined burst into an uproar and having vented itself at first in opprobrious words laughs hisses and gestures betook itself at last to certain missile weapons which though from their plastic nature they threatened neither the loss of life or of limb were however sufficiently dreadful to a welldressed lady
molly had too much spirit to bear this treatment tamely
having thereforebut hold as we are diffident of our own abilities let us here invite a superior power to our assistance
ye muses then whoever ye are who love to sing battles and principally thou who whilom didst recount the slaughter in those fields where hudibras and trulla fought if thou wert not starved with thy friend butler assist me on this great occasion
all things are not in the power of all
as a vast herd of cows in a rich farmer's yard if while they are milked they hear their calves at a distance lamenting the robbery which is then committing roar and bellow so roared forth the somersetshire mob an hallaloo made up of almost as many squalls screams and other different sounds as there were persons or indeed passions among them some were inspired by rage others alarmed by fear and others had nothing in their heads but the love of fun but chiefly envy the sister of satan and his constant companion rushed among the crowd and blew up the fury of the women who no sooner came up to molly than they pelted her with dirt and rubbish
molly having endeavoured in vain to make a handsome retreat faced about and laying hold of ragged bess who advanced in the front of the enemy she at one blow felled her to the ground
the whole army of the enemy though near a hundred in number seeing the fate of their general gave back many paces and retired behind a newdug grave for the churchyard was the field of battle where there was to be a funeral that very evening
molly pursued her victory and catching up a skull which lay on the side of the grave discharged it with such fury that having hit a taylor on the head the two skulls sent equally forth a hollow sound at their meeting and the taylor took presently measure of his length on the ground where the skulls lay side by side and it was doubtful which was the more valuable of the two
molly then taking a thighbone in her hand fell in among the flying ranks and dealing her blows with great liberality on either side overthrew the carcass of many a mighty heroe and heroine
recount o muse the names of those who fell on this fatal day
first jemmy tweedle felt on his hinder head the direful bone
him the pleasant banks of sweetlywinding stour had nourished where he first learnt the vocal art with which wandering up and down at wakes and fairs he cheered the rural nymphs and swains when upon the green they interweaved the sprightly dance while he himself stood fiddling and jumping to his own music
how little now avails his fiddle
he thumps the verdant floor with his carcass
next old echepole the sowgelder received a blow in his forehead from our amazonian heroine and immediately fell to the ground
he was a swinging fat fellow and fell with almost as much noise as a house
his tobaccobox dropped at the same time from his pocket which molly took up as lawful spoils
then kate of the mill tumbled unfortunately over a tombstone which catching hold of her ungartered stocking inverted the order of nature and gave her heels the superiority to her head
betty pippin with young roger her lover fell both to the ground where oh perverse fate
she salutes the earth and he the sky
tom freckle the smith's son was the next victim to her rage
he was an ingenious workman and made excellent pattens nay the very patten with which he was knocked down was his own workmanship
had he been at that time singing psalms in the church he would have avoided a broken head
miss crow the daughter of a farmer john giddish himself a farmer nan slouch esther codling will spray tom bennet the three misses potter whose father keeps the sign of the red lion betty chambermaid jack ostler and many others of inferior note lay rolling among the graves
not that the strenuous arm of molly reached all these for many of them in their flight overthrew each other
but now fortune fearing she had acted out of character and had inclined too long to the same side especially as it was the right side hastily turned about for now goody brownwhom zekiel brown caressed in his arms nor he alone but half the parish besides so famous was she in the fields of venus nor indeed less in those of mars
the trophies of both these her husband always bore about on his head and face for if ever human head did by its horns display the amorous glories of a wife zekiel's did nor did his wellscratched face less denote her talents or rather talons of a different kind
no longer bore this amazon the shameful flight of her party
she stopt short and calling aloud to all who fled spoke as follows ye somersetshire men or rather ye somersetshire women are ye not ashamed thus to fly from a single woman
but if no other will oppose her i myself and joan top here will have the honour of the victory  having thus said she flew at molly seagrim and easily wrenched the thighbone from her hand at the same time clawing off her cap from her head
then laying hold of the hair of molly with her left hand she attacked her so furiously in the face with the right that the blood soon began to trickle from her nose
molly was not idle this while
she soon removed the clout from the head of goody brown and then fastening on her hair with one hand with the other she caused another bloody stream to issue forth from the nostrils of the enemy
when each of the combatants had borne off sufficient spoils of hair from the head of her antagonist the next rage was against the garments
in this attack they exerted so much violence that in a very few minutes they were both naked to the middle
it is lucky for the women that the seat of fistycuff war is not the same with them as among men but though they may seem a little to deviate from their sex when they go forth to battle yet i have observed they never so far forget as to assail the bosoms of each other where a few blows would be fatal to most of them
this i know some derive from their being of a more bloody inclination than the males
on which account they apply to the nose as to the part whence blood may most easily be drawn but this seems a farfetched as well as illnatured supposition
goody brown had great advantage of molly in this particular for the former had indeed no breasts her bosom if it may be so called as well in colour as in many other properties exactly resembling an antient piece of parchment upon which any one might have drummed a considerable while without doing her any great damage
molly beside her present unhappy condition was differently formed in those parts and might perhaps have tempted the envy of brown to give her a fatal blow had not the lucky arrival of tom jones at this instant put an immediate end to the bloody scene
this accident was luckily owing to mr square for he master blifil and jones had mounted their horses after church to take the air and had ridden about a quarter of a mile when square changing his mind not idly but for a reason which we shall unfold as soon as we have leisure desired the young gentlemen to ride with him another way than they had at first purposed
this motion being complied with brought them of necessity back again to the churchyard
master blifil who rode first seeing such a mob assembled and two women in the posture in which we left the combatants stopt his horse to enquire what was the matter
a country fellow scratching his head answered him i don't know measter un't i an't please your honour here hath been a vight i think between goody brown and moll seagrim  who who cries tom but without waiting for an answer having discovered the features of his molly through all the discomposure in which they now were he hastily alighted turned his horse loose and leaping over the wall ran to her
she now first bursting into tears told him how barbarously she had been treated
upon which forgetting the sex of goody brown or perhaps not knowing it in his ragefor in reality she had no feminine appearance but a petticoat which he might not observehe gave her a lash or two with his horsewhip and then flying at the mob who were all accused by moll he dealt his blows so profusely on all sides that unless i would again invoke the muse which the goodnatured reader may think a little too hard upon her as she hath so lately been violently sweated it would be impossible for me to recount the horsewhipping of that day
having scoured the whole coast of the enemy as well as any of homer's heroes ever did or as don quixote or any knighterrant in the world could have done he returned to molly whom he found in a condition which must give both me and my reader pain was it to be described here
tom raved like a madman beat his breast tore his hair stamped on the ground and vowed the utmost vengeance on all who had been concerned
he then pulled off his coat and buttoned it round her put his hat upon her head wiped the blood from her face as well as he could with his handkerchief and called out to the servant to ride as fast as possible for a sidesaddle or a pillion that he might carry her safe home
master blifil objected to the sending away the servant as they had only one with them but as square seconded the order of jones he was obliged to comply
the servant returned in a very short time with the pillion and molly having collected her rags as well as she could was placed behind him
in which manner she was carried home square blifil and jones attending
here jones having received his coat given her a sly kiss and whispered her that he would return in the evening quitted his molly and rode on after his companions
chapter ix
containing matter of no very peaceable colour
molly had no sooner apparelled herself in her accustomed rags than her sisters began to fall violently upon her particularly her eldest sister who told her she was well enough served
how had she the assurance to wear a gown which young madam western had given to mother
if one of us was to wear it i think says she i myself have the best right but i warrant you think it belongs to your beauty
i suppose you think yourself more handsomer than any of ushand her down the bit of glass from over the cupboard cries another i'd wash the blood from my face before i talked of my beautyyou'd better have minded what the parson says cries the eldest and not a harkened after men vokeindeed child and so she had says the mother sobbing she hath brought a disgrace upon us all
she's the vurst of the vamily that ever was a whore  you need not upbraid me with that mother cries molly you yourself was broughttobed of sister there within a week after you was married  yes hussy answered the enraged mother so i was and what was the mighty matter of that
i was made an honest woman then and if you was to be made an honest woman i should not be angry but you must have to doing with a gentleman you nasty slut you will have a bastard hussy you will and that i defy any one to say of me  in this situation black george found his family when he came home for the purpose before mentioned
as his wife and three daughters were all of them talking together and most of them crying it was some time before he could get an opportunity of being heard but as soon as such an interval occurred he acquainted the company with what sophia had said to him
goody seagrim then began to revile her daughter afresh
here says she you have brought us into a fine quandary indeed
what will madam say to that big belly
oh that ever i should live to see this day  molly answered with great spirit and what is this mighty place which you have got for me father for he had not well understood the phrase used by sophia of being about her person
i suppose it is to be under the cook but i shan't wash dishes for anybody
my gentleman will provide better for me
see what he hath given me this afternoon
he hath promised i shall never want money and you shan't want money neither mother if you will hold your tongue and know when you are well and so saying she pulled out several guineas and gave her mother one of them
the good woman no sooner felt the gold within her palm than her temper began such is the efficacy of that panacea to be mollified
why husband says she would any but such a blockhead as you not have enquired what place this was before he had accepted it
perhaps as molly says it may be in the kitchen and truly i don't care my daughter should be a scullion wench for poor as i am i am a gentlewoman
and thof i was obliged as my father who was a clergyman died worse than nothing and so could not give me a shilling of potion to undervalue myself by marrying a poor man yet i would have you to know i have a spirit above all them things
marry come up
it would better become madam western to look at home and remember who her own grandfather was
some of my family for aught i know might ride in their coaches when the grandfathers of some voke walked avoot
i warrant she fancies she did a mighty matter when she sent us that old gownd some of my family would not have picked up such rags in the street but poor people are always trampled uponthe parish need not have been in such a fluster with molly
you might have told them child your grandmother wore better things new out of the shop  well but consider cried george what answer shall i make to madam  i don't know what answer says she you are always bringing your family into one quandary or other
do you remember when you shot the partridge the occasion of all our misfortunes
did not i advise you never to go into squire western's manor
did not i tell you many a good year ago what would come of it
but you would have your own headstrong ways yes you would you villain  black george was in the main a peaceable kind of fellow and nothing choleric nor rash yet did he bear about him something of what the antients called the irascible and which his wife if she had been endowed with much wisdom would have feared
he had long experienced that when the storm grew very high arguments were but wind which served rather to increase than to abate it
he was therefore seldom unprovided with a small switch a remedy of wonderful force as he had often essayed and which the word villain served as a hint for his applying
no sooner therefore had this symptom appeared than he had immediate recourse to the said remedy which though as it is usual in all very efficacious medicines it at first seemed to heighten and inflame the disease soon produced a total calm and restored the patient to perfect ease and tranquillity
this is however a kind of horsemedicine which requires a very robust constitution to digest and is therefore proper only for the vulgar unless in one single instance viz where superiority of birth breaks out in which case we should not think it very improperly applied by any husband whatever if the application was not in itself so base that like certain applications of the physical kind which need not be mentioned it so much degrades and contaminates the hand employed in it that no gentleman should endure the thought of anything so low and detestable
the whole family were soon reduced to a state of perfect quiet for the virtue of this medicine like that of electricity is often communicated through one person to many others who are not touched by the instrument
to say the truth as they both operate by friction it may be doubted whether there is not something analogous between them of which mr freke would do well to enquire before he publishes the next edition of his book
a council was now called in which after many debates molly still persisting that she would not go to service it was at length resolved that goody seagrim herself should wait on miss western and endeavour to procure the place for her eldest daughter who declared great readiness to accept it but fortune who seems to have been an enemy of this little family afterwards put a stop to her promotion
chapter x
a story told by mr supple the curate
the penetration of squire western
his great love for his daughter and the return to it made by her
the next morning tom jones hunted with mr western and was at his return invited by that gentleman to dinner
the lovely sophia shone forth that day with more gaiety and sprightliness than usual
her battery was certainly levelled at our heroe though i believe she herself scarce yet knew her own intention but if she had any design of charming him she now succeeded
mr supple the curate of mr allworthy's parish made one of the company
he was a goodnatured worthy man but chiefly remarkable for his great taciturnity at table though his mouth was never shut at it
in short he had one of the best appetites in the world
however the cloth was no sooner taken away than he always made sufficient amends for his silence for he was a very hearty fellow and his conversation was often entertaining never offensive
at his first arrival which was immediately before the entrance of the roastbeef he had given an intimation that he had brought some news with him and was beginning to tell that he came that moment from mr allworthy's when the sight of the roastbeef struck him dumb permitting him only to say grace and to declare he must pay his respect to the baronet for so he called the sirloin
when dinner was over being reminded by sophia of his news he began as follows i believe lady your ladyship observed a young woman at church yesterday at evensong who was drest in one of your outlandish garments i think i have seen your ladyship in such a one
however in the country such dresses are       rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno  that is madam as much as to say 'a rare bird upon the earth and very like a black swan'
the verse is in juvenal
but to return to what i was relating
i was saying such garments are rare sights in the country and perchance too it was thought the more rare respect being had to the person who wore it who they tell me is the daughter of black george your worship's gamekeeper whose sufferings i should have opined might have taught him more wit than to dress forth his wenches in such gaudy apparel
she created so much confusion in the congregation that if squire allworthy had not silenced it it would have interrupted the service for i was once about to stop in the middle of the first lesson
howbeit nevertheless after prayer was over and i was departed home this occasioned a battle in the churchyard where amongst other mischief the head of a travelling fidler was very much broken
this morning the fidler came to squire allworthy for a warrant and the wench was brought before him
the squire was inclined to have compounded matters when lo
on a sudden the wench appeared i ask your ladyship's pardon to be as it were at the eve of bringing forth a bastard
the squire demanded of her who was the father
but she pertinaciously refused to make any response
so that he was about to make her mittimus to bridewell when i departed  and is a wench having a bastard all your news doctor cries western i thought it might have been some public matter something about the nation  i am afraid it is too common indeed answered the parson but i thought the whole story altogether deserved commemorating
as to national matters your worship knows them best
my concerns extend no farther than my own parish  why ay says the squire i believe i do know a little of that matter as you say
but come tommy drink about the bottle stands with you  tom begged to be excused for that he had particular business and getting up from table escaped the clutches of the squire who was rising to stop him and went off with very little ceremony
the squire gave him a good curse at his departure and then turning to the parson he cried out i smoke it i smoke it
tom is certainly the father of this bastard
zooks parson you remember how he recommended the veather o' her to me
dn un what a sly bch 'tis
ay ay as sure as twopence tom is the veather of the bastard  i should be very sorry for that says the parson
why sorry cries the squire where is the mighty matter o't
what i suppose dost pretend that thee hast never got a bastard
pox
more good luck's thine
for i warrant hast a done a therefore many's the good time and often  your worship is pleased to be jocular answered the parson but i do not only animadvert on the sinfulness of the actionthough that surely is to be greatly deprecatedbut i fear his unrighteousness may injure him with mr allworthy
and truly i must say though he hath the character of being a little wild i never saw any harm in the young man nor can i say i have heard any save what your worship now mentions
i wish indeed he was a little more regular in his responses at church but altogether he seems       ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudoris  that is a classical line young lady and being rendered into english is a lad of an ingenuous countenance and of an ingenuous modesty' for this was a virtue in great repute both among the latins and greeks
i must say the young gentleman for so i think i may call him notwithstanding his birth appears to me a very modest civil lad and i should be sorry that he should do himself any injury in squire allworthy's opinion  poogh says the squire injury with allworthy
why allworthy loves a wench himself
doth not all the country know whose son tom is
you must talk to another person in that manner
i remember allworthy at college  i thought said the parson he had never been at the university  yes yes he was says the squire and many a wench have we two had together
as arrant a whoremaster as any within five miles o'un
no no
it will do'n no harm with he assure yourself nor with anybody else
ask sophy thereyou have not the worse opinion of a young fellow for getting a bastard have you girl
no no the women will like un the better for't  this was a cruel question to poor sophia
she had observed tom's colour change at the parson's story and that with his hasty and abrupt departure gave her sufficient reason to think her father's suspicion not groundless
her heart now at once discovered the great secret to her which it had been so long disclosing by little and little and she found herself highly interested in this matter
in such a situation her father's malapert question rushing suddenly upon her produced some symptoms which might have alarmed a suspicious heart but to do the squire justice that was not his fault
when she rose therefore from her chair and told him a hint from him was always sufficient to make her withdraw he suffered her to leave the room and then with great gravity of countenance remarked that it was better to see a daughter overmodest than overforwarda sentiment which was highly applauded by the parson
there now ensued between the squire and the parson a most excellent political discourse framed out of newspapers and political pamphlets in which they made a libation of four bottles of wine to the good of their country and then the squire being fast asleep the parson lighted his pipe mounted his horse and rode home
when the squire had finished his halfhour's nap he summoned his daughter to her harpsichord but she begged to be excused that evening on account of a violent headache
this remission was presently granted for indeed she seldom had occasion to ask him twice as he loved her with such ardent affection that by gratifying her he commonly conveyed the highest gratification to himself
she was really what he frequently called her his little darling and she well deserved to be so for she returned all his affection in the most ample manner
she had preserved the most inviolable duty to him in all things and this her love made not only easy but so delightful that when one of her companions laughed at her for placing so much merit in such scrupulous obedience as that young lady called it sophia answered you mistake me madam if you think i value myself upon this account for besides that i am barely discharging my duty i am likewise pleasing myself
i can truly say i have no delight equal to that of contributing to my father's happiness and if i value myself my dear it is on having this power and not on executing it  this was a satisfaction however which poor sophia was incapable of tasting this evening
she therefore not only desired to be excused from her attendance at the harpsichord but likewise begged that he would suffer her to absent herself from supper
to this request likewise the squire agreed though not without some reluctance for he scarce ever permitted her to be out of his sight unless when he was engaged with his horses dogs or bottle
nevertheless he yielded to the desire of his daughter though the poor man was at the same time obliged to avoid his own company if i may so express myself by sending for a neighbouring farmer to sit with him
chapter xi
the narrow escape of molly seagrim with some observations for which we have been forced to dive pretty deep into nature
tom jones had ridden one of mr western's horses that morning in the chase so that having no horse of his own in the squire's stable he was obliged to go home on foot this he did so expeditiously that he ran upwards of three miles within the halfhour
just as he arrived at mr allworthy's outward gate he met the constable and company with molly in their possession whom they were conducting to that house where the inferior sort of people may learn one good lesson viz respect and deference to their superiors since it must show them the wide distinction fortune intends between those persons who are to be corrected for their faults and those who are not which lesson if they do not learn i am afraid they very rarely learn any other good lesson or improve their morals at the house of correction
a lawyer may perhaps think mr allworthy exceeded his authority a little in this instance
and to say the truth i question as here was no regular information before him whether his conduct was strictly regular
however as his intention was truly upright he ought to be excused in foro conscientiae since so many arbitrary acts are daily committed by magistrates who have not this excuse to plead for themselves
tom was no sooner informed by the constable whither they were proceeding indeed he pretty well guessed it of himself than he caught molly in his arms and embracing her tenderly before them all swore he would murder the first man who offered to lay hold of her
he bid her dry her eyes and be comforted for wherever she went he would accompany her
then turning to the constable who stood trembling with his hat off he desired him in a very mild voice to return with him for a moment only to his father for so he now called allworthy for he durst he said be assured that when he had alledged what he had to say in her favour the girl would be discharged
the constable who i make no doubt would have surrendered his prisoner had tom demanded her very readily consented to this request
so back they all went into mr allworthy's hall where tom desired them to stay till his return and then went himself in pursuit of the good man
as soon as he was found tom threw himself at his feet and having begged a patient hearing confessed himself to be the father of the child of which molly was then big
he entreated him to have compassion on the poor girl and to consider if there was any guilt in the case it lay principally at his door
if there is any guilt in the case answered allworthy warmly are you then so profligate and abandoned a libertine to doubt whether the breaking the laws of god and man the corrupting and ruining a poor girl be guilt
i own indeed it doth lie principally upon you and so heavy it is that you ought to expect it should crush you  whatever may be my fate says tom let me succeed in my intercessions for the poor girl
i confess i have corrupted her
but whether she shall be ruined depends on you
for heaven's sake sir revoke your warrant and do not send her to a place which must unavoidably prove her destruction  allworthy bid him immediately call a servant
tom answered there was no occasion for he had luckily met them at the gate and relying upon his goodness had brought them all back into his hall where they now waited his final resolution which upon his knees he besought him might be in favour of the girl that she might be permitted to go home to her parents and not be exposed to a greater degree of shame and scorn than must necessarily fall upon her
i know said he that is too much
i know i am the wicked occasion of it
i will endeavour to make amends if possible and if you shall have hereafter the goodness to forgive me i hope i shall deserve it  allworthy hesitated some time and at last said well i will discharge my mittimusyou may send the constable to me he was instantly called discharged and so was the girl
it will be believed that mr allworthy failed not to read tom a very severe lecture on this occasion but it is unnecessary to insert it here as we have faithfully transcribed what he said to jenny jones in the first book most of which may be applied to the men equally with the women
so sensible an effect had these reproofs on the young man who was no hardened sinner that he retired to his own room where he passed the evening alone in much melancholy contemplation
allworthy was sufficiently offended by this transgression of jones for notwithstanding the assertions of mr western it is certain this worthy man had never indulged himself in any loose pleasures with women and greatly condemned the vice of incontinence in others
indeed there is much reason to imagine that there was not the least truth in what mr western affirmed especially as he laid the scene of those impurities at the university where mr allworthy had never been
in fact the good squire was a little too apt to indulge that kind of pleasantry which is generally called rhodomontade but which may with as much propriety be expressed by a much shorter word and perhaps we too often supply the use of this little monosyllable by others since very much of what frequently passes in the world for wit and humour should in the strictest purity of language receive that short appellation which in conformity to the wellbred laws of custom i here suppress
but whatever detestation mr allworthy had to this or to any other vice he was not so blinded by it but that he could discern any virtue in the guilty person as clearly indeed as if there had been no mixture of vice in the same character
while he was angry therefore with the incontinence of jones he was no less pleased with the honour and honesty of his selfaccusation
he began now to form in his mind the same opinion of this young fellow which we hope our reader may have conceived
and in balancing his faults with his perfections the latter seemed rather to preponderate
it was to no purpose therefore that thwackum who was immediately charged by mr blifil with the story unbended all his rancour against poor tom
allworthy gave a patient hearing to their invectives and then answered coldly that young men of tom's complexion were too generally addicted to this vice but he believed that youth was sincerely affected with what he had said to him on the occasion and he hoped he would not transgress again so that as the days of whipping were at an end the tutor had no other vent but his own mouth for his gall the usual poor resource of impotent revenge
but square who was a less violent was a much more artful man and as he hated jones more perhaps than thwackum himself did so he contrived to do him more mischief in the mind of mr allworthy
the reader must remember the several little incidents of the partridge the horse and the bible which were recounted in the second book
by all which jones had rather improved than injured the affection which mr allworthy was inclined to entertain for him
the same i believe must have happened to him with every other person who hath any idea of friendship generosity and greatness of spirit that is to say who hath any traces of goodness in his mind
square himself was not unacquainted with the true impression which those several instances of goodness had made on the excellent heart of allworthy for the philosopher very well knew what virtue was though he was not always perhaps steady in its pursuit but as for thwackum from what reason i will not determine no such thoughts ever entered into his head he saw jones in a bad light and he imagined allworthy saw him in the same but that he was resolved from pride and stubbornness of spirit not to give up the boy whom he had once cherished since by so doing he must tacitly acknowledge that his former opinion of him had been wrong
square therefore embraced this opportunity of injuring jones in the tenderest part by giving a very bad turn to all these beforementioned occurrences
i am sorry sir said he to own i have been deceived as well as yourself
i could not i confess help being pleased with what i ascribed to the motive of friendship though it was carried to an excess and all excess is faulty and vicious but in this i made allowance for youth
little did i suspect that the sacrifice of truth which we both imagined to have been made to friendship was in reality a prostitution of it to a depraved and debauched appetite
you now plainly see whence all the seeming generosity of this young man to the family of the gamekeeper proceeded
he supported the father in order to corrupt the daughter and preserved the family from starving to bring one of them to shame and ruin
this is friendship
this is generosity
as sir richard steele says gluttons who give high prices for delicacies are very worthy to be called generous'
in short i am resolved from this instance never to give way to the weakness of human nature more nor to think anything virtue which doth not exactly quadrate with the unerring rule of right  the goodness of allworthy had prevented those considerations from occurring to himself yet were they too plausible to be absolutely and hastily rejected when laid before his eyes by another
indeed what square had said sunk very deeply into his mind and the uneasiness which it there created was very visible to the other though the good man would not acknowledge this but made a very slight answer and forcibly drove off the discourse to some other subject
it was well perhaps for poor tom that no such suggestions had been made before he was pardoned for they certainly stamped in the mind of allworthy the first bad impression concerning jones
chapter xii
containing much clearer matters but which flowed from the same fountain with those in the preceding chapter
the reader will be pleased i believe to return with me to sophia
she passed the night after we saw her last in no very agreeable manner
sleep befriended her but little and dreams less
in the morning when mrs honour her maid attended her at the usual hour she was found already up and drest
persons who live two or three miles' distance in the country are considered as nextdoor neighbours and transactions at the one house fly with incredible celerity to the other
mrs honour therefore had heard the whole story of molly's shame which she being of a very communicative temper had no sooner entered the apartment of her mistress than she began to relate in the following manner  la ma'am what doth your la'ship think
the girl that your la'ship saw at church on sunday whom you thought so handsome though you would not have thought her so handsome neither if you had seen her nearer but to be sure she hath been carried before the justice for being big with child
she seemed to me to look like a confident slut and to be sure she hath laid the child to young mr jones
and all the parish says mr allworthy is so angry with young mr jones that he won't see him
to be sure one can't help pitying the poor young man and yet he doth not deserve much pity neither for demeaning himself with such kind of trumpery
yet he is so pretty a gentleman i should be sorry to have him turned out of doors
i dares to swear the wench was as willing as he for she was always a forward kind of body
and when wenches are so coming young men are not so much to be blamed neither for to be sure they do no more than what is natural
indeed it is beneath them to meddle with such dirty draggletails and whatever happens to them it is good enough for them
and yet to be sure the vile baggages are most in fault
i wishes with all my heart they were well to be whipped at the cart's tail for it is pity they should be the ruin of a pretty young gentleman and nobody can deny but that mr jones is one of the most handsomest young men that ever  she was running on thus when sophia with a more peevish voice than she had ever spoken to her in before cried prithee why dost thou trouble me with all this stuff
what concern have i in what mr jones doth
i suppose you are all alike
and you seem to me to be angry it was not your own case  i ma'am answered mrs honour i am sorry your ladyship should have such an opinion of me
i am sure nobody can say any such thing of me
all the young fellows in the world may go to the divil for me
because i said he was a handsome man
everybody says it as well as i
to be sure i never thought as it was any harm to say a young man was handsome but to be sure i shall never think him so any more now for handsome is that handsome does
a beggar wench  stop thy torrent of impertinence cries sophia and see whether my father wants me at breakfast  mrs honour then flung out of the room muttering much to herself of which marry come up i assure you was all that could be plainly distinguished
whether mrs honour really deserved that suspicion of which her mistress gave her a hint is a matter which we cannot indulge our reader's curiosity by resolving
we will however make him amends in disclosing what passed in the mind of sophia
the reader will be pleased to recollect that a secret affection for mr jones had insensibly stolen into the bosom of this young lady
that it had there grown to a pretty great height before she herself had discovered it
when she first began to perceive its symptoms the sensations were so sweet and pleasing that she had not resolution sufficient to check or repel them and thus she went on cherishing a passion of which she never once considered the consequences
this incident relating to molly first opened her eyes
she now first perceived the weakness of which she had been guilty and though it caused the utmost perturbation in her mind yet it had the effect of other nauseous physic and for the time expelled her distemper
its operation indeed was most wonderfully quick and in the short interval while her maid was absent so entirely removed all symptoms that when mrs honour returned with a summons from her father she was become perfectly easy and had brought herself to a thorough indifference for mr jones
the diseases of the mind do in almost every particular imitate those of the body
for which reason we hope that learned faculty for whom we have so profound a respect will pardon us the violent hands we have been necessitated to lay on several words and phrases which of right belong to them and without which our descriptions must have been often unintelligible
now there is no one circumstance in which the distempers of the mind bear a more exact analogy to those which are called bodily than that aptness which both have to a relapse
this is plain in the violent diseases of ambition and avarice
i have known ambition when cured at court by frequent disappointments which are the only physic for it to break out again in a contest for foreman of the grand jury at an assizes and have heard of a man who had so far conquered avarice as to give away many a sixpence that comforted himself at last on his deathbed by making a crafty and advantageous bargain concerning his ensuing funeral with an undertaker who had married his only child
in the affair of love which out of strict conformity with the stoic philosophy we shall here treat as a disease this proneness to relapse is no less conspicuous
thus it happened to poor sophia upon whom the very next time she saw young jones all the former symptoms returned and from that time cold and hot fits alternately seized her heart
the situation of this young lady was now very different from what it had ever been before
that passion which had formerly been so exquisitely delicious became now a scorpion in her bosom
she resisted it therefore with her utmost force and summoned every argument her reason which was surprisingly strong for her age could suggest to subdue and expel it
in this she so far succeeded that she began to hope from time and absence a perfect cure
she resolved therefore to avoid tom jones as much as possible for which purpose she began to conceive a design of visiting her aunt to which she made no doubt of obtaining her father's consent
but fortune who had other designs in her head put an immediate stop to any such proceeding by introducing an accident which will be related in the next chapter
chapter xiii
a dreadful accident which befel sophia
the gallant behaviour of jones and the more dreadful consequence of that behaviour to the young lady with a short digression in favour of the female sex
mr western grew every day fonder and fonder of sophia insomuch that his beloved dogs themselves almost gave place to her in his affections but as he could not prevail on himself to abandon these he contrived very cunningly to enjoy their company together with that of his daughter by insisting on her riding a hunting with him
sophia to whom her father's word was a law readily complied with his desires though she had not the least delight in a sport which was of too rough and masculine a nature to suit with her disposition
she had however another motive beside her obedience to accompany the old gentleman in the chase for by her presence she hoped in some measure to restrain his impetuosity and to prevent him from so frequently exposing his neck to the utmost hazard
the strongest objection was that which would have formerly been an inducement to her namely the frequent meeting with young jones whom she had determined to avoid but as the end of the hunting season now approached she hoped by a short absence with her aunt to reason herself entirely out of her unfortunate passion and had not any doubt of being able to meet him in the field the subsequent season without the least danger
on the second day of her hunting as she was returning from the chase and was arrived within a little distance from mr western's house her horse whose mettlesome spirit required a better rider fell suddenly to prancing and capering in such a manner that she was in the most imminent peril of falling
tom jones who was at a little distance behind saw this and immediately galloped up to her assistance
as soon as he came up he leapt from his own horse and caught hold of hers by the bridle
the unruly beast presently reared himself an end on his hind legs and threw his lovely burthen from his back and jones caught her in his arms
she was so affected with the fright that she was not immediately able to satisfy jones who was very solicitous to know whether she had received any hurt
she soon after however recovered her spirits assured him she was safe and thanked him for the care he had taken of her
jones answered if i have preserved you madam i am sufficiently repaid for i promise you i would have secured you from the least harm at the expense of a much greater misfortune to myself than i have suffered on this occasion  what misfortune replied sophia eagerly i hope you have come to no mischief  be not concerned madam answered jones
heaven be praised you have escaped so well considering the danger you was in
if i have broke my arm i consider it as a trifle in comparison of what i feared upon your account  sophia then screamed out broke your arm
heaven forbid  i am afraid i have madam says jones but i beg you will suffer me first to take care of you
i have a right hand yet at your service to help you into the next field whence we have but a very little walk to your father's house  sophia seeing his left arm dangling by his side while he was using the other to lead her no longer doubted of the truth
she now grew much paler than her fears for herself had made her before
all her limbs were seized with a trembling insomuch that jones could scarce support her and as her thoughts were in no less agitation she could not refrain from giving jones a look so full of tenderness that it almost argued a stronger sensation in her mind than even gratitude and pity united can raise in the gentlest female bosom without the assistance of a third more powerful passion
mr western who was advanced at some distance when this accident happened was now returned as were the rest of the horsemen
sophia immediately acquainted them with what had befallen jones and begged them to take care of him
upon which western who had been much alarmed by meeting his daughter's horse without its rider and was now overjoyed to find her unhurt cried out i am glad it is no worse
if tom hath broken his arm we will get a joiner to mend un again  the squire alighted from his horse and proceeded to his house on foot with his daughter and jones
an impartial spectator who had met them on the way would on viewing their several countenances have concluded sophia alone to have been the object of compassion for as to jones he exulted in having probably saved the life of the young lady at the price only of a broken bone and mr western though he was not unconcerned at the accident which had befallen jones was however delighted in a much higher degree with the fortunate escape of his daughter
the generosity of sophia's temper construed this behaviour of jones into great bravery and it made a deep impression on her heart for certain it is that there is no one quality which so generally recommends men to women as this proceeding if we believe the common opinion from that natural timidity of the sex which is says mr osborne so great that a woman is the most cowardly of all the creatures god ever madea sentiment more remarkable for its bluntness than for its truth
aristotle in his politics doth them i believe more justice when he says the modesty and fortitude of men differ from those virtues in women for the fortitude which becomes a woman would be cowardice in a man and the modesty which becomes a man would be pertness in a woman nor is there perhaps more of truth in the opinion of those who derive the partiality which women are inclined to show to the brave from this excess of their fear
mr bayle i think in his article of helen imputes this and with greater probability to their violent love of glory for the truth of which we have the authority of him who of all others saw farthest into human nature and who introduces the heroine of his odyssey the great pattern of matrimonial love and constancy assigning the glory of her husband as the only source of her affection towards him
     the english reader will not find this in the poem for the   sentiment is entirely left out in the translation
however this be certain it is that the accident operated very strongly on sophia and indeed after much enquiry into the matter i am inclined to believe that at this very time the charming sophia made no less impression on the heart of jones to say truth he had for some time become sensible of the irresistible power of her charms
chapter xiv
the arrival of a surgeonhis operations and a long dialogue between sophia and her maid
when they arrived at mr western's hall sophia who had tottered along with much difficulty sunk down in her chair but by the assistance of hartshorn and water she was prevented from fainting away and had pretty well recovered her spirits when the surgeon who was sent for to jones appeared
mr western who imputed these symptoms in his daughter to her fall advised her to be presently blooded by way of prevention
in this opinion he was seconded by the surgeon who gave so many reasons for bleeding and quoted so many cases where persons had miscarried for want of it that the squire became very importunate and indeed insisted peremptorily that his daughter should be blooded
sophia soon yielded to the commands of her father though entirely contrary to her own inclinations for she suspected i believe less danger from the fright than either the squire or the surgeon
she then stretched out her beautiful arm and the operator began to prepare for his work
while the servants were busied in providing materials the surgeon who imputed the backwardness which had appeared in sophia to her fears began to comfort her with assurances that there was not the least danger for no accident he said could ever happen in bleeding but from the monstrous ignorance of pretenders to surgery which he pretty plainly insinuated was not at present to be apprehended
sophia declared she was not under the least apprehension adding if you open an artery i promise you i'll forgive you will you cries western dn me if i will
if he does thee the least mischief dn me if i don't ha' the heart's blood o'un out the surgeon assented to bleed her upon these conditions and then proceeded to his operation which he performed with as much dexterity as he had promised and with as much quickness for he took but little blood from her saying it was much safer to bleed again and again than to take away too much at once
sophia when her arm was bound up retired for she was not willing nor was it perhaps strictly decent to be present at the operation on jones
indeed one objection which she had to bleeding though she did not make it was the delay which it would occasion to setting the broken bone
for western when sophia was concerned had no consideration but for her and as for jones himself he sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief to say the truth when he saw the blood springing from the lovely arm of sophia he scarce thought of what had happened to himself
the surgeon now ordered his patient to be stript to his shirt and then entirely baring the arm he began to stretch and examine it in such a manner that the tortures he put him to caused jones to make several wry faces which the surgeon observing greatly wondered at crying what is the matter sir
i am sure it is impossible i should hurt you and then holding forth the broken arm he began a long and very learned lecture of anatomy in which simple and double fractures were most accurately considered and the several ways in which jones might have broken his arm were discussed with proper annotations showing how many of these would have been better and how many worse than the present case
having at length finished his laboured harangue with which the audience though it had greatly raised their attention and admiration were not much edified as they really understood not a single syllable of all he had said he proceeded to business which he was more expeditious in finishing than he had been in beginning
jones was then ordered into a bed which mr western compelled him to accept at his own house and sentence of watergruel was passed upon him
among the good company which had attended in the hall during the bonesetting mrs honour was one who being summoned to her mistress as soon as it was over and asked by her how the young gentleman did presently launched into extravagant praises on the magnanimity as she called it of his behaviour which she said was so charming in so pretty a creature she then burst forth into much warmer encomiums on the beauty of his person enumerating many particulars and ending with the whiteness of his skin
this discourse had an effect on sophia's countenance which would not perhaps have escaped the observance of the sagacious waitingwoman had she once looked her mistress in the face all the time she was speaking but as a lookingglass which was most commodiously placed opposite to her gave her an opportunity of surveying those features in which of all others she took most delight so she had not once removed her eyes from that amiable object during her whole speech
mrs honour was so intirely wrapped up in the subject on which she exercised her tongue and the object before her eyes that she gave her mistress time to conquer her confusion which having done she smiled on her maid and told her she was certainly in love with this young fellowi in love madam answers she upon my word ma'am i assure you ma'am upon my soul ma'am i am notwhy if you was cries her mistress i see no reason that you should be ashamed of it for he is certainly a pretty fellowyes ma'am answered the other that he is the most handsomest man i ever saw in my life
yes to be sure that he is and as your ladyship says i don't know why i should be ashamed of loving him though he is my betters
to be sure gentlefolks are but flesh and blood no more than us servants
besides as for mr jones thof squire allworthy hath made a gentleman of him he was not so good as myself by birth for thof i am a poor body i am an honest person's child and my father and mother were married which is more than some people can say as high as they hold their heads
marry come up
i assure you my dirty cousin
thof his skin be so white and to be sure it is the most whitest that ever was seen i am a christian as well as he and nobody can say that i am base born my grandfather was a clergyman and would have been very angry i believe to have thought any of his family should have taken up with molly seagrim's dirty leavings     this is the second person of low condition whom we have recorded   in this history to have sprung from the clergy
it is to be hoped   such instances will in future ages when some provision is made for   the families of the inferior clergy appear stranger than they can   be thought at present
perhaps sophia might have suffered her maid to run on in this manner from wanting sufficient spirits to stop her tongue which the reader may probably conjecture was no very easy task for certainly there were some passages in her speech which were far from being agreeable to the lady
however she now checked the torrent as there seemed no end of its flowing
i wonder says she at your assurance in daring to talk thus of one of my father's friends
as to the wench i order you never to mention her name to me
and with regard to the young gentleman's birth those who can say nothing more to his disadvantage may as well be silent on that head as i desire you will be for the future  i am sorry i have offended your ladyship answered mrs honour
i am sure i hate molly seagrim as much as your ladyship can and as for abusing squire jones i can call all the servants in the house to witness that whenever any talk hath been about bastards i have always taken his part for which of you says i to the footmen would not be a bastard if he could to be made a gentleman of
and says i i am sure he is a very fine gentleman and he hath one of the whitest hands in the world for to be sure so he hath and says i one of the sweetest temperedest best naturedest men in the world he is and says i all the servants and neighbours all round the country loves him
and to be sure i could tell your ladyship something but that i am afraid it would offend youwhat could you tell me honour  says sophia
nay ma'am to be sure he meant nothing by it therefore i would not have your ladyship be offendedprithee tell me says sophia i will know it this instantwhy ma'am answered mrs honour he came into the room one day last week when i was at work and there lay your ladyship's muff on a chair and to be sure he put his hands into it that very muff your ladyship gave me but yesterday
la
says i mr jones you will stretch my lady's muff and spoil it but he still kept his hands in it and then he kissed itto be sure i hardly ever saw such a kiss in my life as he gave iti suppose he did not know it was mine replied sophia
your ladyship shall hear ma'am
he kissed it again and again and said it was the prettiest muff in the world
la
sir says i you have seen it a hundred times
yes mrs honour cried he but who can see anything beautiful in the presence of your lady but herselfnay that's not all neither but i hope your ladyship won't be offended for to be sure he meant nothing
one day as your ladyship was playing on the harpsichord to my master mr jones was sitting in the next room and methought he looked melancholy
la
says i mr jones what's the matter
a penny for your thoughts says i
why hussy says he starting up from a dream what can i be thinking of when that angel your mistress is playing
and then squeezing me by the hand oh
mrs honour says he how happy will that man beand then he sighed
upon my troth his breath is as sweet as a nosegaybut to be sure he meant no harm by it
so i hope your ladyship will not mention a word for he gave me a crown never to mention it and made me swear upon a book but i believe indeed it was not the bible  till something of a more beautiful red than vermilion be found out i shall say nothing of sophia's colour on this occasion
honour  says she iif you will not mention this any more to menor to anybody else i will not betray youi mean i will not be angry but i am afraid of your tongue
why my girl will you give it such libertiesnay ma'am answered she to be sure i would sooner cut out my tongue than offend your ladyship
to be sure i shall never mention a word that your ladyship would not have mewhy i would not have you mention this any more said sophia for it may come to my father's ears and he would be angry with mr jones though i really believe as you say he meant nothing
i should be very angry myself if i imaginednay ma'am says honour i protest i believe he meant nothing
i thought he talked as if he was out of his senses nay he said he believed he was beside himself when he had spoken the words
ay sir says i i believe so too
yes says he honourbut i ask your ladyship's pardon i could tear my tongue out for offending you go on says sophia you may mention anything you have not told me beforeyes honour says he this was some time afterwards when he gave me the crown i am neither such a coxcomb or such a villain as to think of her in any other delight but as my goddess as such i will always worship and adore her while i have breaththis was all ma'am i will be sworn to the best of my remembrance
i was in a passion with him myself till i found he meant no harmindeed honour says sophia i believe you have a real affection for me
i was provoked the other day when i gave you warning but if you have a desire to stay with me you shallto be sure ma'am answered mrs honour i shall never desire to part with your ladyship
to be sure i almost cried my eyes out when you gave me warning
it would be very ungrateful in me to desire to leave your ladyship because as why i should never get so good a place again
i am sure i would live and die with your ladyship for as poor mr jones said happy is the man  here the dinner bell interrupted a conversation which had wrought such an effect on sophia that she was perhaps more obliged to her bleeding in the morning than she at the time had apprehended she should be
as to the present situation of her mind i shall adhere to a rule of horace by not attempting to describe it from despair of success
most of my readers will suggest it easily to themselves and the few who cannot would not understand the picture or at least would deny it to be natural if ever so well drawn

chapter i
of the serious in writing and for what purpose it is introduced
peradventure there may be no parts in this prodigious work which will give the reader less pleasure in the perusing than those which have given the author the greatest pains in composing
among these probably may be reckoned those initial essays which we have prefixed to the historical matter contained in every book and which we have determined to be essentially necessary to this kind of writing of which we have set ourselves at the head
for this our determination we do not hold ourselves strictly bound to assign any reason it being abundantly sufficient that we have laid it down as a rule necessary to be observed in all prosaicomiepic writing
who ever demanded the reasons of that nice unity of time or place which is now established to be so essential to dramatic poetry
what critic hath been ever asked why a play may not contain two days as well as one
or why the audience provided they travel like electors without any expense may not be wafted fifty miles as well as five
hath any commentator well accounted for the limitation which an antient critic hath set to the drama which he will have contain neither more nor less than five acts
or hath any one living attempted to explain what the modern judges of our theatres mean by that word low by which they have happily succeeded in banishing all humour from the stage and have made the theatre as dull as a drawingroom
upon all these occasions the world seems to have embraced a maxim of our law viz cuicunque in arte sua perito credendum est for it seems perhaps difficult to conceive that any one should have had enough of impudence to lay down dogmatical rules in any art or science without the least foundation
in such cases therefore we are apt to conclude there are sound and good reasons at the bottom though we are unfortunately not able to see so far
now in reality the world have paid too great a compliment to critics and have imagined them men of much greater profundity than they really are
from this complacence the critics have been emboldened to assume a dictatorial power and have so far succeeded that they are now become the masters and have the assurance to give laws to those authors from whose predecessors they originally received them
the critic rightly considered is no more than the clerk whose office it is to transcribe the rules and laws laid down by those great judges whose vast strength of genius hath placed them in the light of legislators in the several sciences over which they presided
this office was all which the critics of old aspired to nor did they ever dare to advance a sentence without supporting it by the authority of the judge from whence it was borrowed
but in process of time and in ages of ignorance the clerk began to invade the power and assume the dignity of his master
the laws of writing were no longer founded on the practice of the author but on the dictates of the critic
the clerk became the legislator and those very peremptorily gave laws whose business it was at first only to transcribe them
hence arose an obvious and perhaps an unavoidable error for these critics being men of shallow capacities very easily mistook mere form for substance
they acted as a judge would who should adhere to the lifeless letter of law and reject the spirit
little circumstances which were perhaps accidental in a great author were by these critics considered to constitute his chief merit and transmitted as essentials to be observed by all his successors
to these encroachments time and ignorance the two great supporters of imposture gave authority and thus many rules for good writing have been established which have not the least foundation in truth or nature and which commonly serve for no other purpose than to curb and restrain genius in the same manner as it would have restrained the dancingmaster had the many excellent treatises on that art laid it down as an essential rule that every man must dance in chains
to avoid therefore all imputation of laying down a rule for posterity founded only on the authority of ipse dixitfor which to say the truth we have not the profoundest venerationwe shall here waive the privilege above contended for and proceed to lay before the reader the reasons which have induced us to intersperse these several digressive essays in the course of this work
and here we shall of necessity be led to open a new vein of knowledge which if it hath been discovered hath not to our remembrance been wrought on by any antient or modern writer
this vein is no other than that of contrast which runs through all the works of the creation and may probably have a large share in constituting in us the idea of all beauty as well natural as artificial for what demonstrates the beauty and excellence of anything but its reverse
thus the beauty of day and that of summer is set off by the horrors of night and winter
and i believe if it was possible for a man to have seen only the two former he would have a very imperfect idea of their beauty
but to avoid too serious an air can it be doubted but that the finest woman in the world would lose all benefit of her charms in the eye of a man who had never seen one of another cast
the ladies themselves seem so sensible of this that they are all industrious to procure foils nay they will become foils to themselves for i have observed at bath particularly that they endeavour to appear as ugly as possible in the morning in order to set off that beauty which they intend to show you in the evening
most artists have this secret in practice though some perhaps have not much studied the theory
the jeweller knows that the finest brilliant requires a foil and the painter by the contrast of his figures often acquires great applause
a great genius among us will illustrate this matter fully
i cannot indeed range him under any general head of common artists as he hath a title to be placed among those         inventas qui vitam excoluere per artes         who by invented arts have life improved
i mean here the inventor of that most exquisite entertainment called the english pantomime
this entertainment consisted of two parts which the inventor distinguished by the names of the serious and the comic
the serious exhibited a certain number of heathen gods and heroes who were certainly the worst and dullest company into which an audience was ever introduced and which was a secret known to few were actually intended so to be in order to contrast the comic part of the entertainment and to display the tricks of harlequin to the better advantage
this was perhaps no very civil use of such personages but the contrivance was nevertheless ingenious enough and had its effect
and this will now plainly appear if instead of serious and comic we supply the words duller and dullest for the comic was certainly duller than anything before shown on the stage and could be set off only by that superlative degree of dulness which composed the serious
so intolerably serious indeed were these gods and heroes that harlequin though the english gentleman of that name is not at all related to the french family for he is of a much more serious disposition was always welcome on the stage as he relieved the audience from worse company
judicious writers have always practised this art of contrast with great success
i have been surprized that horace should cavil at this art in homer but indeed he contradicts himself in the very next line       indignor quandoque bonus dormitat homerus      verum opere in longo fas est obrepere somnum       i grieve if e'er great homer chance to sleep      yet slumbers on long works have right to creep
for we are not here to understand as perhaps some have that an author actually falls asleep while he is writing
it is true that readers are too apt to be so overtaken but if the work was as long as any of oldmixon the author himself is too well entertained to be subject to the least drowsiness
he is as mr pope observes       sleepless himself to give his readers sleep
to say the truth these soporific parts are so many scenes of serious artfully interwoven in order to contrast and set off the rest and this is the true meaning of a late facetious writer who told the public that whenever he was dull they might be assured there was a design in it
in this light then or rather in this darkness i would have the reader to consider these initial essays
and after this warning if he shall be of opinion that he can find enough of serious in other parts of this history he may pass over these in which we profess to be laboriously dull and begin the following books at the second chapter
chapter ii
in which mr jones receives many friendly visits during his confinement with some fine touches of the passion of love scarce visible to the naked eye
tom jones had many visitors during his confinement though some perhaps were not very agreeable to him
mr allworthy saw him almost every day but though he pitied tom's sufferings and greatly approved the gallant behaviour which had occasioned them yet he thought this was a favourable opportunity to bring him to a sober sense of his indiscreet conduct and that wholesome advice for that purpose could never be applied at a more proper season than at the present when the mind was softened by pain and sickness and alarmed by danger and when its attention was unembarrassed with those turbulent passions which engage us in the pursuit of pleasure
at all seasons therefore when the good man was alone with the youth especially when the latter was totally at ease he took occasion to remind him of his former miscarriages but in the mildest and tenderest manner and only in order to introduce the caution which he prescribed for his future behaviour on which alone he assured him would depend his own felicity and the kindness which he might yet promise himself to receive at the hands of his father by adoption unless he should hereafter forfeit his good opinion for as to what had past he said it should be all forgiven and forgotten
he therefore advised him to make a good use of this accident that so in the end it might prove a visitation for his own good  thwackum was likewise pretty assiduous in his visits and he too considered a sickbed to be a convenient scene for lectures
his stile however was more severe than mr allworthy's he told his pupil that he ought to look on his broken limb as a judgment from heaven on his sins
that it would become him to be daily on his knees pouring forth thanksgivings that he had broken his arm only and not his neck which latter he said was very probably reserved for some future occasion and that perhaps not very remote
for his part he said he had often wondered some judgment had not overtaken him before but it might be perceived by this that divine punishments though slow are always sure hence likewise he advised him to foresee with equal certainty the greater evils which were yet behind and which were as sure as this of overtaking him in his state of reprobacy
these are said he to be averted only by such a thorough and sincere repentance as is not to be expected or hoped for from one so abandoned in his youth and whose mind i am afraid is totally corrupted
it is my duty however to exhort you to this repentance though i too well know all exhortations will be vain and fruitless
but liberavi animam meam i can accuse my own conscience of no neglect though it is at the same time with the utmost concern i see you travelling on to certain misery in this world and to as certain damnation in the next  square talked in a very different strain he said such accidents as a broken bone were below the consideration of a wise man
that it was abundantly sufficient to reconcile the mind to any of these mischances to reflect that they are liable to befal the wisest of mankind and are undoubtedly for the good of the whole he said it was a mere abuse of words to call those things evils in which there was no moral unfitness that pain which was the worst consequence of such accidents was the most contemptible thing in the world with more of the like sentences extracted out of the second book of tully's tusculan questions and from the great lord shaftesbury
in pronouncing these he was one day so eager that he unfortunately bit his tongue and in such a manner that it not only put an end to his discourse but created much emotion in him and caused him to mutter an oath or two but what was worst of all this accident gave thwackum who was present and who held all such doctrine to be heathenish and atheistical an opportunity to clap a judgment on his back
now this was done with so malicious a sneer that it totally unhinged if i may so say the temper of the philosopher which the bite of his tongue had somewhat ruffled and as he was disabled from venting his wrath at his lips he had possibly found a more violent method of revenging himself had not the surgeon who was then luckily in the room contrary to his own interest interposed and preserved the peace
mr blifil visited his friend jones but seldom and never alone
this worthy young man however professed much regard for him and as great concern at his misfortune but cautiously avoided any intimacy lest as he frequently hinted it might contaminate the sobriety of his own character for which purpose he had constantly in his mouth that proverb in which solomon speaks against evil communication
not that he was so bitter as thwackum for he always expressed some hopes of tom's reformation which he said the unparalleled goodness shown by his uncle on this occasion must certainly effect in one not absolutely abandoned but concluded if mr jones ever offends hereafter i shall not be able to say a syllable in his favour  as to squire western he was seldom out of the sickroom unless when he was engaged either in the field or over his bottle
nay he would sometimes retire hither to take his beer and it was not without difficulty that he was prevented from forcing jones to take his beer too for no quack ever held his nostrum to be a more general panacea than he did this which he said had more virtue in it than was in all the physic in an apothecary's shop
he was however by much entreaty prevailed on to forbear the application of this medicine but from serenading his patient every hunting morning with the horn under his window it was impossible to withhold him nor did he ever lay aside that hallow with which he entered into all companies when he visited jones without any regard to the sick person's being at that time either awake or asleep
this boisterous behaviour as it meant no harm so happily it effected none and was abundantly compensated to jones as soon as he was able to sit up by the company of sophia whom the squire then brought to visit him nor was it indeed long before jones was able to attend her to the harpsichord where she would kindly condescend for hours together to charm him with the most delicious music unless when the squire thought proper to interrupt her by insisting on old sir simon or some other of his favourite pieces
notwithstanding the nicest guard which sophia endeavoured to set on her behaviour she could not avoid letting some appearances now and then slip forth for love may again be likened to a disease in this that when it is denied a vent in one part it will certainly break out in another
what her lips therefore concealed her eyes her blushes and many little involuntary actions betrayed
one day when sophia was playing on the harpsichord and jones was attending the squire came into the room crying there tom i have had a battle for thee belowstairs with thick parson thwackum
he hath been a telling allworthy before my face that the broken bone was a judgment upon thee
dn it says i how can that be
did he not come by it in defence of a young woman
a judgment indeed
pox if he never doth anything worse he will go to heaven sooner than all the parsons in the country
he hath more reason to glory in it than to be ashamed of itindeed sir says jones i have no reason for either but if it preserved miss western i shall always think it the happiest accident of my lifeand to gu said the squire to zet allworthy against thee vor it
dn un if the parson had unt his petticuoats on i should have lent un o flick for i love thee dearly my boy and dn me if there is anything in my power which i won't do for thee
sha't take thy choice of all the horses in my stable tomorrow morning except only the chevalier and miss slouch jones thanked him but declined accepting the offer
nay added the squire sha't ha the sorrel mare that sophy rode
she cost me fifty guineas and comes six years old this grass if she had cost me a thousand  cries jones passionately i would have given her to the dogs pooh
pooh answered western what
because she broke thy arm
shouldst forget and forgive
i thought hadst been more a man than to bear malice against a dumb creaturehere sophia interposed and put an end to the conversation by desiring her father's leave to play to him a request which he never refused
the countenance of sophia had undergone more than one change during the foregoing speeches and probably she imputed the passionate resentment which jones had expressed against the mare to a different motive from that from which her father had derived it
her spirits were at this time in a visible flutter and she played so intolerably ill that had not western soon fallen asleep he must have remarked it
jones however who was sufficiently awake and was not without an ear any more than without eyes made some observations which being joined to all which the reader may remember to have passed formerly gave him pretty strong assurances when he came to reflect on the whole that all was not well in the tender bosom of sophia an opinion which many young gentlemen will i doubt not extremely wonder at his not having been well confirmed in long ago
to confess the truth he had rather too much diffidence in himself and was not forward enough in seeing the advances of a young lady a misfortune which can be cured only by that early town education which is at present so generally in fashion
when these thoughts had fully taken possession of jones they occasioned a perturbation in his mind which in a constitution less pure and firm than his might have been at such a season attended with very dangerous consequences
he was truly sensible of the great worth of sophia
he extremely liked her person no less admired her accomplishments and tenderly loved her goodness
in reality as he had never once entertained any thought of possessing her nor had ever given the least voluntary indulgence to his inclinations he had a much stronger passion for her than he himself was acquainted with
his heart now brought forth the full secret at the same time that it assured him the adorable object returned his affection
chapter iii
which all who have no heart will think to contain much ado about nothing
the reader will perhaps imagine the sensations which now arose in jones to have been so sweet and delicious that they would rather tend to produce a chearful serenity in the mind than any of those dangerous effects which we have mentioned but in fact sensations of this kind however delicious are at their first recognition of a very tumultuous nature and have very little of the opiate in them
they were moreover in the present case embittered with certain circumstances which being mixed with sweeter ingredients tended altogether to compose a draught that might be termed bittersweet than which as nothing can be more disagreeable to the palate so nothing in the metaphorical sense can be so injurious to the mind
for first though he had sufficient foundation to flatter himself in what he had observed in sophia he was not yet free from doubt of misconstruing compassion or at best esteem into a warmer regard
he was far from a sanguine assurance that sophia had any such affection towards him as might promise his inclinations that harvest which if they were encouraged and nursed they would finally grow up to require
besides if he could hope to find no bar to his happiness from the daughter he thought himself certain of meeting an effectual bar in the father who though he was a country squire in his diversions was perfectly a man of the world in whatever regarded his fortune had the most violent affection for his only daughter and had often signified in his cups the pleasure he proposed in seeing her married to one of the richest men in the county
jones was not so vain and senseless a coxcomb as to expect from any regard which western had professed for him that he would ever be induced to lay aside these views of advancing his daughter
he well knew that fortune is generally the principal if not the sole consideration which operates on the best of parents in these matters for friendship makes us warmly espouse the interest of others but it is very cold to the gratification of their passions
indeed to feel the happiness which may result from this it is necessary we should possess the passion ourselves
as he had therefore no hopes of obtaining her father's consent so he thought to endeavour to succeed without it and by such means to frustrate the great point of mr western's life was to make a very ill use of his hospitality and a very ungrateful return to the many little favours received however roughly at his hands
if he saw such a consequence with horror and disdain how much more was he shocked with what regarded mr allworthy to whom as he had more than filial obligations so had he for him more than filial piety
he knew the nature of that good man to be so averse to any baseness or treachery that the least attempt of such a kind would make the sight of the guilty person for ever odious to his eyes and his name a detestable sound in his ears
the appearance of such unsurmountable difficulties was sufficient to have inspired him with despair however ardent his wishes had been but even these were contruoled by compassion for another woman
the idea of lovely molly now intruded itself before him
he had sworn eternal constancy in her arms and she had as often vowed never to outlive his deserting her
he now saw her in all the most shocking postures of death nay he considered all the miseries of prostitution to which she would be liable and of which he would be doubly the occasion first by seducing and then by deserting her for he well knew the hatred which all her neighbours and even her own sisters bore her and how ready they would all be to tear her to pieces
indeed he had exposed her to more envy than shame or rather to the latter by means of the former for many women abused her for being a whore while they envied her her lover and her finery and would have been themselves glad to have purchased these at the same rate
the ruin therefore of the poor girl must he foresaw unavoidably attend his deserting her and this thought stung him to the soul
poverty and distress seemed to him to give none a right of aggravating those misfortunes
the meanness of her condition did not represent her misery as of little consequence in his eyes nor did it appear to justify or even to palliate his guilt in bringing that misery upon her
but why do i mention justification
his own heart would not suffer him to destroy a human creature who he thought loved him and had to that love sacrificed her innocence
his own good heart pleaded her cause not as a cold venal advocate but as one interested in the event and which must itself deeply share in all the agonies its owner brought on another
when this powerful advocate had sufficiently raised the pity of jones by painting poor molly in all the circumstances of wretchedness it artfully called in the assistance of another passion and represented the girl in all the amiable colours of youth health and beauty as one greatly the object of desire and much more so at least to a good mind from being at the same time the object of compassion
amidst these thoughts poor jones passed a long sleepless night and in the morning the result of the whole was to abide by molly and to think no more of sophia
in this virtuous resolution he continued all the next day till the evening cherishing the idea of molly and driving sophia from his thoughts but in the fatal evening a very trifling accident set all his passions again on float and worked so total a change in his mind that we think it decent to communicate it in a fresh chapter
chapter iv
a little chapter in which is contained a little incident
among other visitants who paid their compliments to the young gentleman in his confinement mrs honour was one
the reader perhaps when he reflects on some expressions which have formerly dropt from her may conceive that she herself had a very particular affection for mr jones but in reality it was no such thing
tom was a handsome young fellow and for that species of men mrs honour had some regard but this was perfectly indiscriminate for having being crossed in the love which she bore a certain nobleman's footman who had basely deserted her after a promise of marriage she had so securely kept together the broken remains of her heart that no man had ever since been able to possess himself of any single fragment
she viewed all handsome men with that equal regard and benevolence which a sober and virtuous mind bears to all the good
she might indeed be called a lover of men as socrates was a lover of mankind preferring one to another for corporeal as he for mental qualifications but never carrying this preference so far as to cause any perturbation in the philosophical serenity of her temper
the day after mr jones had that conflict with himself which we have seen in the preceding chapter mrs honour came into his room and finding him alone began in the following mannerla sir where do you think i have been
i warrants you you would not guess in fifty years but if you did guess to be sure i must not tell you neithernay if it be something which you must not tell me said jones i shall have the curiosity to enquire and i know you will not be so barbarous to refuse mei don't know cries she why i should refuse you neither for that matter for to be sure you won't mention it any more
and for that matter if you knew where i have been unless you knew what i have been about it would not signify much
nay i don't see why it should be kept a secret for my part for to be sure she is the best lady in the world upon this jones began to beg earnestly to be let into this secret and faithfully promised not to divulge it
she then proceeded thuswhy you must know sir my young lady sent me to enquire after molly seagrim and to see whether the wench wanted anything to be sure i did not care to go methinks but servants must do what they are orderedhow could you undervalue yourself so mr jonesso my lady bid me go and carry her some linen and other things
she is too good
if such forward sluts were sent to bridewell it would be better for them
i told my lady says i madam your la'ship is encouraging idlenessand was my sophia so good says jones
my sophia
i assure you marry come up  answered honour
and yet if you knew allindeed if i was as mr jones i should look a little higher than such trumpery as molly seagrim what do you mean by these words replied jones if i knew all i mean what i mean says honour
don't you remember putting your hands in my lady's muff once
i vow i could almost find in my heart to tell if i was certain my lady would never come to the hearing on't jones then made several solemn protestations
and honour proceededthen to be sure my lady gave me that muff and afterwards upon hearing what you had donethen you told her what i had done interrupted jones
if i did sir answered she you need not be angry with me
many's the man would have given his head to have had my lady told if they had knownfor to be sure the biggest lord in the land might be proudbut i protest i have a great mind not to tell you jones fell to entreaties and soon prevailed on her to go on thus
you must know then sir that my lady had given this muff to me but about a day or two after i had told her the story she quarrels with her new muff and to be sure it is the prettiest that ever was seen
honour says she this is an odious muff it is too big for me i can't wear it till i can get another you must let me have my old one again and you may have this in the room on'tfor she's a good lady and scorns to give a thing and take a thing i promise you that
so to be sure i fetched it her back again and i believe she hath worn it upon her arm almost ever since and i warrants hath given it many a kiss when nobody hath seen her  here the conversation was interrupted by mr western himself who came to summon jones to the harpsichord whither the poor young fellow went all pale and trembling
this western observed but on seeing mrs honour imputed it to a wrong cause and having given jones a hearty curse between jest and earnest he bid him beat abroad and not poach up the game in his warren
sophia looked this evening with more than usual beauty and we may believe it was no small addition to her charms in the eye of mr jones that she now happened to have on her right arm this very muff
she was playing one of her father's favourite tunes and he was leaning on her chair when the muff fell over her fingers and put her out
this so disconcerted the squire that he snatched the muff from her and with a hearty curse threw it into the fire
sophia instantly started up and with the utmost eagerness recovered it from the flames
though this incident will probably appear of little consequence to many of our readers yet trifling as it was it had so violent an effect on poor jones that we thought it our duty to relate it
in reality there are many little circumstances too often omitted by injudicious historians from which events of the utmost importance arise
the world may indeed be considered as a vast machine in which the great wheels are originally set in motion by those which are very minute and almost imperceptible to any but the strongest eyes
thus not all the charms of the incomparable sophia not all the dazzling brightness and languishing softness of her eyes the harmony of her voice and of her person not all her wit goodhumour greatness of mind or sweetness of disposition had been able so absolutely to conquer and enslave the heart of poor jones as this little incident of the muff
thus the poet sweetly sings of troy        captique dolis lachrymisque coacti       quos neque tydides nec larissaeus achilles       non anni domuere decem non mille carinae        what diomede or thetis' greater son       a thousand ships nor ten years' siege had done       false tears and fawning words the city won
the citadel of jones was now taken by surprize
all those considerations of honour and prudence which our heroe had lately with so much military wisdom placed as guards over the avenues of his heart ran away from their posts and the god of love marched in in triumph
chapter v  a very long chapter containing a very great incident
but though this victorious deity easily expelled his avowed enemies from the heart of jones he found it more difficult to supplant the garrison which he himself had placed there
to lay aside all allegory the concern for what must become of poor molly greatly disturbed and perplexed the mind of the worthy youth
the superior merit of sophia totally eclipsed or rather extinguished all the beauties of the poor girl but compassion instead of contempt succeeded to love
he was convinced the girl had placed all her affections and all her prospect of future happiness in him only
for this he had he knew given sufficient occasion by the utmost profusion of tenderness towards her a tenderness which he had taken every means to persuade her he would always maintain
she on her side had assured him of her firm belief in his promise and had with the most solemn vows declared that on his fulfilling or breaking these promises it depended whether she should be the happiest or most miserable of womankind
and to be the author of this highest degree of misery to a human being was a thought on which he could not bear to ruminate a single moment
he considered this poor girl as having sacrificed to him everything in her little power as having been at her own expense the object of his pleasure as sighing and languishing for him even at that very instant
shall then says he my recovery for which she hath so ardently wished shall my presence which she hath so eagerly expected instead of giving her that joy with which she hath flattered herself cast her at once down into misery and despair
can i be such a villain
here when the genius of poor molly seemed triumphant the love of sophia towards him which now appeared no longer dubious rushed upon his mind and bore away every obstacle before it
at length it occurred to him that he might possibly be able to make molly amends another way namely by giving her a sum of money
this nevertheless he almost despaired of her accepting when he recollected the frequent and vehement assurances he had received from her that the world put in balance with him would make her no amends for his loss
however her extreme poverty and chiefly her egregious vanity somewhat of which hath been already hinted to the reader gave him some little hope that notwithstanding all her avowed tenderness she might in time be brought to content herself with a fortune superior to her expectation and which might indulge her vanity by setting her above all her equals
he resolved therefore to take the first opportunity of making a proposal of this kind
one day accordingly when his arm was so well recovered that he could walk easily with it slung in a sash he stole forth at a season when the squire was engaged in his field exercises and visited his fair one
her mother and sisters whom he found taking their tea informed him first that molly was not at home but afterwards the eldest sister acquainted him with a malicious smile that she was above stairs abed
tom had no objection to this situation of his mistress and immediately ascended the ladder which led towards her bedchamber but when he came to the top he to his great surprize found the door fast nor could he for some time obtain any answer from within for molly as she herself afterwards informed him was fast asleep
the extremes of grief and joy have been remarked to produce very similar effects and when either of these rushes on us by surprize it is apt to create such a total perturbation and confusion that we are often thereby deprived of the use of all our faculties
it cannot therefore be wondered at that the unexpected sight of mr jones should so strongly operate on the mind of molly and should overwhelm her with such confusion that for some minutes she was unable to express the great raptures with which the reader will suppose she was affected on this occasion
as for jones he was so entirely possessed and as it were enchanted by the presence of his beloved object that he for a while forgot sophia and consequently the principal purpose of his visit
this however soon recurred to his memory and after the first transports of their meeting were over he found means by degrees to introduce a discourse on the fatal consequences which must attend their amour if mr allworthy who had strictly forbidden him ever seeing her more should discover that he still carried on this commerce
such a discovery which his enemies gave him reason to think would be unavoidable must he said end in his ruin and consequently in hers
since therefore their hard fates had determined that they must separate he advised her to bear it with resolution and swore he would never omit any opportunity through the course of his life of showing her the sincerity of his affection by providing for her in a manner beyond her utmost expectation or even beyond her wishes if ever that should be in his power concluding at last that she might soon find some man who would marry her and who would make her much happier than she could be by leading a disreputable life with him
molly remained a few moments in silence and then bursting into a flood of tears she began to upbraid him in the following words and this is your love for me to forsake me in this manner now you have ruined me
how often when i have told you that all men are false and perjury alike and grow tired of us as soon as ever they have had their wicked wills of us how often have you sworn you would never forsake me
and can you be such a perjury man after all
what signifies all the riches in the world to me without you now you have gained my heart so you haveyou have
why do you mention another man to me
i can never love any other man as long as i live
all other men are nothing to me
if the greatest squire in all the country would come a suiting to me tomorrow i would not give my company to him
no i shall always hate and despise the whole sex for your sake  she was proceeding thus when an accident put a stop to her tongue before it had run out half its career
the room or rather garret in which molly lay being up one pair of stairs that is to say at the top of the house was of a sloping figure resembling the great delta of the greeks
the english reader may perhaps form a better idea of it by being told that it was impossible to stand upright anywhere but in the middle
now as this room wanted the conveniency of a closet molly had to supply that defect nailed up an old rug against the rafters of the house which enclosed a little hole where her best apparel such as the remains of that sack which we have formerly mentioned some caps and other things with which she had lately provided herself were hung up and secured from the dust
this enclosed place exactly fronted the foot of the bed to which indeed the rug hung so near that it served in a manner to supply the want of curtains
now whether molly in the agonies of her rage pushed this rug with her feet or jones might touch it or whether the pin or nail gave way of its own accord i am not certain but as molly pronounced those last words which are recorded above the wicked rug got loose from its fastening and discovered everything hid behind it where among other female utensils appearedwith shame i write it and with sorrow will it be readthe philosopher square in a posture for the place would not near admit his standing upright as ridiculous as can possibly be conceived
the posture indeed in which he stood was not greatly unlike that of a soldier who is tied neck and heels or rather resembling the attitude in which we often see fellows in the public streets of london who are not suffering but deserving punishment by so standing
he had a nightcap belonging to molly on his head and his two large eyes the moment the rug fell stared directly at jones so that when the idea of philosophy was added to the figure now discovered it would have been very difficult for any spectator to have refrained from immoderate laughter
i question not but the surprize of the reader will be here equal to that of jones as the suspicions which must arise from the appearance of this wise and grave man in such a place may seem so inconsistent with that character which he hath doubtless maintained hitherto in the opinion of every one
but to confess the truth this inconsistency is rather imaginary than real
philosophers are composed of flesh and blood as well as other human creatures and however sublimated and refined the theory of these may be a little practical frailty is as incident to them as to other mortals
it is indeed in theory only and not in practice as we have before hinted that consists the difference for though such great beings think much better and more wisely they always act exactly like other men
they know very well how to subdue all appetites and passions and to despise both pain and pleasure and this knowledge affords much delightful contemplation and is easily acquired but the practice would be vexatious and troublesome and therefore the same wisdom which teaches them to know this teaches them to avoid carrying it into execution
mr square happened to be at church on that sunday when as the reader may be pleased to remember the appearance of molly in her sack had caused all that disturbance
here he first observed her and was so pleased with her beauty that he prevailed with the young gentlemen to change their intended ride that evening that he might pass by the habitation of molly and by that means might obtain a second chance of seeing her
this reason however as he did not at that time mention to any so neither did we think proper to communicate it then to the reader
among other particulars which constituted the unfitness of things in mr square's opinion danger and difficulty were two
the difficulty therefore which he apprehended there might be in corrupting this young wench and the danger which would accrue to his character on the discovery were such strong dissuasives that it is probable he at first intended to have contented himself with the pleasing ideas which the sight of beauty furnishes us with
these the gravest men after a full meal of serious meditation often allow themselves by way of dessert for which purpose certain books and pictures find their way into the most private recesses of their study and a certain liquorish part of natural philosophy is often the principal subject of their conversation
but when the philosopher heard a day or two afterwards that the fortress of virtue had already been subdued he began to give a larger scope to his desires
his appetite was not of that squeamish kind which cannot feed on a dainty because another hath tasted it
in short he liked the girl the better for the want of that chastity which if she had possessed it must have been a bar to his pleasures he pursued and obtained her
the reader will be mistaken if he thinks molly gave square the preference to her younger lover on the contrary had she been confined to the choice of one only tom jones would undoubtedly have been of the two the victorious person
nor was it solely the consideration that two are better than one though this had its proper weight to which mr square owed his success the absence of jones during his confinement was an unlucky circumstance and in that interval some wellchosen presents from the philosopher so softened and unguarded the girl's heart that a favourable opportunity became irresistible and square triumphed over the poor remains of virtue which subsisted in the bosom of molly
it was now about a fortnight since this conquest when jones paid the abovementioned visit to his mistress at a time when she and square were in bed together
this was the true reason why the mother denied her as we have seen for as the old woman shared in the profits arising from the iniquity of her daughter she encouraged and protected her in it to the utmost of her power but such was the envy and hatred which the elder sister bore towards molly that notwithstanding she had some part of the booty she would willingly have parted with this to ruin her sister and spoil her trade
hence she had acquainted jones with her being abovestairs in bed in hopes that he might have caught her in square's arms
this however molly found means to prevent as the door was fastened which gave her an opportunity of conveying her lover behind that rug or blanket where he now was unhappily discovered
square no sooner made his appearance than molly flung herself back in her bed cried out she was undone and abandoned herself to despair
this poor girl who was yet but a novice in her business had not arrived to that perfection of assurance which helps off a town lady in any extremity and either prompts her with an excuse or else inspires her to brazen out the matter with her husband who from love of quiet or out of fear of his reputationand sometimes perhaps from fear of the gallant who like mr constant in the play wears a swordis glad to shut his eyes and content to put his horns in his pocket
molly on the contrary was silenced by this evidence and very fairly gave up a cause which she had hitherto maintained with so many tears and with such solemn and vehement protestations of the purest love and constancy
as to the gentleman behind the arras he was not in much less consternation
he stood for a while motionless and seemed equally at a loss what to say or whither to direct his eyes
jones though perhaps the most astonished of the three first found his tongue and being immediately recovered from those uneasy sensations which molly by her upbraidings had occasioned he burst into a loud laughter and then saluting mr square advanced to take him by the hand and to relieve him from his place of confinement
square being now arrived in the middle of the room in which part only he could stand upright looked at jones with a very grave countenance and said to him well sir i see you enjoy this mighty discovery and i dare swear take great delight in the thoughts of exposing me but if you will consider the matter fairly you will find you are yourself only to blame
i am not guilty of corrupting innocence
i have done nothing for which that part of the world which judges of matters by the rule of right will condemn me
fitness is governed by the nature of things and not by customs forms or municipal laws
nothing is indeed unfit which is not unnaturalwell reasoned old boy answered jones but why dost thou think that i should desire to expose thee
i promise thee i was never better pleased with thee in my life and unless thou hast a mind to discover it thyself this affair may remain a profound secret for menay mr jones replied square i would not be thought to undervalue reputation
good fame is a species of the kalon and it is by no means fitting to neglect it
besides to murder one's own reputation is a kind of suicide a detestable and odious vice
if you think proper therefore to conceal any infirmity of mine for such i may have since no man is perfectly perfect i promise you i will not betray myself
things may be fitting to be done which are not fitting to be boasted of for by the perverse judgment of the world that often becomes the subject of censure which is in truth not only innocent but laudableright cries jones what can be more innocent than the indulgence of a natural appetite
or what more laudable than the propagation of our speciesto be serious with you answered square i profess they always appeared so to meand yet said jones you was of a different opinion when my affair with this girl was first discoveredwhy i must confess says square as the matter was misrepresented to me by that parson thwackum i might condemn the corruption of innocence it was that sir it was thatand that for you must know mr jones in the consideration of fitness very minute circumstances sir very minute circumstances cause great alterationwell cries jones be that as it will it shall be your own fault as i have promised you if you ever hear any more of this adventure
behave kindly to the girl and i will never open my lips concerning the matter to any one
and molly do you be faithful to your friend and i will not only forgive your infidelity to me but will do you all the service i can so saying he took a hasty leave and slipping down the ladder retired with much expedition
square was rejoiced to find this adventure was likely to have no worse conclusion and as for molly being recovered from her confusion she began at first to upbraid square with having been the occasion of her loss of jones but that gentleman soon found the means of mitigating her anger partly by caresses and partly by a small nostrum from his purse of wonderful and approved efficacy in purging off the ill humours of the mind and in restoring it to a good temper
she then poured forth a vast profusion of tenderness towards her new lover turned all she had said to jones and jones himself into ridicule and vowed though he once had the possession of her person that none but square had ever been master of her heart
chapter vi
by comparing which with the former the reader may possibly correct some abuse which he hath formerly been guilty of in the application of the word love
the infidelity of molly which jones had now discovered would perhaps have vindicated a much greater degree of resentment than he expressed on the occasion and if he had abandoned her directly from that moment very few i believe would have blamed him
certain however it is that he saw her in the light of compassion and though his love to her was not of that kind which could give him any great uneasiness at her inconstancy yet was he not a little shocked on reflecting that he had himself originally corrupted her innocence for to this corruption he imputed all the vice into which she appeared now so likely to plunge herself
this consideration gave him no little uneasiness till betty the elder sister was so kind some time afterwards entirely to cure him by a hint that one will barnes and not himself had been the first seducer of molly and that the little child which he had hitherto so certainly concluded to be his own might very probably have an equal title at least to claim barnes for its father
jones eagerly pursued this scent when he had first received it and in a very short time was sufficiently assured that the girl had told him truth not only by the confession of the fellow but at last by that of molly herself
this will barnes was a country gallant and had acquired as many trophies of this kind as any ensign or attorney's clerk in the kingdom
he had indeed reduced several women to a state of utter profligacy had broke the hearts of some and had the honour of occasioning the violent death of one poor girl who had either drowned herself or what was rather more probable had been drowned by him
among other of his conquests this fellow had triumphed over the heart of betty seagrim
he had made love to her long before molly was grown to be a fit object of that pastime but had afterwards deserted her and applied to her sister with whom he had almost immediate success
now will had in reality the sole possession of molly's affection while jones and square were almost equally sacrifices to her interest and to her pride
hence had grown that implacable hatred which we have before seen raging in the mind of betty though we did not think it necessary to assign this cause sooner as envy itself alone was adequate to all the effects we have mentioned
jones was become perfectly easy by possession of this secret with regard to molly but as to sophia he was far from being in a state of tranquillity nay indeed he was under the most violent perturbation his heart was now if i may use the metaphor entirely evacuated and sophia took absolute possession of it
he loved her with an unbounded passion and plainly saw the tender sentiments she had for him yet could not this assurance lessen his despair of obtaining the consent of her father nor the horrors which attended his pursuit of her by any base or treacherous method
the injury which he must thus do to mr western and the concern which would accrue to mr allworthy were circumstances that tormented him all day and haunted him on his pillow at night
his life was a constant struggle between honour and inclination which alternately triumphed over each other in his mind
he often resolved in the absence of sophia to leave her father's house and to see her no more and as often in her presence forgot all those resolutions and determined to pursue her at the hazard of his life and at the forfeiture of what was much dearer to him
this conflict began soon to produce very strong and visible effects for he lost all his usual sprightliness and gaiety of temper and became not only melancholy when alone but dejected and absent in company nay if ever he put on a forced mirth to comply with mr western's humour the constraint appeared so plain that he seemed to have been giving the strongest evidence of what he endeavoured to conceal by such ostentation
it may perhaps be a question whether the art which he used to conceal his passion or the means which honest nature employed to reveal it betrayed him most for while art made him more than ever reserved to sophia and forbad him to address any of his discourse to her nay to avoid meeting her eyes with the utmost caution nature was no less busy in counterplotting him
hence at the approach of the young lady he grew pale and if this was sudden started
if his eyes accidentally met hers the blood rushed into his cheeks and his countenance became all over scarlet
if common civility ever obliged him to speak to her as to drink her health at table his tongue was sure to falter
if he touched her his hand nay his whole frame trembled
and if any discourse tended however remotely to raise the idea of love an involuntary sigh seldom failed to steal from his bosom
most of which accidents nature was wonderfully industrious to throw daily in his way
all these symptoms escaped the notice of the squire but not so of sophia
she soon perceived these agitations of mind in jones and was at no loss to discover the cause for indeed she recognized it in her own breast
and this recognition is i suppose that sympathy which hath been so often noted in lovers and which will sufficiently account for her being so much quickersighted than her father
but to say the truth there is a more simple and plain method of accounting for that prodigious superiority of penetration which we must observe in some men over the rest of the human species and one which will serve not only in the case of lovers but of all others
from whence is it that the knave is generally so quicksighted to those symptoms and operations of knavery which often dupe an honest man of a much better understanding
there surely is no general sympathy among knaves nor have they like freemasons any common sign of communication
in reality it is only because they have the same thing in their heads and their thoughts are turned the same way
thus that sophia saw and that western did not see the plain symptoms of love in jones can be no wonder when we consider that the idea of love never entered into the head of the father whereas the daughter at present thought of nothing else
when sophia was well satisfied of the violent passion which tormented poor jones and no less certain that she herself was its object she had not the least difficulty in discovering the true cause of his present behaviour
this highly endeared him to her and raised in her mind two of the best affections which any lover can wish to raise in a mistressthese were esteem and pityfor sure the most outrageously rigid among her sex will excuse her pitying a man whom she saw miserable on her own account nor can they blame her for esteeming one who visibly from the most honourable motives endeavoured to smother a flame in his own bosom which like the famous spartan theft was preying upon and consuming his very vitals
thus his backwardness his shunning her his coldness and his silence were the forwardest the most diligent the warmest and most eloquent advocates and wrought so violently on her sensible and tender heart that she soon felt for him all those gentle sensations which are consistent with a virtuous and elevated female mind
in short all which esteem gratitude and pity can inspire in such towards an agreeable manindeed all which the nicest delicacy can allow
in a word she was in love with him to distraction
one day this young couple accidentally met in the garden at the end of the two walks which were both bounded by that canal in which jones had formerly risqued drowning to retrieve the little bird that sophia had there lost
this place had been of late much frequented by sophia
here she used to ruminate with a mixture of pain and pleasure on an incident which however trifling in itself had possibly sown the first seeds of that affection which was now arrived to such maturity in her heart
here then this young couple met
they were almost close together before either of them knew anything of the other's approach
a bystander would have discovered sufficient marks of confusion in the countenance of each but they felt too much themselves to make any observation
as soon as jones had a little recovered his first surprize he accosted the young lady with some of the ordinary forms of salutation which she in the same manner returned and their conversation began as usual on the delicious beauty of the morning
hence they past to the beauty of the place on which jones launched forth very high encomiums
when they came to the tree whence he had formerly tumbled into the canal sophia could not help reminding him of that accident and said i fancy mr jones you have some little shuddering when you see that wateri assure you madam answered jones the concern you felt at the loss of your little bird will always appear to me the highest circumstance in that adventure
poor little tommy
there is the branch he stood upon
how could the little wretch have the folly to fly away from that state of happiness in which i had the honour to place him
his fate was a just punishment for his ingratitudeupon my word mr jones said she your gallantry very narrowly escaped as severe a fate
sure the remembrance must affect youindeed madam answered he if i have any reason to reflect with sorrow on it it is perhaps that the water had not been a little deeper by which i might have escaped many bitter heartaches that fortune seems to have in store for mefie mr jones replied sophia i am sure you cannot be in earnest now
this affected contempt of life is only an excess of your complacence to me
you would endeavour to lessen the obligation of having twice ventured it for my sake
beware the third time she spoke these last words with a smile and a softness inexpressible
jones answered with a sigh he feared it was already too late for caution and then looking tenderly and stedfastly on her he cried oh miss western
can you desire me to live
can you wish me so ill sophia looking down on the ground answered with some hesitation indeed mr jones i do not wish you illoh i know too well that heavenly temper  cries jones that divine goodness which is beyond every other charmnay now answered she i understand you not
i can stay no longerii would not be understood cries he nay i can't be understood
i know not what i say
meeting you here so unexpectedly i have been unguarded for heaven's sake pardon me if i have said anything to offend you
i did not mean it
indeed i would rather have diednay the very thought would kill meyou surprize me answered she
how can you possibly think you have offended mefear madam says he easily runs into madness and there is no degree of fear like that which i feel of offending you
how can i speak then
nay don't look angrily at me one frown will destroy me
i mean nothing
blame my eyes or blame those beauties
what am i saying
pardon me if i have said too much
my heart overflowed
i have struggled with my love to the utmost and have endeavoured to conceal a fever which preys on my vitals and will i hope soon make it impossible for me ever to offend you more  mr jones now fell a trembling as if he had been shaken with the fit of an ague
sophia who was in a situation not very different from his answered in these words mr jones i will not affect to misunderstand you indeed i understand you too well but for heaven's sake if you have any affection for me let me make the best of my way into the house
i wish i may be able to support myself thither  jones who was hardly able to support himself offered her his arm which she condescended to accept but begged he would not mention a word more to her of this nature at present
he promised he would not insisting only on her forgiveness of what love without the leave of his will had forced from him this she told him he knew how to obtain by his future behaviour and thus this young pair tottered and trembled along the lover not once daring to squeeze the hand of his mistress though it was locked in his
sophia immediately retired to her chamber where mrs honour and the hartshorn were summoned to her assistance
as to poor jones the only relief to his distempered mind was an unwelcome piece of news which as it opens a scene of different nature from those in which the reader hath lately been conversant will be communicated to him in the next chapter
chapter vii
in which mr allworthy appears on a sickbed
mr western was become so fond of jones that he was unwilling to part with him though his arm had been long since cured and jones either from the love of sport or from some other reason was easily persuaded to continue at his house which he did sometimes for a fortnight together without paying a single visit at mr allworthy's nay without ever hearing from thence
mr allworthy had been for some days indisposed with a cold which had been attended with a little fever
this he had however neglected as it was usual with him to do all manner of disorders which did not confine him to his bed or prevent his several faculties from performing their ordinary functionsa conduct which we would by no means be thought to approve or recommend to imitation for surely the gentlemen of the aesculapian art are in the right in advising that the moment the disease has entered at one door the physician should be introduced at the other what else is meant by that old adage venienti occurrite morbo oppose a distemper at its first approach thus the doctor and the disease meet in fair and equal conflict whereas by giving time to the latter we often suffer him to fortify and entrench himself like a french army so that the learned gentleman finds it very difficult and sometimes impossible to come at the enemy
nay sometimes by gaining time the disease applies to the french military politics and corrupts nature over to his side and then all the powers of physic must arrive too late
agreeable to these observations was i remember the complaint of the great doctor misaubin who used very pathetically to lament the late applications which were made to his skill saying bygar me believe my pation take me for de undertaker for dey never send for me till de physicion have kill dem  mr allworthy's distemper by means of this neglect gained such ground that when the increase of his fever obliged him to send for assistance the doctor at his first arrival shook his head wished he had been sent for sooner and intimated that he thought him in very imminent danger
mr allworthy who had settled all his affairs in this world and was as well prepared as it is possible for human nature to be for the other received this information with the utmost calmness and unconcern
he could indeed whenever he laid himself down to rest say with cato in the tragical poem                                 let guilt or fear      disturb man's rest cato knows neither of them      indifferent in his choice to sleep or die
in reality he could say this with ten times more reason and confidence than cato or any other proud fellow among the antient or modern heroes for he was not only devoid of fear but might be considered as a faithful labourer when at the end of harvest he is summoned to receive his reward at the hands of a bountiful master
the good man gave immediate orders for all his family to be summoned round him
none of these were then abroad but mrs blifil who had been some time in london and mr jones whom the reader hath just parted from at mr western's and who received this summons just as sophia had left him
the news of mr allworthy's danger for the servant told him he was dying drove all thoughts of love out of his head
he hurried instantly into the chariot which was sent for him and ordered the coachman to drive with all imaginable haste nor did the idea of sophia i believe once occur to him on the way
and now the whole family namely mr blifil mr jones mr thwackum mr square and some of the servants for such were mr allworthy's orders being all assembled round his bed the good man sat up in it and was beginning to speak when blifil fell to blubbering and began to express very loud and bitter lamentations
upon this mr allworthy shook him by the hand and said do not sorrow thus my dear nephew at the most ordinary of all human occurrences
when misfortunes befal our friends we are justly grieved for those are accidents which might often have been avoided and which may seem to render the lot of one man more peculiarly unhappy than that of others but death is certainly unavoidable and is that common lot in which alone the fortunes of all men agree nor is the time when this happens to us very material
if the wisest of men hath compared life to a span surely we may be allowed to consider it as a day
it is my fate to leave it in the evening but those who are taken away earlier have only lost a few hours at the best little worth lamenting and much oftener hours of labour and fatigue of pain and sorrow
one of the roman poets i remember likens our leaving life to our departure from a feasta thought which hath often occurred to me when i have seen men struggling to protract an entertainment and to enjoy the company of their friends a few moments longer
alas
how short is the most protracted of such enjoyments
how immaterial the difference between him who retires the soonest and him who stays the latest
this is seeing life in the best view and this unwillingness to quit our friends is the most amiable motive from which we can derive the fear of death and yet the longest enjoyment which we can hope for of this kind is of so trivial a duration that it is to a wise man truly contemptible
few men i own think in this manner for indeed few men think of death till they are in its jaws
however gigantic and terrible an object this may appear when it approaches them they are nevertheless incapable of seeing it at any distance nay though they have been ever so much alarmed and frightened when they have apprehended themselves in danger of dying they are no sooner cleared from this apprehension than even the fears of it are erased from their minds
but alas
he who escapes from death is not pardoned he is only reprieved and reprieved to a short day
grieve therefore no more my dear child on this occasion an event which may happen every hour which every element nay almost every particle of matter that surrounds us is capable of producing and which must and will most unavoidably reach us all at last ought neither to occasion our surprize nor our lamentation
my physician having acquainted me which i take very kindly of him that i am in danger of leaving you all very shortly i have determined to say a few words to you at this our parting before my distemper which i find grows very fast upon me puts it out of my power
but i shall waste my strength too much
i intended to speak concerning my will which though i have settled long ago i think proper to mention such heads of it as concern any of you that i may have the comfort of perceiving you are all satisfied with the provision i have there made for you
nephew blifil i leave you the heir to my whole estate except only  ayear which is to revert to you after the death of your mother and except one other estate of  ayear and the sum of  which i have bestowed in the following manner  the estate of  ayear i have given to you mr jones and as i know the inconvenience which attends the want of ready money i have added  in specie
in this i know not whether i have exceeded or fallen short of your expectation
perhaps you will think i have given you too little and the world will be as ready to condemn me for giving you too much but the latter censure i despise and as to the former unless you should entertain that common error which i have often heard in my life pleaded as an excuse for a total want of charity namely that instead of raising gratitude by voluntary acts of bounty we are apt to raise demands which of all others are the most boundless and most difficult to satisfypardon me the bare mention of this i will not suspect any such thing  jones flung himself at his benefactor's feet and taking eagerly hold of his hand assured him his goodness to him both now and all other times had so infinitely exceeded not only his merit but his hopes that no words could express his sense of it
and i assure you sir  said he your present generosity hath left me no other concern than for the present melancholy occasion
oh my friend my father here his words choaked him and he turned away to hide a tear which was starting from his eyes
allworthy then gently squeezed his hand and proceeded thus i am convinced my child that you have much goodness generosity and honour in your temper if you will add prudence and religion to these you must be happy for the three former qualities i admit make you worthy of happiness but they are the latter only which will put you in possession of it
one thousand pound i have given to you mr thwackum a sum i am convinced which greatly exceeds your desires as well as your wants
however you will receive it as a memorial of my friendship and whatever superfluities may redound to you that piety which you so rigidly maintain will instruct you how to dispose of them
a like sum mr square i have bequeathed to you
this i hope will enable you to pursue your profession with better success than hitherto
i have often observed with concern that distress is more apt to excite contempt than commiseration especially among men of business with whom poverty is understood to indicate want of ability
but the little i have been able to leave you will extricate you from those difficulties with which you have formerly struggled and then i doubt not but you will meet with sufficient prosperity to supply what a man of your philosophical temper will require
i find myself growing faint so i shall refer you to my will for my disposition of the residue
my servants will there find some tokens to remember me by and there are a few charities which i trust my executors will see faithfully performed
bless you all
i am setting out a little before you  here a footman came hastily into the room and said there was an attorney from salisbury who had a particular message which he said he must communicate to mr allworthy himself that he seemed in a violent hurry and protested he had so much business to do that if he could cut himself into four quarters all would not be sufficient
go child said allworthy to blifil see what the gentleman wants
i am not able to do any business now nor can he have any with me in which you are not at present more concerned than myself
besides i really ami am incapable of seeing any one at present or of any longer attention he then saluted them all saying perhaps he should be able to see them again but he should be now glad to compose himself a little finding that he had too much exhausted his spirits in discourse
some of the company shed tears at their parting and even the philosopher square wiped his eyes albeit unused to the melting mood
as to mrs wilkins she dropt her pearls as fast as the arabian trees their medicinal gums for this was a ceremonial which that gentlewoman never omitted on a proper occasion
after this mr allworthy again laid himself down on his pillow and endeavoured to compose himself to rest
chapter viii
containing matter rather natural than pleasing
besides grief for her master there was another source for that briny stream which so plentifully rose above the two mountainous cheekbones of the housekeeper
she was no sooner retired than she began to mutter to herself in the following pleasant strain sure master might have made some difference methinks between me and the other servants
i suppose he hath left me mourning but i'fackins
if that be all the devil shall wear it for him for me
i'd have his worship know i am no beggar
i have saved five hundred pound in his service and after all to be used in this mannerit is a fine encouragement to servants to be honest and to be sure if i have taken a little something now and then others have taken ten times as much and now we are all put in a lump together
if so be that it be so the legacy may go to the devil with him that gave it
no i won't give it up neither because that will please some folks
no i'll buy the gayest gown i can get and dance over the old curmudgeon's grave in it
this is my reward for taking his part so often when all the country have cried shame of him for breeding up his bastard in that manner but he is going now where he must pay for all
it would have become him better to have repented of his sins on his deathbed than to glory in them and give away his estate out of his own family to a misbegotten child
found in his bed forsooth
a pretty story
ay ay those that hide know where to find
lord forgive him
i warrant he hath many more bastards to answer for if the truth was known
one comfort is they will all be known where he is a going nowthe servants will find some token to remember me by'
those were the very words i shall never forget them if i was to live a thousand years
ay ay i shall remember you for huddling me among the servants
one would have thought he might have mentioned my name as well as that of square but he is a gentleman forsooth though he had not cloths on his back when he came hither first
marry come up with such gentlemen
though he hath lived here this many years i don't believe there is arrow a servant in the house ever saw the colour of his money
the devil shall wait upon such a gentleman for me much more of the like kind she muttered to herself but this taste shall suffice to the reader
neither thwackum nor square were much better satisfied with their legacies
though they breathed not their resentment so loud yet from the discontent which appeared in their countenances as well as from the following dialogue we collect that no great pleasure reigned in their minds
about an hour after they had left the sickroom square met thwackum in the hall and accosted him thus well sir have you heard any news of your friend since we parted from himif you mean mr allworthy  answered thwackum i think you might rather give him the appellation of your friend for he seems to me to have deserved that titlethe title is as good on your side replied square for his bounty such as it is hath been equal to bothi should not have mentioned it first cries thwackum but since you begin i must inform you i am of a different opinion
there is a wide distinction between voluntary favours and rewards
the duty i have done in his family and the care i have taken in the education of his two boys are services for which some men might have expected a greater return
i would not have you imagine i am therefore dissatisfied for st paul hath taught me to be content with the little i have
had the modicum been less i should have known my duty
but though the scriptures obliges me to remain contented it doth not enjoin me to shut my eyes to my own merit nor restrain me from seeing when i am injured by an unjust comparisonsince you provoke me returned square that injury is done to me nor did i ever imagine mr allworthy had held my friendship so light as to put me in balance with one who received his wages
i know to what it is owing it proceeds from those narrow principles which you have been so long endeavouring to infuse into him in contempt of everything which is great and noble
the beauty and loveliness of friendship is too strong for dim eyes nor can it be perceived by any other medium than that unerring rule of right which you have so often endeavoured to ridicule that you have perverted your friend's understandingi wish cries thwackum in a rage i wish for the sake of his soul your damnable doctrines have not perverted his faith
it is to this i impute his present behaviour so unbecoming a christian
who but an atheist could think of leaving the world without having first made up his account
without confessing his sins and receiving that absolution which he knew he had one in the house duly authorized to give him
he will feel the want of these necessaries when it is too late when he is arrived at that place where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth
it is then he will find in what mighty stead that heathen goddess that virtue which you and all other deists of the age adore will stand him
he will then summon his priest when there is none to be found and will lament the want of that absolution without which no sinner can be safeif it be so material says square why don't you present it him of your own accord it hath no virtue cries thwackum but to those who have sufficient grace to require it
but why do i talk thus to a heathen and an unbeliever
it is you that taught him this lesson for which you have been well rewarded in this world as i doubt not your disciple will soon be in the otheri know not what you mean by reward said square but if you hint at that pitiful memorial of our friendship which he hath thought fit to bequeath me i despise it and nothing but the unfortunate situation of my circumstances should prevail on me to accept it  the physician now arrived and began to inquire of the two disputants how we all did abovestairs
in a miserable way answered thwackum
it is no more than i expected cries the doctor but pray what symptoms have appeared since i left youno good ones i am afraid replied thwackum after what past at our departure i think there were little hopes the bodily physician perhaps misunderstood the curer of souls and before they came to an explanation mr blifil came to them with a most melancholy countenance and acquainted them that he brought sad news that his mother was dead at salisbury that she had been seized on the road home with the gout in her head and stomach which had carried her off in a few hours
goodlackaday  says the doctor
one cannot answer for events but i wish i had been at hand to have been called in
the gout is a distemper which it is difficult to treat yet i have been remarkably successful in it  thwackum and square both condoled with mr blifil for the loss of his mother which the one advised him to bear like a man and the other like a christian
the young gentleman said he knew very well we were all mortal and he would endeavour to submit to his loss as well as he could
that he could not however help complaining a little against the peculiar severity of his fate which brought the news of so great a calamity to him by surprize and that at a time when he hourly expected the severest blow he was capable of feeling from the malice of fortune
he said the present occasion would put to the test those excellent rudiments which he had learnt from mr thwackum and mr square and it would be entirely owing to them if he was enabled to survive such misfortunes
it was now debated whether mr allworthy should be informed of the death of his sister
this the doctor violently opposed in which i believe the whole college would agree with him but mr blifil said he had received such positive and repeated orders from his uncle never to keep any secret from him for fear of the disquietude which it might give him that he durst not think of disobedience whatever might be the consequence
he said for his part considering the religious and philosophic temper of his uncle he could not agree with the doctor in his apprehensions
he was therefore resolved to communicate it to him for if his uncle recovered as he heartily prayed he might he knew he would never forgive an endeavour to keep a secret of this kind from him
the physician was forced to submit to these resolutions which the two other learned gentlemen very highly commended
so together moved mr blifil and the doctor toward the sickroom where the physician first entered and approached the bed in order to feel his patient's pulse which he had no sooner done than he declared he was much better that the last application had succeeded to a miracle and had brought the fever to intermit so that he said there appeared now to be as little danger as he had before apprehended there were hopes
to say the truth mr allworthy's situation had never been so bad as the great caution of the doctor had represented it but as a wise general never despises his enemy however inferior that enemy's force may be so neither doth a wise physician ever despise a distemper however inconsiderable
as the former preserves the same strict discipline places the same guards and employs the same scouts though the enemy be never so weak so the latter maintains the same gravity of countenance and shakes his head with the same significant air let the distemper be never so trifling
and both among many other good ones may assign this solid reason for their conduct that by these means the greater glory redounds to them if they gain the victory and the less disgrace if by any unlucky accident they should happen to be conquered
mr allworthy had no sooner lifted up his eyes and thanked heaven for these hopes of his recovery than mr blifil drew near with a very dejected aspect and having applied his handkerchief to his eye either to wipe away his tears or to do as ovid somewhere expresses himself on another occasion       si nullus erit tamen excute nullum       if there be none then wipe away that none  he communicated to his uncle what the reader hath been just before acquainted with
allworthy received the news with concern with patience and with resignation
he dropt a tender tear then composed his countenance and at last cried the lord's will be done in everything  he now enquired for the messenger but blifil told him it had been impossible to detain him a moment for he appeared by the great hurry he was in to have some business of importance on his hands that he complained of being hurried and driven and torn out of his life and repeated many times that if he could divide himself into four quarters he knew how to dispose of every one
allworthy then desired blifil to take care of the funeral
he said he would have his sister deposited in his own chapel and as to the particulars he left them to his own discretion only mentioning the person whom he would have employed on this occasion
chapter ix
which among other things may serve as a comment on that saying of aeschines that drunkenness shows the mind of a man as a mirrour reflects his person   the reader may perhaps wonder at hearing nothing of mr jones in the last chapter
in fact his behaviour was so different from that of the persons there mentioned that we chose not to confound his name with theirs
when the good man had ended his speech jones was the last who deserted the room
thence he retired to his own apartment to give vent to his concern but the restlessness of his mind would not suffer him to remain long there he slipped softly therefore to allworthy's chamberdoor where he listened a considerable time without hearing any kind of motion within unless a violent snoring which at last his fears misrepresented as groans
this so alarmed him that he could not forbear entering the room where he found the good man in the bed in a sweet composed sleep and his nurse snoring in the above mentioned hearty manner at the bed's feet
he immediately took the only method of silencing this thorough bass whose music he feared might disturb mr allworthy and then sitting down by the nurse he remained motionless till blifil and the doctor came in together and waked the sick man in order that the doctor might feel his pulse and that the other might communicate to him that piece of news which had jones been apprized of it would have had great difficulty of finding its way to mr allworthy's ear at such a season
when he first heard blifil tell his uncle this story jones could hardly contain the wrath which kindled in him at the other's indiscretion especially as the doctor shook his head and declared his unwillingness to have the matter mentioned to his patient
but as his passion did not so far deprive him of all use of his understanding as to hide from him the consequences which any violent expression towards blifil might have on the sick this apprehension stilled his rage at the present and he grew afterwards so satisfied with finding that this news had in fact produced no mischief that he suffered his anger to die in his own bosom without ever mentioning it to blifil
the physician dined that day at mr allworthy's and having after dinner visited his patient he returned to the company and told them that he had now the satisfaction to say with assurance that his patient was out of all danger that he had brought his fever to a perfect intermission and doubted not by throwing in the bark to prevent its return
this account so pleased jones and threw him into such immoderate excess of rapture that he might be truly said to be drunk with joyan intoxication which greatly forwards the effects of wine and as he was very free too with the bottle on this occasion for he drank many bumpers to the doctor's health as well as to other toasts he became very soon literally drunk
jones had naturally violent animal spirits these being set on float and augmented by the spirit of wine produced most extravagant effects
he kissed the doctor and embraced him with the most passionate endearments swearing that next to mr allworthy himself he loved him of all men living
doctor added he you deserve a statue to be erected to you at the public expense for having preserved a man who is not only the darling of all good men who know him but a blessing to society the glory of his country and an honour to human nature
dn me if i don't love him better than my own soul  more shame for you cries thwackum
though i think you have reason to love him for he hath provided very well for you
and perhaps it might have been better for some folks that he had not lived to see just reason of revoking his gift  jones now looking on thwackum with inconceivable disdain answered and doth thy mean soul imagine that any such considerations could weigh with me
no let the earth open and swallow her own dirt if i had millions of acres i would say it rather than swallow up my dear glorious friend       quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus      tam chari capitis     what modesty or measure can set bounds to our desire of so dear   a friend the word desiderium here cannot be easily translated
it includes our desire of enjoying our friend again and the grief   which attends that desire
the doctor now interposed and prevented the effects of a wrath which was kindling between jones and thwackum after which the former gave a loose to mirth sang two or three amorous songs and fell into every frantic disorder which unbridled joy is apt to inspire but so far was he from any disposition to quarrel that he was ten times better humoured if possible than when he was sober
to say truth nothing is more erroneous than the common observation that men who are illnatured and quarrelsome when they are drunk are very worthy persons when they are sober for drink in reality doth not reverse nature or create passions in men which did not exist in them before
it takes away the guard of reason and consequently forces us to produce those symptoms which many when sober have art enough to conceal
it heightens and inflames our passions generally indeed that passion which is uppermost in our mind so that the angry temper the amorous the generous the goodhumoured the avaricious and all other dispositions of men are in their cups heightened and exposed
and yet as no nation produces so many drunken quarrels especially among the lower people as england for indeed with them to drink and to fight together are almost synonymous terms i would not methinks have it thence concluded that the english are the worstnatured people alive
perhaps the love of glory only is at the bottom of this so that the fair conclusion seems to be that our countrymen have more of that love and more of bravery than any other plebeians
and this the rather as there is seldom anything ungenerous unfair or illnatured exercised on these occasions nay it is common for the combatants to express goodwill for each other even at the time of the conflict and as their drunken mirth generally ends in a battle so do most of their battles end in friendship
but to return to our history
though jones had shown no design of giving offence yet mr blifil was highly offended at a behaviour which was so inconsistent with the sober and prudent reserve of his own temper
he bore it too with the greater impatience as it appeared to him very indecent at this season when as he said the house was a house of mourning on the account of his dear mother and if it had pleased heaven to give him some prospect of mr allworthy's recovery it would become them better to express the exultations of their hearts in thanksgiving than in drunkenness and riots which were properer methods to encrease the divine wrath than to avert it thwackum who had swallowed more liquor than jones but without any ill effect on his brain seconded the pious harangue of blifil but square for reasons which the reader may probably guess was totally silent
wine had not so totally overpowered jones as to prevent his recollecting mr blifil's loss the moment it was mentioned
as no person therefore was more ready to confess and condemn his own errors he offered to shake mr blifil by the hand and begged his pardon saying his excessive joy for mr allworthy's recovery had driven every other thought out of his mind  blifil scornfully rejected his hand and with much indignation answered it was little to be wondered at if tragical spectacles made no impression on the blind but for his part he had the misfortune to know who his parents were and consequently must be affected with their loss  jones who notwithstanding his good humour had some mixture of the irascible in his constitution leaped hastily from his chair and catching hold of blifil's collar cried out dn you for a rascal do you insult me with the misfortune of my birth he accompanied these words with such rough actions that they soon got the better of mr blifil's peaceful temper and a scuffle immediately ensued which might have produced mischief had it not been prevented by the interposition of thwackum and the physician for the philosophy of square rendered him superior to all emotions and he very calmly smoaked his pipe as was his custom in all broils unless when he apprehended some danger of having it broke in his mouth
the combatants being now prevented from executing present vengeance on each other betook themselves to the common resources of disappointed rage and vented their wrath in threats and defiance
in this kind of conflict fortune which in the personal attack seemed to incline to jones was now altogether as favourable to his enemy
a truce nevertheless was at length agreed on by the mediation of the neutral parties and the whole company again sat down at the table where jones being prevailed on to ask pardon and blifil to give it peace was restored and everything seemed in statu quo
but though the quarrel was in all appearance perfectly reconciled the good humour which had been interrupted by it was by no means restored
all merriment was now at an end and the subsequent discourse consisted only of grave relations of matters of fact and of as grave observations upon them a species of conversation in which though there is much of dignity and instruction there is but little entertainment
as we presume therefore to convey only this last to the reader we shall pass by whatever was said till the rest of the company having by degrees dropped off left only square and the physician together at which time the conversation was a little heightened by some comments on what had happened between the two young gentlemen both of whom the doctor declared to be no better than scoundrels to which appellation the philosopher very sagaciously shaking his head agreed
chapter x
showing the truth of many observations of ovid and of other more grave writers who have proved beyond contradiction that wine is often the forerunner of incontinency
jones retired from the company in which we have seen him engaged into the fields where he intended to cool himself by a walk in the open air before he attended mr allworthy
there whilst he renewed those meditations on his dear sophia which the dangerous illness of his friend and benefactor had for some time interrupted an accident happened which with sorrow we relate and with sorrow doubtless will it be read however that historic truth to which we profess so inviolable an attachment obliges us to communicate it to posterity
it was now a pleasant evening in the latter end of june when our heroe was walking in a most delicious grove where the gentle breezes fanning the leaves together with the sweet trilling of a murmuring stream and the melodious notes of nightingales formed altogether the most enchanting harmony
in this scene so sweetly accommodated to love he meditated on his dear sophia
while his wanton fancy roamed unbounded over all her beauties and his lively imagination painted the charming maid in various ravishing forms his warm heart melted with tenderness and at length throwing himself on the ground by the side of a gently murmuring brook he broke forth into the following ejaculation  o sophia would heaven give thee to my arms how blest would be my condition
curst be that fortune which sets a distance between us
was i but possessed of thee one only suit of rags thy whole estate is there a man on earth whom i would envy
how contemptible would the brightest circassian beauty drest in all the jewels of the indies appear to my eyes
but why do i mention another woman
could i think my eyes capable of looking at any other with tenderness these hands should tear them from my head
no my sophia if cruel fortune separates us for ever my soul shall doat on thee alone
the chastest constancy will i ever preserve to thy image
though i should never have possession of thy charming person still shalt thou alone have possession of my thoughts my love my soul
oh
my fond heart is so wrapt in that tender bosom that the brightest beauties would for me have no charms nor would a hermit be colder in their embraces
sophia sophia alone shall be mine
what raptures are in that name
i will engrave it on every tree  at these words he started up and beheldnot his sophiano nor a circassian maid richly and elegantly attired for the grand signior's seraglio
no without a gown in a shift that was somewhat of the coarsest and none of the cleanest bedewed likewise with some odoriferous effluvia the produce of the day's labour with a pitchfork in her hand molly seagrim approached
our hero had his penknife in his hand which he had drawn for the beforementioned purpose of carving on the bark when the girl coming near him cryed out with a smile you don't intend to kill me squire i hopewhy should you think i would kill you answered jones
nay replied she after your cruel usage of me when i saw you last killing me would perhaps be too great kindness for me to expect  here ensued a parley which as i do not think myself obliged to relate it i shall omit
it is sufficient that it lasted a full quarter of an hour at the conclusion of which they retired into the thickest part of the grove
some of my readers may be inclined to think this event unnatural
however the fact is true and perhaps may be sufficiently accounted for by suggesting that jones probably thought one woman better than none and molly as probably imagined two men to be better than one
besides the beforementioned motive assigned to the present behaviour of jones the reader will be likewise pleased to recollect in his favour that he was not at this time perfect master of that wonderful power of reason which so well enables grave and wise men to subdue their unruly passions and to decline any of these prohibited amusements
wine now had totally subdued this power in jones
he was indeed in a condition in which if reason had interposed though only to advise she might have received the answer which one cleostratus gave many years ago to a silly fellow who asked him if he was not ashamed to be drunk
are not you said cleostratus ashamed to admonish a drunken manto say the truth in a court of justice drunkenness must not be an excuse yet in a court of conscience it is greatly so and therefore aristotle who commends the laws of pittacus by which drunken men received double punishment for their crimes allows there is more of policy than justice in that law
now if there are any transgressions pardonable from drunkenness they are certainly such as mr jones was at present guilty of on which head i could pour forth a vast profusion of learning if i imagined it would either entertain my reader or teach him anything more than he knows already
for his sake therefore i shall keep my learning to myself and return to my history
it hath been observed that fortune seldom doth things by halves
to say truth there is no end to her freaks whenever she is disposed to gratify or displease
no sooner had our heroe retired with his dido but       speluncam blifil dux et divinus eandem      deveniunt  the parson and the young squire who were taking a serious walk arrived at the stile which leads into the grove and the latter caught a view of the lovers just as they were sinking out of sight
blifil knew jones very well though he was at above a hundred yards' distance and he was as positive to the sex of his companion though not to the individual person
he started blessed himself and uttered a very solemn ejaculation
thwackum expressed some surprize at these sudden emotions and asked the reason of them
to which blifil answered he was certain he had seen a fellow and wench retire together among the bushes which he doubted not was with some wicked purpose as to the name of jones he thought proper to conceal it and why he did so must be left to the judgment of the sagacious reader for we never chuse to assign motives to the actions of men when there is any possibility of our being mistaken
the parson who was not only strictly chaste in his own person but a great enemy to the opposite vice in all others fired at this information
he desired mr blifil to conduct him immediately to the place which as he approached he breathed forth vengeance mixed with lamentations nor did he refrain from casting some oblique reflections on mr allworthy insinuating that the wickedness of the country was principally owing to the encouragement he had given to vice by having exerted such kindness to a bastard and by having mitigated that just and wholesome rigour of the law which allots a very severe punishment to loose wenches
the way through which our hunters were to pass in pursuit of their game was so beset with briars that it greatly obstructed their walk and caused besides such a rustling that jones had sufficient warning of their arrival before they could surprize him nay indeed so incapable was thwackum of concealing his indignation and such vengeance did he mutter forth every step he took that this alone must have abundantly satisfied jones that he was to use the language of sportsmen found sitting
chapter xi
in which a simile in mr pope's period of a mile introduces as bloody a battle as can possibly be fought without the assistance of steel or cold iron
as in the season of rutting an uncouth phrase by which the vulgar denote that gentle dalliance which in the wellwooded forest of hampshire passes between lovers of the ferine kind if while the loftycrested stag meditates the amorous sport a couple of puppies or any other beasts of hostile note should wander so near the temple of venus ferina that the fair hind should shrink from the place touched with that somewhat either of fear or frolic of nicety or skittishness with which nature hath bedecked all females or hath at least instructed them how to put it on lest through the indelicacy of males the samean mysteries should be pryed into by unhallowed eyes for at the celebration of these rites the female priestess cries out with her in virgil who was then probably hard at work on such celebration        procul o procul este profani       proclamat vates totoque absistite luco        far hence be souls profane       the sibyl cry'd and from the grove abstaindryden
 this is an ambiguous phrase and may mean either a forest well   cloathed with wood or well stript of it
if i say while these sacred rites which are in common to genus omne animantium are in agitation between the stag and his mistress any hostile beasts should venture too near on the first hint given by the frighted hind fierce and tremendous rushes forth the stag to the entrance of the thicket there stands he centinel over his love stamps the ground with his foot and with his horns brandished aloft in air proudly provokes the apprehended foe to combat
thus and more terrible when he perceived the enemy's approach leaped forth our heroe
many a step advanced he forwards in order to conceal the trembling hind and if possible to secure her retreat
and now thwackum having first darted some livid lightning from his fiery eyes began to thunder forth fie upon it
fie upon it
mr jones
is it possible you should be the personyou see answered jones it is possible i should be hereand who said thwackum is that wicked slut with youif i have any wicked slut with me  cries jones it is possible i shall not let you know who she isi command you to tell me immediately says thwackum and i would not have you imagine young man that your age though it hath somewhat abridged the purpose of tuition hath totally taken away the authority of the master
the relation of the master and scholar is indelible as indeed all other relations are for they all derive their original from heaven
i would have you think yourself therefore as much obliged to obey me now as when i taught you your first rudimentsi believe you would cries jones but that will not happen unless you had the same birchen argument to convince methen i must tell you plainly said thwackum i am resolved to discover the wicked wretchand i must tell you plainly returned jones i am resolved you shall not thwackum then offered to advance and jones laid hold of his arms which mr blifil endeavoured to rescue declaring he would not see his old master insulted  jones now finding himself engaged with two thought it necessary to rid himself of one of his antagonists as soon as possible
he therefore applied to the weakest first and letting the parson go he directed a blow at the young squire's breast which luckily taking place reduced him to measure his length on the ground
thwackum was so intent on the discovery that the moment he found himself at liberty he stept forward directly into the fern without any great consideration of what might in the meantime befal his friend but he had advanced a very few paces into the thicket before jones having defeated blifil overtook the parson and dragged him backward by the skirt of his coat
this parson had been a champion in his youth and had won much honour by his fist both at school and at the university
he had now indeed for a great number of years declined the practice of that noble art yet was his courage full as strong as his faith and his body no less strong than either
he was moreover as the reader may perhaps have conceived somewhat irascible in his nature
when he looked back therefore and saw his friend stretched out on the ground and found himself at the same time so roughly handled by one who had formerly been only passive in all conflicts between them a circumstance which highly aggravated the whole his patience at length gave way he threw himself into a posture of offence and collecting all his force attacked jones in the front with as much impetuosity as he had formerly attacked him in the rear
our heroe received the enemy's attack with the most undaunted intrepidity and his bosom resounded with the blow
this he presently returned with no less violence aiming likewise at the parson's breast but he dexterously drove down the fist of jones so that it reached only his belly where two pounds of beef and as many of pudding were then deposited and whence consequently no hollow sound could proceed
many lusty blows much more pleasant as well as easy to have seen than to read or describe were given on both sides at last a violent fall in which jones had thrown his knees into thwackum's breast so weakened the latter that victory had been no longer dubious had not blifil who had now recovered his strength again renewed the fight and by engaging with jones given the parson a moment's time to shake his ears and to regain his breath
and now both together attacked our heroe whose blows did not retain that force with which they had fallen at first so weakened was he by his combat with thwackum for though the pedagogue chose rather to play solos on the human instrument and had been lately used to those only yet he still retained enough of his antient knowledge to perform his part very well in a duet
the victory according to modern custom was like to be decided by numbers when on a sudden a fourth pair of fists appeared in the battle and immediately paid their compliments to the parson and the owner of them at the same time crying out are not you ashamed and be dn'd to you to fall two of you upon one  the battle which was of the kind that for distinction's sake is called royal now raged with the utmost violence during a few minutes till blifil being a second time laid sprawling by jones thwackum condescended to apply for quarter to his new antagonist who was now found to be mr western himself for in the heat of the action none of the combatants had recognized him
in fact that honest squire happening in his afternoon's walk with some company to pass through the field where the bloody battle was fought and having concluded from seeing three men engaged that two of them must be on a side he hastened from his companions and with more gallantry than policy espoused the cause of the weaker party
by which generous proceeding he very probably prevented mr jones from becoming a victim to the wrath of thwackum and to the pious friendship which blifil bore his old master for besides the disadvantage of such odds jones had not yet sufficiently recovered the former strength of his broken arm
this reinforcement however soon put an end to the action and jones with his ally obtained the victory
chapter xii
in which is seen a more moving spectacle than all the blood in the bodies of thwackum and blifil and of twenty other such is capable of producing
the rest of mr western's company were now come up being just at the instant when the action was over
these were the honest clergyman whom we have formerly seen at mr western's table mrs western the aunt of sophia and lastly the lovely sophia herself
at this time the following was the aspect of the bloody field
in one place lay on the ground all pale and almost breathless the vanquished blifil
near him stood the conqueror jones almost covered with blood part of which was naturally his own and part had been lately the property of the reverend mr thwackum
in a third place stood the said thwackum like king porus sullenly submitting to the conqueror
the last figure in the piece was western the great most gloriously forbearing the vanquished foe
blifil in whom there was little sign of life was at first the principal object of the concern of every one and particularly of mrs western who had drawn from her pocket a bottle of hartshorn and was herself about to apply it to his nostrils when on a sudden the attention of the whole company was diverted from poor blifil whose spirit if it had any such design might have now taken an opportunity of stealing off to the other world without any ceremony
for now a more melancholy and a more lovely object lay motionless before them
this was no other than the charming sophia herself who from the sight of blood or from fear for her father or from some other reason had fallen down in a swoon before any one could get to her assistance
mrs western first saw her and screamed
immediately two or three voices cried out miss western is dead hartshorn water every remedy was called for almost at one and the same instant
the reader may remember that in our description of this grove we mentioned a murmuring brook which brook did not come there as such gentle streams flow through vulgar romances with no other purpose than to murmur
no
fortune had decreed to ennoble this little brook with a higher honour than any of those which wash the plains of arcadia ever deserved
jones was rubbing blifil's temples for he began to fear he had given him a blow too much when the words miss western and dead rushed at once on his ear
he started up left blifil to his fate and flew to sophia whom while all the rest were running against each other backward and forward looking for water in the dry paths he caught up in his arms and then ran away with her over the field to the rivulet above mentioned where plunging himself into the water he contrived to besprinkle her face head and neck very plentifully
happy was it for sophia that the same confusion which prevented her other friends from serving her prevented them likewise from obstructing jones
he had carried her half ways before they knew what he was doing and he had actually restored her to life before they reached the waterside
she stretched out her arms opened her eyes and cried oh
heavens just as her father aunt and the parson came up
jones who had hitherto held this lovely burthen in his arms now relinquished his hold but gave her at the same instant a tender caress which had her senses been then perfectly restored could not have escaped her observation
as she expressed therefore no displeasure at this freedom we suppose she was not sufficiently recovered from her swoon at the time
this tragical scene was now converted into a sudden scene of joy
in this our heroe was certainly the principal character for as he probably felt more ecstatic delight in having saved sophia than she herself received from being saved so neither were the congratulations paid to her equal to what were conferred on jones especially by mr western himself who after having once or twice embraced his daughter fell to hugging and kissing jones
he called him the preserver of sophia and declared there was nothing except her or his estate which he would not give him but upon recollection he afterwards excepted his foxhounds the chevalier and miss slouch for so he called his favourite mare
all fears for sophia being now removed jones became the object of the squire's considerationcome my lad says western d'off thy quoat and wash thy feace for att in a devilish pickle i promise thee
come come wash thyself and shat go huome with me and we'l zee to vind thee another quoat  jones immediately complied threw off his coat went down to the water and washed both his face and bosom for the latter was as much exposed and as bloody as the former
but though the water could clear off the blood it could not remove the black and blue marks which thwackum had imprinted on both his face and breast and which being discerned by sophia drew from her a sigh and a look full of inexpressible tenderness
jones received this full in his eyes and it had infinitely a stronger effect on him than all the contusions which he had received before
an effect however widely different for so soft and balmy was it that had all his former blows been stabs it would for some minutes have prevented his feeling their smart
the company now moved backwards and soon arrived where thwackum had got mr blifil again on his legs
here we cannot suppress a pious wish that all quarrels were to be decided by those weapons only with which nature knowing what is proper for us hath supplied us and that cold iron was to be used in digging no bowels but those of the earth
then would war the pastime of monarchs be almost inoffensive and battles between great armies might be fought at the particular desire of several ladies of quality who together with the kings themselves might be actual spectators of the conflict
then might the field be this moment well strewed with human carcasses and the next the dead men or infinitely the greatest part of them might get up like mr bayes's troops and march off either at the sound of a drum or fiddle as should be previously agreed on
i would avoid if possible treating this matter ludicrously lest grave men and politicians whom i know to be offended at a jest may cry pish at it but in reality might not a battle be as well decided by the greater number of broken heads bloody noses and black eyes as by the greater heaps of mangled and murdered human bodies
might not towns be contended for in the same manner
indeed this may be thought too detrimental a scheme to the french interest since they would thus lose the advantage they have over other nations in the superiority of their engineers but when i consider the gallantry and generosity of that people i am persuaded they would never decline putting themselves upon a par with their adversary or as the phrase is making themselves his match
but such reformations are rather to be wished than hoped for i shall content myself therefore with this short hint and return to my narrative
western began now to inquire into the original rise of this quarrel
to which neither blifil nor jones gave any answer but thwackum said surlily i believe the cause is not far off if you beat the bushes well you may find herfind her replied western what
have you been fighting for a wenchask the gentleman in his waistcoat there said thwackum he best knows nay then cries western it is a wench certainlyah tom tom thou art a liquorish dog
but come gentlemen be all friends and go home with me and make final peace over a bottle i ask your pardon sir says thwackum it is no such slight matter for a man of my character to be thus injuriously treated and buffeted by a boy only because i would have done my duty in endeavouring to detect and bring to justice a wanton harlot but indeed the principal fault lies in mr allworthy and yourself for if you put the laws in execution as you ought to do you will soon rid the country of these vermin  i would as soon rid the country of foxes cries western
i think we ought to encourage the recruiting those numbers which we are every day losing in the warbut where is she
prithee tom show me he then began to beat about in the same language and in the same manner as if he had been beating for a hare and at last cried out soho
puss is not far off
here's her form upon my soul i believe i may cry stole away and indeed so he might for he had now discovered the place whence the poor girl had at the beginning of the fray stolen away upon as many feet as a hare generally uses in travelling
sophia now desired her father to return home saying she found herself very faint and apprehended a relapse
the squire immediately complied with his daughter's request for he was the fondest of parents
he earnestly endeavoured to prevail with the whole company to go and sup with him but blifil and thwackum absolutely refused the former saying there were more reasons than he could then mention why he must decline this honour and the latter declaring perhaps rightly that it was not proper for a person of his function to be seen at any place in his present condition
jones was incapable of refusing the pleasure of being with his sophia so on he marched with squire western and his ladies the parson bringing up the rear
this had indeed offered to tarry with his brother thwackum professing his regard for the cloth would not permit him to depart but thwackum would not accept the favour and with no great civility pushed him after mr western
thus ended this bloody fray and thus shall end the fifth book of this history

containing about three weeks
chapter i
of love
in our last book we have been obliged to deal pretty much with the passion of love and in our succeeding book shall be forced to handle this subject still more largely
it may not therefore in this place be improper to apply ourselves to the examination of that modern doctrine by which certain philosophers among many other wonderful discoveries pretend to have found out that there is no such passion in the human breast
whether these philosophers be the same with that surprising sect who are honourably mentioned by the late dr swift as having by the mere force of genius alone without the least assistance of any kind of learning or even reading discovered that profound and invaluable secret that there is no god or whether they are not rather the same with those who some years since very much alarmed the world by showing that there were no such things as virtue or goodness really existing in human nature and who deduced our best actions from pride i will not here presume to determine
in reality i am inclined to suspect that all these several finders of truth are the very identical men who are by others called the finders of gold
the method used in both these searches after truth and after gold being indeed one and the same viz the searching rummaging and examining into a nasty place indeed in the former instances into the nastiest of all places a bad mind
but though in this particular and perhaps in their success the truthfinder and the goldfinder may very properly be compared together yet in modesty surely there can be no comparison between the two for who ever heard of a goldfinder that had the impudence or folly to assert from the ill success of his search that there was no such thing as gold in the world
whereas the truthfinder having raked out that jakes his own mind and being there capable of tracing no ray of divinity nor anything virtuous or good or lovely or loving very fairly honestly and logically concludes that no such things exist in the whole creation
to avoid however all contention if possible with these philosophers if they will be called so and to show our own disposition to accommodate matters peaceably between us we shall here make them some concessions which may possibly put an end to the dispute
first we will grant that many minds and perhaps those of the philosophers are entirely free from the least traces of such a passion
secondly that what is commonly called love namely the desire of satisfying a voracious appetite with a certain quantity of delicate white human flesh is by no means that passion for which i here contend
this is indeed more properly hunger and as no glutton is ashamed to apply the word love to his appetite and to say he loves such and such dishes so may the lover of this kind with equal propriety say he hungers after such and such women
thirdly i will grant which i believe will be a most acceptable concession that this love for which i am an advocate though it satisfies itself in a much more delicate manner doth nevertheless seek its own satisfaction as much as the grossest of all our appetites
and lastly that this love when it operates towards one of a different sex is very apt towards its complete gratification to call in the aid of that hunger which i have mentioned above and which it is so far from abating that it heightens all its delights to a degree scarce imaginable by those who have never been susceptible of any other emotions than what have proceeded from appetite alone
in return to all these concessions i desire of the philosophers to grant that there is in some i believe in many human breasts a kind and benevolent disposition which is gratified by contributing to the happiness of others
that in this gratification alone as in friendship in parental and filial affection as indeed in general philanthropy there is a great and exquisite delight
that if we will not call such disposition love we have no name for it
that though the pleasures arising from such pure love may be heightened and sweetened by the assistance of amorous desires yet the former can subsist alone nor are they destroyed by the intervention of the latter
lastly that esteem and gratitude are the proper motives to love as youth and beauty are to desire and therefore though such desire may naturally cease when age or sickness overtakes its object yet these can have no effect on love nor ever shake or remove from a good mind that sensation or passion which hath gratitude and esteem for its basis
to deny the existence of a passion of which we often see manifest instances seems to be very strange and absurd and can indeed proceed only from that selfadmonition which we have mentioned above but how unfair is this
doth the man who recognizes in his own heart no traces of avarice or ambition conclude therefore that there are no such passions in human nature
why will we not modestly observe the same rule in judging of the good as well as the evil of others
or why in any case will we as shakespear phrases it put the world in our own person  predominant vanity is i am afraid too much concerned here
this is one instance of that adulation which we bestow on our own minds and this almost universally
for there is scarce any man how much soever he may despise the character of a flatterer but will condescend in the meanest manner to flatter himself
to those therefore i apply for the truth of the above observations whose own minds can bear testimony to what i have advanced
examine your heart my good reader and resolve whether you do believe these matters with me
if you do you may now proceed to their exemplification in the following pages if you do not you have i assure you already read more than you have understood and it would be wiser to pursue your business or your pleasures such as they are than to throw away any more of your time in reading what you can neither taste nor comprehend
to treat of the effects of love to you must be as absurd as to discourse on colours to a man born blind since possibly your idea of love may be as absurd as that which we are told such blind man once entertained of the colour scarlet that colour seemed to him to be very much like the sound of a trumpet and love probably may in your opinion very greatly resemble a dish of soup or a surloin of roastbeef
chapter ii
the character of mrs western
her great learning and knowledge of the world and an instance of the deep penetration which she derived from those advantages
the reader hath seen mr western his sister and daughter with young jones and the parson going together to mr western's house where the greater part of the company spent the evening with much joy and festivity
sophia was indeed the only grave person for as to jones though love had now gotten entire possession of his heart yet the pleasing reflection on mr allworthy's recovery and the presence of his mistress joined to some tender looks which she now and then could not refrain from giving him so elevated our heroe that he joined the mirth of the other three who were perhaps as goodhumoured people as any in the world
sophia retained the same gravity of countenance the next morning at breakfast whence she retired likewise earlier than usual leaving her father and aunt together
the squire took no notice of this change in his daughter's disposition
to say the truth though he was somewhat of a politician and had been twice a candidate in the country interest at an election he was a man of no great observation
his sister was a lady of a different turn
she had lived about the court and had seen the world
hence she had acquired all that knowledge which the said world usually communicates and was a perfect mistress of manners customs ceremonies and fashions
nor did her erudition stop here
she had considerably improved her mind by study she had not only read all the modern plays operas oratorios poems and romancesin all which she was a critic but had gone through rapin's history of england eachard's roman history and many french mmoires pour servir  l'histoire to these she had added most of the political pamphlets and journals published within the last twenty years
from which she had attained a very competent skill in politics and could discourse very learnedly on the affairs of europe
she was moreover excellently well skilled in the doctrine of amour and knew better than anybody who and who were together a knowledge which she the more easily attained as her pursuit of it was never diverted by any affairs of her own for either she had no inclinations or they had never been solicited which last is indeed very probable for her masculine person which was near six foot high added to her manner and learning possibly prevented the other sex from regarding her notwithstanding her petticoats in the light of a woman
however as she had considered the matter scientifically she perfectly well knew though she had never practised them all the arts which fine ladies use when they desire to give encouragement or to conceal liking with all the long appendage of smiles ogles glances c as they are at present practised in the beaumonde
to sum the whole no species of disguise or affectation had escaped her notice but as to the plain simple workings of honest nature as she had never seen any such she could know but little of them
by means of this wonderful sagacity mrs western had now as she thought made a discovery of something in the mind of sophia
the first hint of this she took from the behaviour of the young lady in the field of battle and the suspicion which she then conceived was greatly corroborated by some observations which she had made that evening and the next morning
however being greatly cautious to avoid being found in a mistake she carried the secret a whole fortnight in her bosom giving only some oblique hints by simpering winks nods and now and then dropping an obscure word which indeed sufficiently alarmed sophia but did not at all affect her brother
being at length however thoroughly satisfied of the truth of her observation she took an opportunity one morning when she was alone with her brother to interrupt one of his whistles in the following manner  pray brother have you not observed something very extraordinary in my niece latelyno not i answered western is anything the matter with the girli think there is replied she and something of much consequence toowhy she doth not complain of anything  cries western and she hath had the smallpoxbrother returned she girls are liable to other distempers besides the smallpox and sometimes possibly to much worse here western interrupted her with much earnestness and begged her if anything ailed his daughter to acquaint him immediately adding she knew he loved her more than his own soul and that he would send to the world's end for the best physician to her nay nay answered she smiling the distemper is not so terrible but i believe brother you are convinced i know the world and i promise you i was never more deceived in my life if my niece be not most desperately in lovehow
in love cries western in a passion in love without acquainting me
i'll disinherit her i'll turn her out of doors stark naked without a farthing
is all my kindness vor 'ur and vondness o'ur come to this to fall in love without asking me leavebut you will not  answered mrs western turn this daughter whom you love better than your own soul out of doors before you know whether you shall approve her choice
suppose she should have fixed on the very person whom you yourself would wish i hope you would not be angry thenno no  cries western that would make a difference
if she marries the man i would ha' her she may love whom she pleases i shan't trouble my head about that that is spoken answered the sister like a sensible man but i believe the very person she hath chosen would be the very person you would choose for her
i will disclaim all knowledge of the world if it is not so and i believe brother you will allow i have somewhy lookee sister said western i do believe you have as much as any woman and to be sure those are women's matters
you know i don't love to hear you talk about politics they belong to us and petticoats should not meddle but come who is the manmarry  said she you may find him out yourself if you please
you who are so great a politician can be at no great loss
the judgment which can penetrate into the cabinets of princes and discover the secret springs which move the great state wheels in all the political machines of europe must surely with very little difficulty find out what passes in the rude uninformed mind of a girlsister cries the squire i have often warn'd you not to talk the court gibberish to me
i tell you i don't understand the lingo but i can read a journal or the london evening post perhaps indeed there may be now and tan a verse which i can't make much of because half the letters are left out yet i know very well what is meant by that and that our affairs don't go so well as they should do because of bribery and corruptioni pity your country ignorance from my heart cries the ladydo you answered western and i pity your town learning i had rather be anything than a courtier and a presbyterian and a hanoverian too as some people i believe areif you mean me answered she you know i am a woman brother and it signifies nothing what i am
besidesi do know you are a woman cries the squire and it's well for thee that art one if hadst been a man i promise thee i had lent thee a flick long agoay there said she in that flick lies all your fancied superiority
your bodies and not your brains are stronger than ours
believe me it is well for you that you are able to beat us or such is the superiority of our understanding we should make all of you what the brave and wise and witty and polite are alreadyour slavesi am glad i know your mind answered the squire
but we'll talk more of this matter another time
at present do tell me what man is it you mean about my daughterhold a moment said she while i digest that sovereign contempt i have for your sex or else i ought to be angry too with you
therei have made a shift to gulp it down
and now good politic sir what think you of mr blifil
did she not faint away on seeing him lie breathless on the ground
did she not after he was recovered turn pale again the moment we came up to that part of the field where he stood
and pray what else should be the occasion of all her melancholy that night at supper the next morning and indeed ever since'fore george cries the squire now you mind me on't i remember it all
it is certainly so and i am glad on't with all my heart
i knew sophy was a good girl and would not fall in love to make me angry
i was never more rejoiced in my life for nothing can lie so handy together as our two estates
i had this matter in my head some time ago for certainly the two estates are in a manner joined together in matrimony already and it would be a thousand pities to part them
it is true indeed there be larger estates in the kingdom but not in this county and i had rather bate something than marry my daughter among strangers and foreigners
besides most o' zuch great estates be in the hands of lords and i heate the very name of themmun
well but sister what would you advise me to do for i tell you women know these matters better than we dooh your humble servant sir answered the lady we are obliged to you for allowing us a capacity in anything
since you are pleased then most politic sir to ask my advice i think you may propose the match to allworthy yourself
there is no indecorum in the proposal's coming from the parent of either side
king alcinous in mr pope's odyssey offers his daughter to ulysses
i need not caution so politic a person not to say that your daughter is in love that would indeed be against all ruleswell said the squire i will propose it but i shall certainly lend un a flick if he should refuse me fear not cries mrs western the match is too advantageous to be refused i don't know that answered the squire allworthy is a queer bch and money hath no effect o'un brother said the lady your politics astonish me
are you really to be imposed on by professions
do you think mr allworthy hath more contempt for money than other men because he professes more
such credulity would better become one of us weak women than that wise sex which heaven hath formed for politicians
indeed brother you would make a fine plenipo to negotiate with the french
they would soon persuade you that they take towns out of mere defensive principles sister answered the squire with much scorn let your friends at court answer for the towns taken as you are a woman i shall lay no blame upon you for i suppose they are wiser than to trust women with secrets he accompanied this with so sarcastical a laugh that mrs western could bear no longer
she had been all this time fretted in a tender part for she was indeed very deeply skilled in these matters and very violent in them and therefore burst forth in a rage declared her brother to be both a clown and a blockhead and that she would stay no longer in his house
the squire though perhaps he had never read machiavel was however in many points a perfect politician
he strongly held all those wise tenets which are so well inculcated in that politicoperipatetic school of exchangealley
he knew the just value and only use of money viz to lay it up
he was likewise well skilled in the exact value of reversions expectations c and had often considered the amount of his sister's fortune and the chance which he or his posterity had of inheriting it
this he was infinitely too wise to sacrifice to a trifling resentment
when he found therefore he had carried matters too far he began to think of reconciling them which was no very difficult task as the lady had great affection for her brother and still greater for her niece and though too susceptible of an affront offered to her skill in politics on which she much valued herself was a woman of a very extraordinary good and sweet disposition
having first therefore laid violent hands on the horses for whose escape from the stable no place but the window was left open he next applied himself to his sister softened and soothed her by unsaying all he had said and by assertions directly contrary to those which had incensed her
lastly he summoned the eloquence of sophia to his assistance who besides a most graceful and winning address had the advantage of being heard with great favour and partiality by her aunt
the result of the whole was a kind smile from mrs western who said brother you are absolutely a perfect croat but as those have their use in the army of the empress queen so you likewise have some good in you
i will therefore once more sign a treaty of peace with you and see that you do not infringe it on your side at least as you are so excellent a politician i may expect you will keep your leagues like the french till your interest calls upon you to break them    chapter iii
containing two defiances to the critics
the squire having settled matters with his sister as we have seen in the last chapter was so greatly impatient to communicate the proposal to allworthy that mrs western had the utmost difficulty to prevent him from visiting that gentleman in his sickness for this purpose
mr allworthy had been engaged to dine with mr western at the time when he was taken ill
he was therefore no sooner discharged out of the custody of physic but he thought as was usual with him on all occasions both the highest and the lowest of fulfilling his engagement
in the interval between the time of the dialogue in the last chapter and this day of public entertainment sophia had from certain obscure hints thrown out by her aunt collected some apprehension that the sagacious lady suspected her passion for jones
she now resolved to take this opportunity of wiping out all such suspicion and for that purpose to put an entire constraint on her behaviour
first she endeavoured to conceal a throbbing melancholy heart with the utmost sprightliness in her countenance and the highest gaiety in her manner
secondly she addressed her whole discourse to mr blifil and took not the least notice of poor jones the whole day
the squire was so delighted with this conduct of his daughter that he scarce eat any dinner and spent almost his whole time in watching opportunities of conveying signs of his approbation by winks and nods to his sister who was not at first altogether so pleased with what she saw as was her brother
in short sophia so greatly overacted her part that her aunt was at first staggered and began to suspect some affectation in her niece but as she was herself a woman of great art so she soon attributed this to extreme art in sophia
she remembered the many hints she had given her niece concerning her being in love and imagined the young lady had taken this way to rally her out of her opinion by an overacted civility a notion that was greatly corroborated by the excessive gaiety with which the whole was accompanied
we cannot here avoid remarking that this conjecture would have been better founded had sophia lived ten years in the air of grosvenor square where young ladies do learn a wonderful knack of rallying and playing with that passion which is a mighty serious thing in woods and groves an hundred miles distant from london
to say the truth in discovering the deceit of others it matters much that our own art be wound up if i may use the expression in the same key with theirs for very artful men sometimes miscarry by fancying others wiser or in other words greater knaves than they really are
as this observation is pretty deep i will illustrate it by the following short story
three countrymen were pursuing a wiltshire thief through brentford
the simplest of them seeing the wiltshire house written under a sign advised his companions to enter it for there most probably they would find their countryman
the second who was wiser laughed at this simplicity but the third who was wiser still answered let us go in however for he may think we should not suspect him of going amongst his own countrymen they accordingly went in and searched the house and by that means missed overtaking the thief who was at that time but a little way before them and who as they all knew but had never once reflected could not read
the reader will pardon a digression in which so invaluable a secret is communicated since every gamester will agree how necessary it is to know exactly the play of another in order to countermine him
this will moreover afford a reason why the wiser man as is often seen is the bubble of the weaker and why many simple and innocent characters are so generally misunderstood and misrepresented but what is most material this will account for the deceit which sophia put on her politic aunt
dinner being ended and the company retired into the garden mr western who was thoroughly convinced of the certainty of what his sister had told him took mr allworthy aside and very bluntly proposed a match between sophia and young mr blifil
mr allworthy was not one of those men whose hearts flutter at any unexpected and sudden tidings of worldly profit
his mind was indeed tempered with that philosophy which becomes a man and a christian
he affected no absolute superiority to all pleasure and pain to all joy and grief but was not at the same time to be discomposed and ruffled by every accidental blast by every smile or frown of fortune
he received therefore mr western's proposal without any visible emotion or without any alteration of countenance
he said the alliance was such as he sincerely wished then launched forth into a very just encomium on the young lady's merit acknowledged the offer to be advantageous in point of fortune and after thanking mr western for the good opinion he had professed of his nephew concluded that if the young people liked each other he should be very desirous to complete the affair
western was a little disappointed at mr allworthy's answer which was not so warm as he expected
he treated the doubt whether the young people might like one another with great contempt saying that parents were the best judges of proper matches for their children that for his part he should insist on the most resigned obedience from his daughter and if any young fellow could refuse such a bedfellow he was his humble servant and hoped there was no harm done  allworthy endeavoured to soften this resentment by many eulogiums on sophia declaring he had no doubt but that mr blifil would very gladly receive the offer but all was ineffectual he could obtain no other answer from the squire buti say no morei humbly hope there's no harm donethat's all which words he repeated at least a hundred times before they parted
allworthy was too well acquainted with his neighbour to be offended at this behaviour and though he was so averse to the rigour which some parents exercise on their children in the article of marriage that he had resolved never to force his nephew's inclinations he was nevertheless much pleased with the prospect of this union for the whole country resounded the praises of sophia and he had himself greatly admired the uncommon endowments of both her mind and person
to which i believe we may add the consideration of her vast fortune which though he was too sober to be intoxicated with it he was too sensible to despise
and here in defiance of all the barking critics in the world i must and will introduce a digression concerning true wisdom of which mr allworthy was in reality as great a pattern as he was of goodness
true wisdom then notwithstanding all which mr hogarth's poor poet may have writ against riches and in spite of all which any rich wellfed divine may have preached against pleasure consists not in the contempt of either of these
a man may have as much wisdom in the possession of an affluent fortune as any beggar in the streets or may enjoy a handsome wife or a hearty friend and still remain as wise as any sour popish recluse who buries all his social faculties and starves his belly while he well lashes his back
to say truth the wisest man is the likeliest to possess all worldly blessings in an eminent degree for as that moderation which wisdom prescribes is the surest way to useful wealth so can it alone qualify us to taste many pleasures
the wise man gratifies every appetite and every passion while the fool sacrifices all the rest to pall and satiate one
it may be objected that very wise men have been notoriously avaricious
i answer not wise in that instance
it may likewise be said that the wisest men have been in their youth immoderately fond of pleasure
i answer they were not wise then
wisdom in short whose lessons have been represented as so hard to learn by those who never were at her school only teaches us to extend a simple maxim universally known and followed even in the lowest life a little farther than that life carries it
and this is not to buy at too dear a price
now whoever takes this maxim abroad with him into the grand market of the world and constantly applies it to honours to riches to pleasures and to every other commodity which that market affords is i will venture to affirm a wise man and must be so acknowledged in the worldly sense of the word for he makes the best of bargains since in reality he purchases everything at the price only of a little trouble and carries home all the good things i have mentioned while he keeps his health his innocence and his reputation the common prices which are paid for them by others entire and to himself
from this moderation likewise he learns two other lessons which complete his character
first never to be intoxicated when he hath made the best bargain nor dejected when the market is empty or when its commodities are too dear for his purchase
but i must remember on what subject i am writing and not trespass too far on the patience of a goodnatured critic
here therefore i put an end to the chapter
chapter iv
containing sundry curious matters
as soon as mr allworthy returned home he took mr blifil apart and after some preface communicated to him the proposal which had been made by mr western and at the same time informed him how agreeable this match would be to himself
the charms of sophia had not made the least impression on blifil not that his heart was preengaged neither was he totally insensible of beauty or had any aversion to women but his appetites were by nature so moderate that he was able by philosophy or by study or by some other method easily to subdue them and as to that passion which we have treated of in the first chapter of this book he had not the least tincture of it in his whole composition
but though he was so entirely free from that mixed passion of which we there treated and of which the virtues and beauty of sophia formed so notable an object yet was he altogether as well furnished with some other passions that promised themselves very full gratification in the young lady's fortune
such were avarice and ambition which divided the dominion of his mind between them
he had more than once considered the possession of this fortune as a very desirable thing and had entertained some distant views concerning it but his own youth and that of the young lady and indeed principally a reflection that mr western might marry again and have more children had restrained him from too hasty or eager a pursuit
this last and most material objection was now in great measure removed as the proposal came from mr western himself
blifil therefore after a very short hesitation answered mr allworthy that matrimony was a subject on which he had not yet thought but that he was so sensible of his friendly and fatherly care that he should in all things submit himself to his pleasure
allworthy was naturally a man of spirit and his present gravity arose from true wisdom and philosophy not from any original phlegm in his disposition for he had possessed much fire in his youth and had married a beautiful woman for love
he was not therefore greatly pleased with this cold answer of his nephew nor could he help launching forth into the praises of sophia and expressing some wonder that the heart of a young man could be impregnable to the force of such charms unless it was guarded by some prior affection
blifil assured him he had no such guard and then proceeded to discourse so wisely and religiously on love and marriage that he would have stopt the mouth of a parent much less devoutly inclined than was his uncle
in the end the good man was satisfied that his nephew far from having any objections to sophia had that esteem for her which in sober and virtuous minds is the sure foundation of friendship and love
and as he doubted not but the lover would in a little time become altogether as agreeable to his mistress he foresaw great happiness arising to all parties by so proper and desirable an union
with mr blifil's consent therefore he wrote the next morning to mr western acquainting him that his nephew had very thankfully and gladly received the proposal and would be ready to wait on the young lady whenever she should be pleased to accept his visit
western was much pleased with this letter and immediately returned an answer in which without having mentioned a word to his daughter he appointed that very afternoon for opening the scene of courtship
as soon as he had dispatched this messenger he went in quest of his sister whom he found reading and expounding the gazette to parson supple
to this exposition he was obliged to attend near a quarter of an hour though with great violence to his natural impetuosity before he was suffered to speak
at length however he found an opportunity of acquainting the lady that he had business of great consequence to impart to her to which she answered brother i am entirely at your service
things look so well in the north that i was never in a better humour  the parson then withdrawing western acquainted her with all which had passed and desired her to communicate the affair to sophia which she readily and chearfully undertook though perhaps her brother was a little obliged to that agreeable northern aspect which had so delighted her that he heard no comment on his proceedings for they were certainly somewhat too hasty and violent
chapter v  in which is related what passed between sophia and her aunt
sophia was in her chamber reading when her aunt came in
the moment she saw mrs western she shut the book with so much eagerness that the good lady could not forbear asking her what book that was which she seemed so much afraid of showing
upon my word madam answered sophia it is a book which i am neither ashamed nor afraid to own i have read
it is the production of a young lady of fashion whose good understanding i think doth honour to her sex and whose good heart is an honour to human nature mrs western then took up the book and immediately after threw it down sayingyes the author is of a very good family but she is not much among people one knows
i have never read it for the best judges say there is not much in iti dare not madam set up my own opinion says sophia against the best judges but there appears to me a great deal of human nature in it and in many parts so much true tenderness and delicacy that it hath cost me many a tearay and do you love to cry then says the aunt
i love a tender sensation answered the niece and would pay the price of a tear for it at any timewell but show me said the aunt what was you reading when i came in there was something very tender in that i believe and very loving too
you blush my dear sophia
ah
child you should read books which would teach you a little hypocrisy which would instruct you how to hide your thoughts a little betteri hope madam answered sophia i have no thoughts which i ought to be ashamed of discoveringashamed
no cries the aunt i don't think you have any thoughts which you ought to be ashamed of and yet child you blushed just now when i mentioned the word loving
dear sophy be assured you have not one thought which i am not well acquainted with as well child as the french are with our motions long before we put them in execution
did you think child because you have been able to impose upon your father that you could impose upon me
do you imagine i did not know the reason of your overacting all that friendship for mr blifil yesterday
i have seen a little too much of the world to be so deceived
nay nay do not blush again
i tell you it is a passion you need not be ashamed of
it is a passion i myself approve and have already brought your father into the approbation of it
indeed i solely consider your inclination for i would always have that gratified if possible though one may sacrifice higher prospects
come i have news which will delight your very soul
make me your confident and i will undertake you shall be happy to the very extent of your wishes la madam says sophia looking more foolishly than ever she did in her life i know not what to saywhy madam should you suspectnay no dishonesty returned mrs western
consider you are speaking to one of your own sex to an aunt and i hope you are convinced you speak to a friend
consider you are only revealing to me what i know already and what i plainly saw yesterday through that most artful of all disguises which you had put on and which must have deceived any one who had not perfectly known the world
lastly consider it is a passion which i highly approve la madam says sophia you come upon one so unawares and on a sudden
to be sure madam i am not blindand certainly if it be a fault to see all human perfections assembled togetherbut is it possible my father and you madam can see with my eyes i tell you answered the aunt we do entirely approve and this very afternoon your father hath appointed for you to receive your lover my father this afternoon cries sophia with the blood starting from her faceyes child said the aunt this afternoon
you know the impetuosity of my brother's temper
i acquainted him with the passion which i first discovered in you that evening when you fainted away in the field
i saw it in your fainting
i saw it immediately upon your recovery
i saw it that evening at supper and the next morning at breakfast you know child i have seen the world
well i no sooner acquainted my brother but he immediately wanted to propose it to allworthy
he proposed it yesterday allworthy consented as to be sure he must with joy and this afternoon i tell you you are to put on all your best airs  this afternoon cries sophia
dear aunt you frighten me out of my senses o my dear said the aunt you will soon come to yourself again for he is a charming young fellow that's the truth on't  nay i will own says sophia i know none with such perfections
so brave and yet so gentle so witty yet so inoffensive so humane so civil so genteel so handsome
what signifies his being base born when compared with such qualifications as these base born
what do you mean said the aunt mr blifil base born sophia turned instantly pale at this name and faintly repeated it
upon which the aunt cried mr blifilay mr blifil of whom else have we been talking good heavens answered sophia ready to sink of mr jones i thought i am sure i know no other who deserves i protest cries the aunt you frighten me in your turn
is it mr jones and not mr blifil who is the object of your affection mr blifil repeated sophia
sure it is impossible you can be in earnest if you are i am the most miserable woman alive mrs western now stood a few moments silent while sparks of fiery rage flashed from her eyes
at length collecting all her force of voice she thundered forth in the following articulate sounds  and is it possible you can think of disgracing your family by allying yourself to a bastard
can the blood of the westerns submit to such contamination
if you have not sense sufficient to restrain such monstrous inclinations i thought the pride of our family would have prevented you from giving the least encouragement to so base an affection much less did i imagine you would ever have had the assurance to own it to my face  madam answered sophia trembling what i have said you have extorted from me
i do not remember to have ever mentioned the name of mr jones with approbation to any one before nor should i now had i not conceived he had your approbation
whatever were my thoughts of that poor unhappy young man i intended to have carried them with me to my graveto that grave where only now i find i am to seek repose here she sunk down in her chair drowned in her tears and in all the moving silence of unutterable grief presented a spectacle which must have affected almost the hardest heart
all this tender sorrow however raised no compassion in her aunt
on the contrary she now fell into the most violent rageand i would rather she cried in a most vehement voice follow you to your grave than i would see you disgrace yourself and your family by such a match
o heavens
could i have ever suspected that i should live to hear a niece of mine declare a passion for such a fellow
you are the firstyes miss western you are the first of your name who ever entertained so grovelling a thought
a family so noted for the prudence of its womenhere she ran on a full quarter of an hour till having exhausted her breath rather than her rage she concluded with threatening to go immediately and acquaint her brother
sophia then threw herself at her feet and laying hold of her hands begged her with tears to conceal what she had drawn from her urging the violence of her father's temper and protesting that no inclinations of hers should ever prevail with her to do anything which might offend him
mrs western stood a moment looking at her and then having recollected herself said that on one consideration only she would keep the secret from her brother and this was that sophia should promise to entertain mr blifil that very afternoon as her lover and to regard him as the person who was to be her husband  poor sophia was too much in her aunt's power to deny her anything positively she was obliged to promise that she would see mr blifil and be as civil to him as possible but begged her aunt that the match might not be hurried on
she said mr blifil was by no means agreeable to her and she hoped her father would be prevailed on not to make her the most wretched of women  mrs western assured her that the match was entirely agreed upon and that nothing could or should prevent it
i must own said she i looked on it as on a matter of indifference nay perhaps had some scruples about it before which were actually got over by my thinking it highly agreeable to your own inclinations but now i regard it as the most eligible thing in the world nor shall there be if i can prevent it a moment of time lost on the occasion  sophia replied delay at least madam i may expect from both your goodness and my father's
surely you will give me time to endeavour to get the better of so strong a disinclination as i have at present to this person  the aunt answered she knew too much of the world to be so deceived that as she was sensible another man had her affections she should persuade mr western to hasten the match as much as possible
it would be bad politics indeed added she to protract a siege when the enemy's army is at hand and in danger of relieving it
no no sophy said she as i am convinced you have a violent passion which you can never satisfy with honour i will do all i can to put your honour out of the care of your family for when you are married those matters will belong only to the consideration of your husband
i hope child you will always have prudence enough to act as becomes you but if you should not marriage hath saved many a woman from ruin  sophia well understood what her aunt meant but did not think proper to make her an answer
however she took a resolution to see mr blifil and to behave to him as civilly as she could for on that condition only she obtained a promise from her aunt to keep secret the liking which her ill fortune rather than any scheme of mrs western had unhappily drawn from her
chapter vi
containing a dialogue between sophia and mrs honour which may a little relieve those tender affections which the foregoing scene may have raised in the mind of a goodnatured reader
mrs western having obtained that promise from her niece which we have seen in the last chapter withdrew and presently after arrived mrs honour
she was at work in a neighbouring apartment and had been summoned to the keyhole by some vociferation in the preceding dialogue where she had continued during the remaining part of it
at her entry into the room she found sophia standing motionless with the tears trickling from her eyes
upon which she immediately ordered a proper quantity of tears into her own eyes and then began o gemini my dear lady what is the matternothing cries sophia
nothing
o dear madam answers honour you must not tell me that when your ladyship is in this taking and when there hath been such a preamble between your ladyship and madam westerndon't teaze me  cries sophia i tell you nothing is the matter
good heavens
why was i bornnay madam says mrs honour you shall never persuade me that your la'ship can lament yourself so for nothing
to be sure i am but a servant but to be sure i have been always faithful to your la'ship and to be sure i would serve your la'ship with my lifemy dear honour says sophia 'tis not in thy power to be of any service to me
i am irretrievably undoneheaven forbid answered the waitingwoman but if i can't be of any service to you pray tell me madamit will be some comfort to me to knowpray dear ma'am tell me what's the mattermy father cries sophia is going to marry me to a man i both despise and hateo dear ma'am answered the other who is this wicked man
for to be sure he is very bad or your la'ship would not despise himhis name is poison to my tongue  replied sophia thou wilt know it too soon indeed to confess the truth she knew it already and therefore was not very inquisitive as to that point
she then proceeded thus i don't pretend to give your la'ship advice whereof your la'ship knows much better than i can pretend to being but a servant but ifackins
no father in england should marry me against my consent
and to be sure the 'squire is so good that if he did but know your la'ship despises and hates the young man to be sure he would not desire you to marry him
and if your la'ship would but give me leave to tell my master so
to be sure it would be more properer to come from your own mouth but as your la'ship doth not care to foul your tongue with his nasty nameyou are mistaken honour says sophia my father was determined before he ever thought fit to mention it to memore shame for him cries honour you are to go to bed to him and not master and thof a man may be a very proper man yet every woman mayn't think him handsome alike
i am sure my master would never act in this manner of his own head
i wish some people would trouble themselves only with what belongs to them they would not i believe like to be served so if it was their own case for though i am a maid i can easily believe as how all men are not equally agreeable
and what signifies your la'ship having so great a fortune if you can't please yourself with the man you think most handsomest
well i say nothing but to be sure it is a pity some folks had not been better born nay as for that matter i should not mind it myself but then there is not so much money and what of that
your la'ship hath money enough for both and where can your la'ship bestow your fortune better
for to be sure every one must allow that he is the most handsomest charmingest finest tallest properest man in the worldwhat do you mean by running on in this manner to me cries sophia with a very grave countenance
have i ever given any encouragement for these libertiesnay ma'am i ask pardon i meant no harm answered she but to be sure the poor gentleman hath run in my head ever since i saw him this morning
to be sure if your la'ship had but seen him just now you must have pitied him
poor gentleman
i wishes some misfortune hath not happened to him for he hath been walking about with his arms across and looking so melancholy all this morning i vow and protest it made me almost cry to see himto see whom says sophia
poor mr jones  answered honour
see him
why where did you see him cries sophia
by the canal ma'am says honour
there he hath been walking all this morning and at last there he laid himself down i believe he lies there still
to be sure if it had not been for my modesty being a maid as i am i should have gone and spoke to him
do ma'am let me go and see only for a fancy whether he is there stillpugh  says sophia
there
no no what should he do there
he is gone before this time to be sure
besides whywhatwhy should you go to see
besides i want you for something else
go fetch me my hat and gloves
i shall walk with my aunt in the grove before dinner honour did immediately as she was bid and sophia put her hat on when looking in the glass she fancied the ribbon with which her hat was tied did not become her and so sent her maid back again for a ribbon of a different colour and then giving mrs honour repeated charges not to leave her work on any account as she said it was in violent haste and must be finished that very day she muttered something more about going to the grove and then sallied out the contrary way and walked as fast as her tender trembling limbs could carry her directly towards the canal
jones had been there as mrs honour had told her he had indeed spent two hours there that morning in melancholy contemplation on his sophia and had gone out from the garden at one door the moment she entered it at another
so that those unlucky minutes which had been spent in changing the ribbons had prevented the lovers from meeting at this timea most unfortunate accident from which my fair readers will not fail to draw a very wholesome lesson
and here i strictly forbid all male critics to intermeddle with a circumstance which i have recounted only for the sake of the ladies and upon which they only are at liberty to comment
chapter vii
a picture of formal courtship in miniature as it always ought to be drawn and a scene of a tenderer kind painted at full length
it was well remarked by one and perhaps by more that misfortunes do not come single
this wise maxim was now verified by sophia who was not only disappointed of seeing the man she loved but had the vexation of being obliged to dress herself out in order to receive a visit from the man she hated
that afternoon mr western for the first time acquainted his daughter with his intention telling her he knew very well that she had heard it before from her aunt
sophia looked very grave upon this nor could she prevent a few pearls from stealing into her eyes
come come  says western none of your maidenish airs i know all i assure you sister hath told me all  is it possible says sophia that my aunt can have betrayed me alreadyay ay says western betrayed you
ay
why you betrayed yourself yesterday at dinner
you showed your fancy very plainly i think
but you young girls never know what you would be at
so you cry because i am going to marry you to the man you are in love with
your mother i remember whimpered and whined just in the same manner but it was all over within twentyfour hours after we were married mr blifil is a brisk young man and will soon put an end to your squeamishness
come chear up chear up i expect un every minute  sophia was now convinced that her aunt had behaved honourably to her and she determined to go through that disagreeable afternoon with as much resolution as possible and without giving the least suspicion in the world to her father
mr blifil soon arrived and mr western soon after withdrawing left the young couple together
here a long silence of near a quarter of an hour ensued for the gentleman who was to begin the conversation had all the unbecoming modesty which consists in bashfulness
he often attempted to speak and as often suppressed his words just at the very point of utterance
at last out they broke in a torrent of farfetched and highstrained compliments which were answered on her side by downcast looks half bows and civil monosyllables
blifil from his inexperience in the ways of women and from his conceit of himself took this behaviour for a modest assent to his courtship and when to shorten a scene which she could no longer support sophia rose up and left the room he imputed that too merely to bashfulness and comforted himself that he should soon have enough of her company
he was indeed perfectly well satisfied with his prospect of success for as to that entire and absolute possession of the heart of his mistress which romantic lovers require the very idea of it never entered his head
her fortune and her person were the sole objects of his wishes of which he made no doubt soon to obtain the absolute property as mr western's mind was so earnestly bent on the match and as he well knew the strict obedience which sophia was always ready to pay to her father's will and the greater still which her father would exact if there was occasion
this authority therefore together with the charms which he fancied in his own person and conversation could not fail he thought of succeeding with a young lady whose inclinations were he doubted not entirely disengaged
of jones he certainly had not even the least jealousy and i have often thought it wonderful that he had not
perhaps he imagined the character which jones bore all over the country how justly let the reader determine of being one of the wildest fellows in england might render him odious to a lady of the most exemplary modesty
perhaps his suspicions might be laid asleep by the behaviour of sophia and of jones himself when they were all in company together
lastly and indeed principally he was well assured there was not another self in the case
he fancied that he knew jones to the bottom and had in reality a great contempt for his understanding for not being more attached to his own interest
he had no apprehension that jones was in love with sophia and as for any lucrative motives he imagined they would sway very little with so silly a fellow
blifil moreover thought the affair of molly seagrim still went on and indeed believed it would end in marriage for jones really loved him from his childhood and had kept no secret from him till his behaviour on the sickness of mr allworthy had entirely alienated his heart and it was by means of the quarrel which had ensued on this occasion and which was not yet reconciled that mr blifil knew nothing of the alteration which had happened in the affection which jones had formerly borne towards molly
from these reasons therefore mr blifil saw no bar to his success with sophia
he concluded her behaviour was like that of all other young ladies on a first visit from a lover and it had indeed entirely answered his expectations
mr western took care to waylay the lover at his exit from his mistress
he found him so elevated with his success so enamoured with his daughter and so satisfied with her reception of him that the old gentleman began to caper and dance about his hall and by many other antic actions to express the extravagance of his joy for he had not the least command over any of his passions and that which had at any time the ascendant in his mind hurried him to the wildest excesses
as soon as blifil was departed which was not till after many hearty kisses and embraces bestowed on him by western the good squire went instantly in quest of his daughter whom he no sooner found than he poured forth the most extravagant raptures bidding her chuse what clothes and jewels she pleased and declaring that he had no other use for fortune but to make her happy
he then caressed her again and again with the utmost profusion of fondness called her by the most endearing names and protested she was his only joy on earth
sophia perceiving her father in this fit of affection which she did not absolutely know the reason of for fits of fondness were not unusual to him though this was rather more violent than ordinary thought she should never have a better opportunity of disclosing herself than at present as far at least as regarded mr blifil and she too well foresaw the necessity which she should soon be under of coming to a full explanation
after having thanked the squire therefore for all his professions of kindness she added with a look full of inexpressible softness and is it possible my papa can be so good to place all his joy in his sophy's happiness which western having confirmed by a great oath and a kiss she then laid hold of his hand and falling on her knees after many warm and passionate declarations of affection and duty she begged him not to make her the most miserable creature on earth by forcing her to marry a man whom she detested
this i entreat of you dear sir said she for your sake as well as my own since you are so very kind to tell me your happiness depends on minehow
what says western staring wildly
oh
sir continued she not only your poor sophy's happiness her very life her being depends upon your granting her request
i cannot live with mr blifil
to force me into this marriage would be killing meyou can't live with mr blifil says western
no upon my soul i can't answered sophia
then die and be dd  cries he spurning her from him
oh
sir cries sophia catching hold of the skirt of his coat take pity on me i beseech you
don't look and say such cruelcan you be unmoved while you see your sophy in this dreadful condition
can the best of fathers break my heart
will he kill me by the most painful cruel lingering deathpooh
pooh cries the squire all stuff and nonsense all maidenish tricks
kill you indeed
will marriage kill youoh
sir  answered sophia such a marriage is worse than death
he is not even indifferent i hate and detest himif you detest un never so much cries western you shall ha'un this he bound by an oath too shocking to repeat and after many violent asseverations concluded in these words i am resolved upon the match and unless you consent to it i will not give you a groat not a single farthing no though i saw you expiring with famine in the street i would not relieve you with a morsel of bread
this is my fixed resolution and so i leave you to consider on it he then broke from her with such violence that her face dashed against the floor and he burst directly out of the room leaving poor sophia prostrate on the ground
when western came into the hall he there found jones who seeing his friend looking wild pale and almost breathless could not forbear enquiring the reason of all these melancholy appearances
upon which the squire immediately acquainted him with the whole matter concluding with bitter denunciations against sophia and very pathetic lamentations of the misery of all fathers who are so unfortunate to have daughters
jones to whom all the resolutions which had been taken in favour of blifil were yet a secret was at first almost struck dead with this relation but recovering his spirits a little mere despair as he afterwards said inspired him to mention a matter to mr western which seemed to require more impudence than a human forehead was ever gifted with
he desired leave to go to sophia that he might endeavour to obtain her concurrence with her father's inclinations
if the squire had been as quicksighted as he was remarkable for the contrary passion might at present very well have blinded him
he thanked jones for offering to undertake the office and said go go prithee try what canst do and then swore many execrable oaths that he would turn her out of doors unless she consented to the match
chapter viii
the meeting between jones and sophia
jones departed instantly in quest of sophia whom he found just risen from the ground where her father had left her with the tears trickling from her eyes and the blood running from her lips
he presently ran to her and with a voice full at once of tenderness and terrour cried o my sophia what means this dreadful sight she looked softly at him for a moment before she spoke and then said mr jones for heaven's sake how came you hereleave me i beseech you this momentdo not says he impose so harsh a command upon memy heart bleeds faster than those lips
o sophia how easily could i drain my veins to preserve one drop of that dear bloodi have too many obligations to you already answered she for sure you meant them such here she looked at him tenderly almost a minute and then bursting into an agony cried oh mr jones why did you save my life
my death would have been happier for us bothhappier for us both cried he
could racks or wheels kill me so painfully as sophia'si cannot bear the dreadful sound
do i live but for her  both his voice and looks were full of inexpressible tenderness when he spoke these words and at the same time he laid gently hold on her hand which she did not withdraw from him to say the truth she hardly knew what she did or suffered
a few moments now passed in silence between these lovers while his eyes were eagerly fixed on sophia and hers declining towards the ground at last she recovered strength enough to desire him again to leave her for that her certain ruin would be the consequence of their being found together adding oh mr jones you know not you know not what hath passed this cruel afternooni know all my sophia answered he your cruel father hath told me all and he himself hath sent me hither to youmy father sent you to me replied she sure you dreamwould to heaven cries he it was but a dream
oh sophia your father hath sent me to you to be an advocate for my odious rival to solicit you in his favour
i took any means to get access to you
o speak to me sophia
comfort my bleeding heart
sure no one ever loved ever doated like me
do not unkindly withhold this dear this soft this gentle handone moment perhaps tears you for ever from menothing less than this cruel occasion could i believe have ever conquered the respect and awe with which you have inspired me she stood a moment silent and covered with confusion then lifting up her eyes gently towards him she cried what would mr jones have me sayo do but promise cries he that you never will give yourself to blifilname not answered she the detested sound
be assured i never will give him what is in my power to withhold from himnow then cries he while you are so perfectly kind go a little farther and add that i may hopealas says she mr jones whither will you drive me
what hope have i to bestow
you know my father's intentionsbut i know answered he your compliance with them cannot be compelledwhat says she must be the dreadful consequence of my disobedience
my own ruin is my least concern
i cannot bear the thoughts of being the cause of my father's miseryhe is himself the cause cries jones by exacting a power over you which nature hath not given him
think on the misery which i am to suffer if i am to lose you and see on which side pity will turn the balancethink of it replied she can you imagine i do not feel the ruin which i must bring on you should i comply with your desire
it is that thought which gives me resolution to bid you fly from me for ever and avoid your own destructioni fear no destruction cries he but the loss of sophia
if you would save me from the most bitter agonies recall that cruel sentence
indeed i can never part with you indeed i cannot  the lovers now stood both silent and trembling sophia being unable to withdraw her hand from jones and he almost as unable to hold it when the scene which i believe some of my readers will think had lasted long enough was interrupted by one of so different a nature that we shall reserve the relation of it for a different chapter
chapter ix
being of a much more tempestuous kind than the former
before we proceed with what now happened to our lovers it may be proper to recount what had past in the hall during their tender interview
soon after jones had left mr western in the manner above mentioned his sister came to him and was presently informed of all that had passed between her brother and sophia relating to blifil
this behaviour in her niece the good lady construed to be an absolute breach of the condition on which she had engaged to keep her love for mr jones a secret
she considered herself therefore at full liberty to reveal all she knew to the squire which she immediately did in the most explicit terms and without any ceremony or preface
the idea of a marriage between jones and his daughter had never once entered into the squire's head either in the warmest minutes of his affection towards that young man or from suspicion or on any other occasion
he did indeed consider a parity of fortune and circumstances to be physically as necessary an ingredient in marriage as difference of sexes or any other essential and had no more apprehension of his daughter's falling in love with a poor man than with any animal of a different species
he became therefore like one thunderstruck at his sister's relation
he was at first incapable of making any answer having been almost deprived of his breath by the violence of the surprize
this however soon returned and as is usual in other cases after an intermission with redoubled force and fury
the first use he made of the power of speech after his recovery from the sudden effects of his astonishment was to discharge a round volley of oaths and imprecations
after which he proceeded hastily to the apartment where he expected to find the lovers and murmured or rather indeed roared forth intentions of revenge every step he went
as when two doves or two woodpigeons or as when strephon and phyllis for that comes nearest to the mark are retired into some pleasant solitary grove to enjoy the delightful conversation of love that bashful boy who cannot speak in public and is never a good companion to more than two at a time here while every object is serene should hoarse thunder burst suddenly through the shattered clouds and rumbling roll along the sky the frightened maid starts from the mossy bank or verdant turf the pale livery of death succeeds the red regimentals in which love had before drest her cheeks fear shakes her whole frame and her lover scarce supports her trembling tottering limbs
or as when two gentlemen strangers to the wondrous wit of the place are cracking a bottle together at some inn or tavern at salisbury if the great dowdy who acts the part of a madman as well as some of his setterson do that of a fool should rattle his chains and dreadfully hum forth the grumbling catch along the gallery the frighted strangers stand aghast scared at the horrid sound they seek some place of shelter from the approaching danger and if the wellbarred windows did admit their exit would venture their necks to escape the threatening fury now coming upon them
so trembled poor sophia so turned she pale at the noise of her father who in a voice most dreadful to hear came on swearing cursing and vowing the destruction of jones
to say the truth i believe the youth himself would from some prudent considerations have preferred another place of abode at this time had his terror on sophia's account given him liberty to reflect a moment on what any otherways concerned himself than as his love made him partake whatever affected her
and now the squire having burst open the door beheld an object which instantly suspended all his fury against jones this was the ghastly appearance of sophia who had fainted away in her lover's arms
this tragical sight mr western no sooner beheld than all his rage forsook him he roared for help with his utmost violence ran first to his daughter then back to the door calling for water and then back again to sophia never considering in whose arms she then was nor perhaps once recollecting that there was such a person in the world as jones for indeed i believe the present circumstances of his daughter were now the sole consideration which employed his thoughts
mrs western and a great number of servants soon came to the assistance of sophia with water cordials and everything necessary on those occasions
these were applied with such success that sophia in a very few minutes began to recover and all the symptoms of life to return
upon which she was presently led off by her own maid and mrs western nor did that good lady depart without leaving some wholesome admonitions with her brother on the dreadful effects of his passion or as she pleased to call it madness
the squire perhaps did not understand this good advice as it was delivered in obscure hints shrugs and notes of admiration at least if he did understand it he profited very little by it for no sooner was he cured of his immediate fears for his daughter than he relapsed into his former frenzy which must have produced an immediate battle with jones had not parson supple who was a very strong man been present and by mere force restrained the squire from acts of hostility
the moment sophia was departed jones advanced in a very suppliant manner to mr western whom the parson held in his arms and begged him to be pacified for that while he continued in such a passion it would be impossible to give him any satisfaction
i wull have satisfaction o' thee answered the squire so doff thy clothes
at unt half a man and i'll lick thee as well as wast ever licked in thy life he then bespattered the youth with abundance of that language which passes between country gentlemen who embrace opposite sides of the question with frequent applications to him to salute that part which is generally introduced into all controversies that arise among the lower orders of the english gentry at horseraces cockmatches and other public places
allusions to this part are likewise often made for the sake of the jest
and here i believe the wit is generally misunderstood
in reality it lies in desiring another to kiss your a for having just before threatened to kick his for i have observed very accurately that no one ever desires you to kick that which belongs to himself nor offers to kiss this part in another
it may likewise seem surprizing that in the many thousand kind invitations of this sort which every one who hath conversed with country gentlemen must have heard no one i believe hath ever seen a single instance where the desire hath been complied witha great instance of their want of politeness for in town nothing can be more common than for the finest gentlemen to perform this ceremony every day to their superiors without having that favour once requested of them
to all such wit jones very calmly answered sir this usage may perhaps cancel every other obligation you have conferred on me but there is one you can never cancel nor will i be provoked by your abuse to lift my hand against the father of sophia  at these words the squire grew still more outrageous than before so that the parson begged jones to retire saying you behold sir how he waxeth wrath at your abode here therefore let me pray you not to tarry any longer
his anger is too much kindled for you to commune with him at present
you had better therefore conclude your visit and refer what matters you have to urge in your behalf to some other opportunity  jones accepted this advice with thanks and immediately departed
the squire now regained the liberty of his hands and so much temper as to express some satisfaction in the restraint which had been laid upon him declaring that he should certainly have beat his brains out and adding it would have vexed one confoundedly to have been hanged for such a rascal  the parson now began to triumph in the success of his peacemaking endeavours and proceeded to read a lecture against anger which might perhaps rather have tended to raise than to quiet that passion in some hasty minds
this lecture he enriched with many valuable quotations from the antients particularly from seneca who hath indeed so well handled this passion that none but a very angry man can read him without great pleasure and profit
the doctor concluded this harangue with the famous story of alexander and clitus but as i find that entered in my commonplace under title drunkenness i shall not insert it here
the squire took no notice of this story nor perhaps of anything he said for he interrupted him before he had finished by calling for a tankard of beer observing which is perhaps as true as any observation on this fever of the mind that anger makes a man dry
no sooner had the squire swallowed a large draught than he renewed the discourse on jones and declared a resolution of going the next morning early to acquaint mr allworthy
his friend would have dissuaded him from this from the mere motive of goodnature but his dissuasion had no other effect than to produce a large volley of oaths and curses which greatly shocked the pious ears of supple but he did not dare to remonstrate against a privilege which the squire claimed as a freeborn englishman
to say truth the parson submitted to please his palate at the squire's table at the expense of suffering now and then this violence to his ears
he contented himself with thinking he did not promote this evil practice and that the squire would not swear an oath the less if he never entered within his gates
however though he was not guilty of ill manners by rebuking a gentleman in his own house he paid him off obliquely in the pulpit which had not indeed the good effect of working a reformation in the squire himself yet it so far operated on his conscience that he put the laws very severely in execution against others and the magistrate was the only person in the parish who could swear with impunity
chapter x
in which mr western visits mr allworthy
mr allworthy was now retired from breakfast with his nephew well satisfied with the report of the young gentleman's successful visit to sophia for he greatly desired the match more on account of the young lady's character than of her riches when mr western broke abruptly in upon them and without any ceremony began as follows  there you have done a fine piece of work truly
you have brought up your bastard to a fine purpose not that i believe you have had any hand in it neither that is as a man may say designedly but there is a fine kettleoffish made on't up at our house what can be the matter mr western said allworthy
o matter enow of all conscience my daughter hath fallen in love with your bastard that's all but i won't ge her a hapeny not the twentieth part of a brass varden
i always thought what would come o' breeding up a bastard like a gentleman and letting un come about to vok's houses
it's well vor un i could not get at un i'd a lick'd un i'd a spoil'd his caterwauling i'd a taught the son of a whore to meddle with meat for his master
he shan't ever have a morsel of meat of mine or a varden to buy it if she will ha un one smock shall be her portion
i'd sooner ge my esteate to the zinking fund that it may be sent to hanover to corrupt our nation with i am heartily sorry cries allworthy
pox o' your sorrow says western it will do me abundance of good when i have lost my only child my poor sophy that was the joy of my heart and all the hope and comfort of my age but i am resolved i will turn her out o' doors she shall beg and starve and rot in the streets
not one hapeny not a hapeny shall she ever hae o' mine
the son of a bitch was always good at finding a hare sitting an be rotted to'n i little thought what puss he was looking after but it shall be the worst he ever vound in his life
she shall be no better than carrion the skin o'er is all he shall ha and zu you may tell un i am in amazement cries allworthy at what you tell me after what passed between my nephew and the young lady no longer ago than yesterday yes sir answered western it was after what passed between your nephew and she that the whole matter came out
mr blifil there was no sooner gone than the son of a whore came lurching about the house
little did i think when i used to love him for a sportsman that he was all the while a poaching after my daughter why truly says allworthy i could wish you had not given him so many opportunities with her and you will do me the justice to acknowledge that i have always been averse to his staying so much at your house though i own i had no suspicion of this kind  why zounds cries western who could have thought it
what the devil had she to do wi'n
he did not come there a courting to her he came there a hunting with me but was it possible says allworthy that you should never discern any symptoms of love between them when you have seen them so often together never in my life as i hope to be saved cries western i never so much as zeed him kiss her in all my life and so far from courting her he used rather to be more silent when she was in company than at any other time and as for the girl she was always less civil to'n than to any young man that came to the house
as to that matter i am not more easy to be deceived than another i would not have you think i am neighbour allworthy could scarce refrain laughter at this but he resolved to do a violence to himself for he perfectly well knew mankind and had too much goodbreeding and goodnature to offend the squire in his present circumstances
he then asked western what he would have him do upon this occasion
to which the other answered that he would have him keep the rascal away from his house and that he would go and lock up the wench for he was resolved to make her marry mr blifil in spite of her teeth he then shook blifil by the hand and swore he would have no other soninlaw
presently after which he took his leave saying his house was in such disorder that it was necessary for him to make haste home to take care his daughter did not give him the slip and as for jones he swore if he caught him at his house he would qualify him to run for the geldings' plate
when allworthy and blifil were again left together a long silence ensued between them all which interval the young gentleman filled up with sighs which proceeded partly from disappointment but more from hatred for the success of jones was much more grievous to him than the loss of sophia
at length his uncle asked him what he was determined to do and he answered in the following wordsalas
sir can it be a question what step a lover will take when reason and passion point different ways
i am afraid it is too certain he will in that dilemma always follow the latter
reason dictates to me to quit all thoughts of a woman who places her affections on another my passion bids me hope she may in time change her inclinations in my favour
here however i conceive an objection may be raised which if it could not fully be answered would totally deter me from any further pursuit
i mean the injustice of endeavouring to supplant another in a heart of which he seems already in possession but the determined resolution of mr western shows that in this case i shall by so doing promote the happiness of every party not only that of the parent who will thus be preserved from the highest degree of misery but of both the others who must be undone by this match
the lady i am sure will be undone in every sense for besides the loss of most part of her own fortune she will be not only married to a beggar but the little fortune which her father cannot withhold from her will be squandered on that wench with whom i know he yet converses
nay that is a trifle for i know him to be one of the worst men in the world for had my dear uncle known what i have hitherto endeavoured to conceal he must have long since abandoned so profligate a wretch how said allworthy hath he done anything worse than i already know
tell me i beseech you no replied blifil it is now past and perhaps he may have repented of it i command you on your duty said allworthy to tell me what you mean you know sir says blifil i never disobeyed you but i am sorry i mentioned it since it may now look like revenge whereas i thank heaven no such motive ever entered my heart and if you oblige me to discover it i must be his petitioner to you for your forgiveness i will have no conditions  answered allworthy i think i have shown tenderness enough towards him and more perhaps than you ought to thank me for more indeed i fear than he deserved cries blifil for in the very day of your utmost danger when myself and all the family were in tears he filled the house with riot and debauchery
he drank and sung and roared and when i gave him a gentle hint of the indecency of his actions he fell into a violent passion swore many oaths called me rascal and struck me how cries allworthy did he dare to strike you i am sure cries blifil i have forgiven him that long ago
i wish i could so easily forget his ingratitude to the best of benefactors and yet even that i hope you will forgive him since he must have certainly been possessed with the devil for that very evening as mr thwackum and myself were taking the air in the fields and exulting in the good symptoms which then first began to discover themselves we unluckily saw him engaged with a wench in a manner not fit to be mentioned
mr thwackum with more boldness than prudence advanced to rebuke him when i am sorry to say it he fell upon the worthy man and beat him so outrageously that i wish he may have yet recovered the bruises
nor was i without my share of the effects of his malice while i endeavoured to protect my tutor but that i have long forgiven nay i prevailed with mr thwackum to forgive him too and not to inform you of a secret which i feared might be fatal to him
and now sir since i have unadvisedly dropped a hint of this matter and your commands have obliged me to discover the whole let me intercede with you for him o child said allworthy i know not whether i should blame or applaud your goodness in concealing such villany a moment but where is mr thwackum
not that i want any confirmation of what you say but i will examine all the evidence of this matter to justify to the world the example i am resolved to make of such a monster  thwackum was now sent for and presently appeared
he corroborated every circumstance which the other had deposed nay he produced the record upon his breast where the handwriting of mr jones remained very legible in black and blue
he concluded with declaring to mr allworthy that he should have long since informed him of this matter had not mr blifil by the most earnest interpositions prevented him
he is says he an excellent youth though such forgiveness of enemies is carrying the matter too far  in reality blifil had taken some pains to prevail with the parson and to prevent the discovery at that time for which he had many reasons
he knew that the minds of men are apt to be softened and relaxed from their usual severity by sickness
besides he imagined that if the story was told when the fact was so recent and the physician about the house who might have unravelled the real truth he should never be able to give it the malicious turn which he intended
again he resolved to hoard up this business till the indiscretion of jones should afford some additional complaints for he thought the joint weight of many facts falling upon him together would be the most likely to crush him and he watched therefore some such opportunity as that with which fortune had now kindly presented him
lastly by prevailing with thwackum to conceal the matter for a time he knew he should confirm an opinion of his friendship to jones which he had greatly laboured to establish in mr allworthy
chapter xi
a short chapter but which contains sufficient matter to affect the goodnatured reader
it was mr allworthy's custom never to punish any one not even to turn away a servant in a passion
he resolved therefore to delay passing sentence on jones till the afternoon
the poor young man attended at dinner as usual but his heart was too much loaded to suffer him to eat
his grief too was a good deal aggravated by the unkind looks of mr allworthy whence he concluded that western had discovered the whole affair between him and sophia but as to mr blifil's story he had not the least apprehension for of much the greater part he was entirely innocent and for the residue as he had forgiven and forgotten it himself so he suspected no remembrance on the other side
when dinner was over and the servants departed mr allworthy began to harangue
he set forth in a long speech the many iniquities of which jones had been guilty particularly those which this day had brought to light and concluded by telling him that unless he could clear himself of the charge he was resolved to banish him his sight for ever  many disadvantages attended poor jones in making his defence nay indeed he hardly knew his accusation for as mr allworthy in recounting the drunkenness c while he lay ill out of modesty sunk everything that related particularly to himself which indeed principally constituted the crime jones could not deny the charge
his heart was besides almost broken already and his spirits were so sunk that he could say nothing for himself but acknowledged the whole and like a criminal in despair threw himself upon mercy concluding that though he must own himself guilty of many follies and inadvertencies he hoped he had done nothing to deserve what would be to him the greatest punishment in the world  allworthy answered that he had forgiven him too often already in compassion to his youth and in hopes of his amendment that he now found he was an abandoned reprobate and such as it would be criminal in any one to support and encourage
nay said mr allworthy to him your audacious attempt to steal away the young lady calls upon me to justify my own character in punishing you
the world who have already censured the regard i have shown for you may think with some colour at least of justice that i connive at so base and barbarous an actionan action of which you must have known my abhorrence and which had you had any concern for my ease and honour as well as for my friendship you would never have thought of undertaking
fie upon it young man
indeed there is scarce any punishment equal to your crimes and i can scarce think myself justifiable in what i am now going to bestow on you
however as i have educated you like a child of my own i will not turn you naked into the world
when you open this paper therefore you will find something which may enable you with industry to get an honest livelihood but if you employ it to worse purposes i shall not think myself obliged to supply you farther being resolved from this day forward to converse no more with you on any account
i cannot avoid saying there is no part of your conduct which i resent more than your illtreatment of that good young man meaning blifil who hath behaved with so much tenderness and honour towards you  these last words were a dose almost too bitter to be swallowed
a flood of tears now gushed from the eyes of jones and every faculty of speech and motion seemed to have deserted him
it was some time before he was able to obey allworthy's peremptory commands of departing which he at length did having first kissed his hands with a passion difficult to be affected and as difficult to be described
the reader must be very weak if when he considers the light in which jones then appeared to mr allworthy he should blame the rigour of his sentence
and yet all the neighbourhood either from this weakness or from some worse motive condemned this justice and severity as the highest cruelty
nay the very persons who had before censured the good man for the kindness and tenderness shown to a bastard his own according to the general opinion now cried out as loudly against turning his own child out of doors
the women especially were unanimous in taking the part of jones and raised more stories on the occasion than i have room in this chapter to set down
one thing must not be omitted that in their censures on this occasion none ever mentioned the sum contained in the paper which allworthy gave jones which was no less than five hundred pounds but all agreed that he was sent away penniless and some said naked from the house of his inhuman father
chapter xii
containing loveletters c   jones was commanded to leave the house immediately and told that his clothes and everything else should be sent to him whithersoever he should order them
he accordingly set out and walked above a mile not regarding and indeed scarce knowing whither he went
at length a little brook obstructing his passage he threw himself down by the side of it nor could he help muttering with some little indignation sure my father will not deny me this place to rest in  here he presently fell into the most violent agonies tearing his hair from his head and using most other actions which generally accompany fits of madness rage and despair
when he had in this manner vented the first emotions of passion he began to come a little to himself
his grief now took another turn and discharged itself in a gentler way till he became at last cool enough to reason with his passion and to consider what steps were proper to be taken in his deplorable condition
and now the great doubt was how to act with regard to sophia
the thoughts of leaving her almost rent his heart asunder but the consideration of reducing her to ruin and beggary still racked him if possible more and if the violent desire of possessing her person could have induced him to listen one moment to this alternative still he was by no means certain of her resolution to indulge his wishes at so high an expense
the resentment of mr allworthy and the injury he must do to his quiet argued strongly against this latter and lastly the apparent impossibility of his success even if he would sacrifice all these considerations to it came to his assistance and thus honour at last backed with despair with gratitude to his benefactor and with real love to his mistress got the better of burning desire and he resolved rather to quit sophia than pursue her to her ruin
it is difficult for any who have not felt it to conceive the glowing warmth which filled his breast on the first contemplation of this victory over his passion
pride flattered him so agreeably that his mind perhaps enjoyed perfect happiness but this was only momentary sophia soon returned to his imagination and allayed the joy of his triumph with no less bitter pangs than a goodnatured general must feel when he surveys the bleeding heaps at the price of whose blood he hath purchased his laurels for thousands of tender ideas lay murdered before our conqueror
being resolved however to pursue the paths of this giant honour as the gigantic poet lee calls it he determined to write a farewel letter to sophia and accordingly proceeded to a house not far off where being furnished with proper materials he wrote as follows    madam    when you reflect on the situation in which i write i am sure your   goodnature will pardon any inconsistency or absurdity which my   letter contains for everything here flows from a heart so full   that no language can express its dictates
i have resolved madam to obey your commands in flying for ever   from your dear your lovely sight
cruel indeed those commands are   but it is a cruelty which proceeds from fortune not from my sophia
fortune hath made it necessary necessary to your preservation to   forget there ever was such a wretch as i am
believe me i would not hint all my sufferings to you if i   imagined they could possibly escape your ears
i know the goodness   and tenderness of your heart and would avoid giving you any of   those pains which you always feel for the miserable
o let nothing   which you shall hear of my hard fortune cause a moment's concern   for after the loss of you everything is to me a trifle
o sophia
it is hard to leave you it is harder still to desire you   to forget me yet the sincerest love obliges me to both
pardon my   conceiving that any remembrance of me can give you disquiet but if   i am so gloriously wretched sacrifice me every way to your relief
think i never loved you or think truly how little i deserve you   and learn to scorn me for a presumption which can never be too   severely punishedi am unable to say moremay guardian angels   protect you for ever  he was now searching his pockets for his wax but found none nor indeed anything else therein for in truth he had in his frantic disposition tossed everything from him and amongst the rest his pocketbook which he had received from mr allworthy which he had never opened and which now first occurred to his memory
the house supplied him with a wafer for his present purpose with which having sealed his letter he returned hastily towards the brook side in order to search for the things which he had there lost
in his way he met his old friend black george who heartily condoled with him on his misfortune for this had already reached his ears and indeed those of all the neighbourhood
jones acquainted the gamekeeper with his loss and he as readily went back with him to the brook where they searched every tuft of grass in the meadow as well where jones had not been as where he had been but all to no purpose for they found nothing for indeed though the things were then in the meadow they omitted to search the only place where they were deposited to wit in the pockets of the said george for he had just before found them and being luckily apprized of their value had very carefully put them up for his own use
the gamekeeper having exerted as much diligence in quest of the lost goods as if he had hoped to find them desired mr jones to recollect if he had been in no other place for sure said he if you had lost them here so lately the things must have been here still for this is a very unlikely place for any one to pass by and indeed it was by great accident that he himself had passed through that field in order to lay wires for hares with which he was to supply a poulterer at bath the next morning
jones now gave over all hopes of recovering his loss and almost all thoughts concerning it and turning to black george asked him earnestly if he would do him the greatest favour in the world
george answered with some hesitation sir you know you may command me whatever is in my power and i heartily wish it was in my power to do you any service in fact the question staggered him for he had by selling game amassed a pretty good sum of money in mr western's service and was afraid that jones wanted to borrow some small matter of him but he was presently relieved from his anxiety by being desired to convey a letter to sophia which with great pleasure he promised to do
and indeed i believe there are few favours which he would not have gladly conferred on mr jones for he bore as much gratitude towards him as he could and was as honest as men who love money better than any other thing in the universe generally are
mrs honour was agreed by both to be the proper means by which this letter should pass to sophia
they then separated the gamekeeper returned home to mr western's and jones walked to an alehouse at half a mile's distance to wait for his messenger's return
george no sooner came home to his master's house than he met with mrs honour to whom having first sounded her with a few previous questions he delivered the letter for her mistress and received at the same time another from her for mr jones which honour told him she had carried all that day in her bosom and began to despair of finding any means of delivering it
the gamekeeper returned hastily and joyfully to jones who having received sophia's letter from him instantly withdrew and eagerly breaking it open read as follows    sir    it is impossible to express what i have felt since i saw you
your   submitting on my account to such cruel insults from my father   lays me under an obligation i shall ever own
as you know his   temper i beg you will for my sake avoid him
i wish i had any   comfort to send you but believe this that nothing but the last   violence shall ever give my hand or heart where you would be sorry   to see them bestowed  jones read this letter a hundred times over and kissed it a hundred times as often
his passion now brought all tender desires back into his mind
he repented that he had writ to sophia in the manner we have seen above but he repented more that he had made use of the interval of his messenger's absence to write and dispatch a letter to mr allworthy in which he had faithfully promised and bound himself to quit all thoughts of his love
however when his cool reflections returned he plainly perceived that his case was neither mended nor altered by sophia's billet unless to give him some little glimpse of hope from her constancy of some favourable accident hereafter
he therefore resumed his resolution and taking leave of black george set forward to a town about five miles distant whither he had desired mr allworthy unless he pleased to revoke his sentence to send his things after him
chapter xiii
the behaviour of sophia on the present occasion which none of her sex will blame who are capable of behaving in the same manner
and the discussion of a knotty point in the court of conscience
sophia had passed the last twentyfour hours in no very desirable manner
during a large part of them she had been entertained by her aunt with lectures of prudence recommending to her the example of the polite world where love so the good lady said is at present entirely laughed at and where women consider matrimony as men do offices of public trust only as the means of making their fortunes and of advancing themselves in the world
in commenting on which text mrs western had displayed her eloquence during several hours
these sagacious lectures though little suited either to the taste or inclination of sophia were however less irksome to her than her own thoughts that formed the entertainment of the night during which she never once closed her eyes
but though she could neither sleep nor rest in her bed yet having no avocation from it she was found there by her father at his return from allworthy's which was not till past ten o'clock in the morning
he went directly up to her apartment opened the door and seeing she was not up cried oh
you are safe then and i am resolved to keep you so he then locked the door and delivered the key to honour having first given her the strictest charge with great promises of rewards for her fidelity and most dreadful menaces of punishment in case she should betray her trust
honour's orders were not to suffer her mistress to come out of her room without the authority of the squire himself and to admit none to her but him and her aunt but she was herself to attend her with whatever sophia pleased except only pen ink and paper of which she was forbidden the use
the squire ordered his daughter to dress herself and attend him at dinner which she obeyed and having sat the usual time was again conducted to her prison
in the evening the gaoler honour brought her the letter which she received from the gamekeeper
sophia read it very attentively twice or thrice over and then threw herself upon the bed and burst into a flood of tears
mrs honour expressed great astonishment at this behaviour in her mistress nor could she forbear very eagerly begging to know the cause of this passion
sophia made her no answer for some time and then starting suddenly up caught her maid by the hand and cried o honour
i am undone marry forbid cries honour i wish the letter had been burnt before i had brought it to your la'ship
i'm sure i thought it would have comforted your la'ship or i would have seen it at the devil before i would have touched it honour says sophia you are a good girl and it is vain to attempt concealing longer my weakness from you i have thrown away my heart on a man who hath forsaken me and is mr jones answered the maid such a perfidy man he hath taken his leave of me says sophia for ever in that letter
nay he hath desired me to forget him
could he have desired that if he had loved me
could he have borne such a thought
could he have written such a word no certainly ma'am cries honour and to be sure if the best man in england was to desire me to forget him i'd take him at his word
marry come up
i am sure your la'ship hath done him too much honour ever to think on hima young lady who may take her choice of all the young men in the country
and to be sure if i may be so presumptuous as to offer my poor opinion there is young mr blifil who besides that he is come of honest parents and will be one of the greatest squires all hereabouts he is to be sure in my poor opinion a more handsomer and a more politer man by half and besides he is a young gentleman of a sober character and who may defy any of the neighbours to say black is his eye he follows no dirty trollops nor can any bastards be laid at his door
forget him indeed
i thank heaven i myself am not so much at my last prayers as to suffer any man to bid me forget him twice
if the best he that wears a head was for to go for to offer to say such an affronting word to me i would never give him my company afterwards if there was another young man in the kingdom
and as i was a saying to be sure there is young mr blifil name not his detested name cries sophia
nay ma'am says honour if your la'ship doth not like him there be more jolly handsome young men that would court your la'ship if they had but the least encouragement
i don't believe there is arrow young gentleman in this county or in the next to it that if your la'ship was but to look as if you had a mind to him would not come about to make his offers directly what a wretch dost thou imagine me cries sophia by affronting my ears with such stuff
i detest all mankind nay to be sure ma'am  answered honour your la'ship hath had enough to give you a surfeit of them
to be used ill by such a poor beggarly bastardly fellowhold your blasphemous tongue cries sophia how dare you mention his name with disrespect before me
he use me ill
no his poor bleeding heart suffered more when he writ the cruel words than mine from reading them
o
he is all heroic virtue and angelic goodness
i am ashamed of the weakness of my own passion for blaming what i ought to admire
o honour
it is my good only which he consults
to my interest he sacrifices both himself and me
the apprehension of ruining me hath driven him to despair i am very glad says honour to hear your la'ship takes that into your consideration for to be sure it must be nothing less than ruin to give your mind to one that is turned out of doors and is not worth a farthing in the world turned out of doors cries sophia hastily how
what dost thou mean why to be sure ma'am my master no sooner told squire allworthy about mr jones having offered to make love to your la'ship than the squire stripped him stark naked and turned him out of doors ha says sophia i have been the cursed wretched cause of his destruction
turned naked out of doors
here honour take all the money i have take the rings from my fingers
here my watch carry him all
go find him immediately for heaven's sake ma'am answered mrs honour do but consider if my master should miss any of these things i should be made to answer for them
therefore let me beg your la'ship not to part with your watch and jewels
besides the money i think is enough of all conscience and as for that my master can never know anything of the matter here then cries sophia take every farthing i am worth find him out immediately and give it him
go go lose not a moment  mrs honour departed according to orders and finding black george belowstairs delivered him the purse which contained sixteen guineas being indeed the whole stock of sophia for though her father was very liberal to her she was much too generous to be rich
black george having received the purse set forward towards the alehouse but in the way a thought occurred to him whether he should not detain this money likewise
his conscience however immediately started at this suggestion and began to upbraid him with ingratitude to his benefactor
to this his avarice answered that his conscience should have considered the matter before when he deprived poor jones of his 
that having quietly acquiesced in what was of so much greater importance it was absurd if not downright hypocrisy to affect any qualms at this trifle
in return to which conscience like a good lawyer attempted to distinguish between an absolute breach of trust as here where the goods were delivered and a bare concealment of what was found as in the former case
avarice presently treated this with ridicule called it a distinction without a difference and absolutely insisted that when once all pretensions of honour and virtue were given up in any one instance that there was no precedent for resorting to them upon a second occasion
in short poor conscience had certainly been defeated in the argument had not fear stept in to her assistance and very strenuously urged that the real distinction between the two actions did not lie in the different degrees of honour but of safety for that the secreting the  was a matter of very little hazard whereas the detaining the sixteen guineas was liable to the utmost danger of discovery
by this friendly aid of fear conscience obtained a compleat victory in the mind of black george and after making him a few compliments on his honesty forced him to deliver the money to jones
chapter xiv
a short chapter containing a short dialogue between squire western and his sister
mrs western had been engaged abroad all that day
the squire met her at her return home and when she enquired after sophia he acquainted her that he had secured her safe enough
she is locked up in chamber cries he and honour keeps the key as his looks were full of prodigious wisdom and sagacity when he gave his sister this information it is probable he expected much applause from her for what he had done but how was he disappointed when with a most disdainful aspect she cried sure brother you are the weakest of all men
why will you not confide in me for the management of my niece
why will you interpose
you have now undone all that i have been spending my breath in order to bring about
while i have been endeavouring to fill her mind with maxims of prudence you have been provoking her to reject them
english women brother i thank heaven are no slaves
we are not to be locked up like the spanish and italian wives
we have as good a right to liberty as yourselves
we are to be convinced by reason and persuasion only and not governed by force
i have seen the world brother and know what arguments to make use of and if your folly had not prevented me should have prevailed with her to form her conduct by those rules of prudence and discretion which i formerly taught her to be sure said the squire i am always in the wrong brother answered the lady you are not in the wrong unless when you meddle with matters beyond your knowledge
you must agree that i have seen most of the world and happy had it been for my niece if she had not been taken from under my care
it is by living at home with you that she hath learnt romantic notions of love and nonsense you don't imagine i hope cries the squire that i have taught her any such things your ignorance brother returned she as the great milton says almost subdues my patience dn milton answered the squire if he had the impudence to say so to my face i'd lend him a douse thof he was never so great a man
patience
an you come to that sister i have more occasion of patience to be used like an overgrown schoolboy as i am by you
do you think no one hath any understanding unless he hath been about at court
pox
the world is come to a fine pass indeed if we are all fools except a parcel of roundheads and hanover rats
pox
i hope the times are a coming when we shall make fools of them and every man shall enjoy his own
that's all sister and every man shall enjoy his own
i hope to zee it sister before the hanover rats have eat up all our corn and left us nothing but turneps to feed uponi protest brother cries she you are now got beyond my understanding
your jargon of turneps and hanover rats is to me perfectly unintelligiblei believe cries he you don't care to hear o'em but the country interest may succeed one day or other for all thati wish answered the lady you would think a little of your daughter's interest for believe me she is in greater danger than the nationjust now said he you chid me for thinking on her and would ha' her left to youand if you will promise to interpose no more answered she i will out of my regard to my niece undertake the chargewell do then said the squire for you know i always agreed that women are the properest to manage women     the reader may perhaps subdue his own patience if he searches   for this in milton
mrs western then departed muttering something with an air of disdain concerning women and management of the nation
she immediately repaired to sophia's apartment who was now after a day's confinement released again from her captivity

chapter i
a comparison between the world and the stage
the world hath been often compared to the theatre and many grave writers as well as the poets have considered human life as a great drama resembling in almost every particular those scenical representations which thespis is first reported to have invented and which have been since received with so much approbation and delight in all polite countries
this thought hath been carried so far and is become so general that some words proper to the theatre and which were at first metaphorically applied to the world are now indiscriminately and literally spoken of both thus stage and scene are by common use grown as familiar to us when we speak of life in general as when we confine ourselves to dramatic performances and when transactions behind the curtain are mentioned st james's is more likely to occur to our thoughts than drurylane
it may seem easy enough to account for all this by reflecting that the theatrical stage is nothing more than a representation or as aristotle calls it an imitation of what really exists and hence perhaps we might fairly pay a very high compliment to those who by their writings or actions have been so capable of imitating life as to have their pictures in a manner confounded with or mistaken for the originals
but in reality we are not so fond of paying compliments to these people whom we use as children frequently do the instruments of their amusement and have much more pleasure in hissing and buffeting them than in admiring their excellence
there are many other reasons which have induced us to see this analogy between the world and the stage
some have considered the larger part of mankind in the light of actors as personating characters no more their own and to which in fact they have no better title than the player hath to be in earnest thought the king or emperor whom he represents
thus the hypocrite may be said to be a player and indeed the greeks called them both by one and the same name
the brevity of life hath likewise given occasion to this comparison
so the immortal shakespear        life's a poor player       that struts and frets his hour upon the stage       and then is heard no more
for which hackneyed quotation i will make the reader amends by a very noble one which few i believe have read
it is taken from a poem called the deity published about nine years ago and long since buried in oblivion a proof that good books no more than good men do always survive the bad
from thee all human actions take their springs       the rise of empires and the fall of kings
see the vast theatre of time display'd       while o'er the scene succeeding heroes tread
with pomp the shining images succeed       what leaders triumph and what monarchs bleed
perform the parts thy providence assign'd       their pride their passions to thy ends inclin'd       awhile they glitter in the face of day       then at thy nod the phantoms pass away       no traces left of all the busy scene       but that remembrance saysthe things have been     the deity
in all these however and in every other similitude of life to the theatre the resemblance hath been always taken from the stage only
none as i remember have at all considered the audience at this great drama
but as nature often exhibits some of her best performances to a very full house so will the behaviour of her spectators no less admit the abovementioned comparison than that of her actors
in this vast theatre of time are seated the friend and the critic here are claps and shouts hisses and groans in short everything which was ever seen or heard at the theatreroyal
let us examine this in one example for instance in the behaviour of the great audience on that scene which nature was pleased to exhibit in the twelfth chapter of the preceding book where she introduced black george running away with the  from his friend and benefactor
those who sat in the world's upper gallery treated that incident i am well convinced with their usual vociferation and every term of scurrilous reproach was most probably vented on that occasion
if we had descended to the next order of spectators we should have found an equal degree of abhorrence though less of noise and scurrility yet here the good women gave black george to the devil and many of them expected every minute that the clovenfooted gentleman would fetch his own
the pit as usual was no doubt divided those who delight in heroic virtue and perfect character objected to the producing such instances of villany without punishing them very severely for the sake of example
some of the author's friends cryed look'e gentlemen the man is a villain but it is nature for all that and all the young critics of the age the clerks apprentices c called it low and fell a groaning
as for the boxes they behaved with their accustomed politeness
most of them were attending to something else
some of those few who regarded the scene at all declared he was a bad kind of man while others refused to give their opinion till they had heard that of the best judges
now we who are admitted behind the scenes of this great theatre of nature and no author ought to write anything besides dictionaries and spellingbooks who hath not this privilege can censure the action without conceiving any absolute detestation of the person whom perhaps nature may not have designed to act an ill part in all her dramas for in this instance life most exactly resembles the stage since it is often the same person who represents the villain and the heroe and he who engages your admiration today will probably attract your contempt tomorrow
as garrick whom i regard in tragedy to be the greatest genius the world hath ever produced sometimes condescends to play the fool so did scipio the great and laelius the wise according to horace many years ago nay cicero reports them to have been incredibly childish these it is true played the fool like my friend garrick in jest only but several eminent characters have in numberless instances of their lives played the fool egregiously in earnest so far as to render it a matter of some doubt whether their wisdom or folly was predominant or whether they were better intitled to the applause or censure the admiration or contempt the love or hatred of mankind
those persons indeed who have passed any time behind the scenes of this great theatre and are thoroughly acquainted not only with the several disguises which are there put on but also with the fantastic and capricious behaviour of the passions who are the managers and directors of this theatre for as to reason the patentee he is known to be a very idle fellow and seldom to exert himself may most probably have learned to understand the famous nil admirari of horace or in the english phrase to stare at nothing
a single bad act no more constitutes a villain in life than a single bad part on the stage
the passions like the managers of a playhouse often force men upon parts without consulting their judgment and sometimes without any regard to their talents
thus the man as well as the player may condemn what he himself acts nay it is common to see vice sit as awkwardly on some men as the character of iago would on the honest face of mr william mills
upon the whole then the man of candour and of true understanding is never hasty to condemn
he can censure an imperfection or even a vice without rage against the guilty party
in a word they are the same folly the same childishness the same illbreeding and the same illnature which raise all the clamours and uproars both in life and on the stage
the worst of men generally have the words rogue and villain most in their mouths as the lowest of all wretches are the aptest to cry out low in the pit
chapter ii
containing a conversation which mr jones had with himself
jones received his effects from mr allworthy's early in the morning with the following answer to his letter    sir    i am commanded by my uncle to acquaint you that as he did not   proceed to those measures he had taken with you without the   greatest deliberation and after the fullest evidence of your   unworthiness so will it be always out of your power to cause the   least alteration in his resolution
he expresses great surprize at   your presumption in saying you have resigned all pretensions to a   young lady to whom it is impossible you should ever have had any   her birth and fortune having made her so infinitely your superior
lastly i am commanded to tell you that the only instance of your   compliance with my uncle's inclinations which he requires is your   immediately quitting this country
i cannot conclude this without   offering you my advice as a christian that you would seriously   think of amending your life
that you may be assisted with grace so   to do will be always the prayer of    your humble servant    w
blifil  many contending passions were raised in our heroe's mind by this letter but the tender prevailed at last over the indignant and irascible and a flood of tears came seasonably to his assistance and possibly prevented his misfortunes from either turning his head or bursting his heart
he grew however soon ashamed of indulging this remedy and starting up he cried well then i will give mr allworthy the only instance he requires of my obedience
i will go this momentbut whitherwhy let fortune direct since there is no other who thinks it of any consequence what becomes of this wretched person it shall be a matter of equal indifference to myself
shall i alone regard what no otherha
have i not reason to think there is anotherone whose value is above that of the whole worldi may i must imagine my sophia is not indifferent to what becomes of me
shall i then leave this only friendand such a friend
shall i not stay with herwherehow can i stay with her
have i any hopes of ever seeing her though she was as desirous as myself without exposing her to the wrath of her father and to what purpose
can i think of soliciting such a creature to consent to her own ruin
shall i indulge any passion of mine at such a price
shall i lurk about this country like a thief with such intentionsno i disdain i detest the thought
farewel sophia farewel most lovely most beloved here passion stopped his mouth and found a vent at his eyes
and now having taken a resolution to leave the country he began to debate with himself whither he should go
the world as milton phrases it lay all before him and jones no more than adam had any man to whom he might resort for comfort or assistance
all his acquaintance were the acquaintance of mr allworthy and he had no reason to expect any countenance from them as that gentleman had withdrawn his favour from him
men of great and good characters should indeed be very cautious how they discard their dependents for the consequence to the unhappy sufferer is being discarded by all others
what course of life to pursue or to what business to apply himself was a second consideration and here the prospect was all a melancholy void
every profession and every trade required length of time and what was worse money for matters are so constituted that nothing out of nothing is not a truer maxim in physics than in politics and every man who is greatly destitute of money is on that account entirely excluded from all means of acquiring it
at last the ocean that hospitable friend to the wretched opened her capacious arms to receive him and he instantly resolved to accept her kind invitation
to express myself less figuratively he determined to go to sea
this thought indeed no sooner suggested itself than he eagerly embraced it and having presently hired horses he set out for bristol to put it in execution
but before we attend him on this expedition we shall resort awhile to mr western's and see what further happened to the charming sophia
chapter iii
containing several dialogues
the morning in which mr jones departed mrs western summoned sophia into her apartment and having first acquainted her that she had obtained her liberty of her father she proceeded to read her a long lecture on the subject of matrimony which she treated not as a romantic scheme of happiness arising from love as it hath been described by the poets nor did she mention any of those purposes for which we are taught by divines to regard it as instituted by sacred authority she considered it rather as a fund in which prudent women deposit their fortunes to the best advantage in order to receive a larger interest for them than they could have elsewhere
when mrs western had finished sophia answered that she was very incapable of arguing with a lady of her aunt's superior knowledge and experience especially on a subject which she had so very little considered as this of matrimony  argue with me child replied the other i do not indeed expect it
i should have seen the world to very little purpose truly if i am to argue with one of your years
i have taken this trouble in order to instruct you
the antient philosophers such as socrates alcibiades and others did not use to argue with their scholars
you are to consider me child as socrates not asking your opinion but only informing you of mine from which last words the reader may possibly imagine that this lady had read no more of the philosophy of socrates than she had of that of alcibiades and indeed we cannot resolve his curiosity as to this point
madam cries sophia i have never presumed to controvert any opinion of yours and this subject as i said i have never yet thought of and perhaps never may  indeed sophy replied the aunt this dissimulation with me is very foolish
the french shall as soon persuade me that they take foreign towns in defence only of their own country as you can impose on me to believe you have never yet thought seriously of matrimony
how can you child affect to deny that you have considered of contracting an alliance when you so well know i am acquainted with the party with whom you desire to contract itan alliance as unnatural and contrary to your interest as a separate league with the french would be to the interest of the dutch
but however if you have not hitherto considered of this matter i promise you it is now high time for my brother is resolved immediately to conclude the treaty with mr blifil and indeed i am a sort of guarantee in the affair and have promised your concurrence  indeed madam cries sophia this is the only instance in which i must disobey both yourself and my father
for this is a match which requires very little consideration in me to refuse  if i was not as great a philosopher as socrates himself returned mrs western you would overcome my patience
what objection can you have to the young gentleman  a very solid objection in my opinion says sophiai hate him  will you never learn a proper use of words answered the aunt
indeed child you should consult bailey's dictionary
it is impossible you should hate a man from whom you have received no injury
by hatred therefore you mean no more than dislike which is no sufficient objection against your marrying of him
i have known many couples who have entirely disliked each other lead very comfortable genteel lives
believe me child i know these things better than you
you will allow me i think to have seen the world in which i have not an acquaintance who would not rather be thought to dislike her husband than to like him
the contrary is such outoffashion romantic nonsense that the very imagination of it is shocking  indeed madam replied sophia i shall never marry a man i dislike
if i promise my father never to consent to any marriage contrary to his inclinations i think i may hope he will never force me into that state contrary to my own  inclinations cries the aunt with some warmth
inclinations
i am astonished at your assurance
a young woman of your age and unmarried to talk of inclinations
but whatever your inclinations may be my brother is resolved nay since you talk of inclinations i shall advise him to hasten the treaty
inclinations  sophia then flung herself upon her knees and tears began to trickle from her shining eyes
she entreated her aunt to have mercy upon her and not to resent so cruelly her unwillingness to make herself miserable often urging that she alone was concerned and that her happiness only was at stake  as a bailiff when well authorized by his writ having possessed himself of the person of some unhappy debtor views all his tears without concern in vain the wretched captive attempts to raise compassion in vain the tender wife bereft of her companion the little prattling boy or frighted girl are mentioned as inducements to reluctance
the noble bumtrap blind and deaf to every circumstance of distress greatly rises above all the motives to humanity and into the hands of the gaoler resolves to deliver his miserable prey
not less blind to the tears or less deaf to every entreaty of sophia was the politic aunt nor less determined was she to deliver over the trembling maid into the arms of the gaoler blifil
she answered with great impetuosity so far madam from your being concerned alone your concern is the least or surely the least important
it is the honour of your family which is concerned in this alliance you are only the instrument
do you conceive mistress that in an intermarriage between kingdoms as when a daughter of france is married into spain the princess herself is alone considered in the match
no
it is a match between two kingdoms rather than between two persons
the same happens in great families such as ours
the alliance between the families is the principal matter
you ought to have a greater regard for the honour of your family than for your own person and if the example of a princess cannot inspire you with these noble thoughts you cannot surely complain at being used no worse than all princesses are used  i hope madam cries sophia with a little elevation of voice i shall never do anything to dishonour my family but as for mr blifil whatever may be the consequence i am resolved against him and no force shall prevail in his favour  western who had been within hearing during the greater part of the preceding dialogue had now exhausted all his patience he therefore entered the room in a violent passion crying dn me then if shatunt ha'un dn me if shatunt that's allthat's all dn me if shatunt  mrs western had collected a sufficient quantity of wrath for the use of sophia but she now transferred it all to the squire
brother  said she it is astonishing that you will interfere in a matter which you had totally left to my negotiation
regard to my family hath made me take upon myself to be the mediating power in order to rectify those mistakes in policy which you have committed in your daughter's education
for brother it is youit is your preposterous conduct which hath eradicated all the seeds that i had formerly sown in her tender mind
it is you yourself who have taught her disobedienceblood cries the squire foaming at the mouth you are enough to conquer the patience of the devil
have i ever taught my daughter disobediencehere she stands speak honestly girl did ever i bid you be disobedient to me
have not i done everything to humour and to gratify you and to make you obedient to me
and very obedient to me she was when a little child before you took her in hand and spoiled her by filling her head with a pack of court notions
whywhywhydid i not overhear you telling her she must behave like a princess
you have made a whig of the girl and how should her father or anybody else expect any obedience from herbrother answered mrs western with an air of great disdain i cannot express the contempt i have for your politics of all kinds but i will appeal likewise to the young lady herself whether i have ever taught her any principles of disobedience
on the contrary niece have i not endeavoured to inspire you with a true idea of the several relations in which a human creature stands in society
have i not taken infinite pains to show you that the law of nature hath enjoined a duty on children to their parents
have i not told you what plato says on that subjecta subject on which you was so notoriously ignorant when you came first under my care that i verily believe you did not know the relation between a daughter and a father'tis a lie answered western
the girl is no such fool as to live to eleven years old without knowing that she was her father's relationo
more than gothic ignorance answered the lady
and as for your manners brother i must tell you they deserve a canewhy then you may gi' it me if you think you are able cries the squire nay i suppose your niece there will be ready enough to help youbrother said mrs western though i despise you beyond expression yet i shall endure your insolence no longer so i desire my coach may be got ready immediately for i am resolved to leave your house this very morningand a good riddance too answered he i can bear your insolence no longer an you come to that
blood
it is almost enough of itself to make my daughter undervalue my sense when she hears you telling me every minute you despise meit is impossible it is impossible cries the aunt no one can undervalue such a boorboar answered the squire i am no boar no nor ass no nor rat neither madam
remember thati am no rat
i am a true englishman and not of your hanover breed that have eat up the nationthou art one of those wise men cries she whose nonsensical principles have undone the nation by weakening the hands of our government at home and by discouraging our friends and encouraging our enemies abroadho
are you come back to your politics cries the squire as for those i despise them as much as i do a ft which last words he accompanied and graced with the very action which of all others was the most proper to it
and whether it was this word or the contempt exprest for her politics which most affected mrs western i will not determine but she flew into the most violent rage uttered phrases improper to be here related and instantly burst out of the house
nor did her brother or her niece think proper either to stop or to follow her for the one was so much possessed by concern and the other by anger that they were rendered almost motionless
the squire however sent after his sister the same holloa which attends the departure of a hare when she is first started before the hounds
he was indeed a great master of this kind of vociferation and had a holla proper for most occasions in life
women who like mrs western know the world and have applied themselves to philosophy and politics would have immediately availed themselves of the present disposition of mr western's mind by throwing in a few artful compliments to his understanding at the expense of his absent adversary but poor sophia was all simplicity
by which word we do not intend to insinuate to the reader that she was silly which is generally understood as a synonymous term with simple for she was indeed a most sensible girl and her understanding was of the first rate but she wanted all that useful art which females convert to so many good purposes in life and which as it rather arises from the heart than from the head is often the property of the silliest of women
chapter iv
a picture of a country gentlewoman taken from the life
mr western having finished his holla and taken a little breath began to lament in very pathetic terms the unfortunate condition of men who are says he always whipt in by the humours of some dn'd b or other
i think i was hard run enough by your mother for one man but after giving her a dodge here's another b follows me upon the foil but curse my jacket if i will be run down in this manner by any o'um  sophia never had a single dispute with her father till this unlucky affair of blifil on any account except in defence of her mother whom she had loved most tenderly though she lost her in the eleventh year of her age
the squire to whom that poor woman had been a faithful upperservant all the time of their marriage had returned that behaviour by making what the world calls a good husband
he very seldom swore at her perhaps not above once a week and never beat her she had not the least occasion for jealousy and was perfect mistress of her time for she was never interrupted by her husband who was engaged all the morning in his field exercises and all the evening with bottle companions
she scarce indeed ever saw him but at meals where she had the pleasure of carving those dishes which she had before attended at the dressing
from these meals she retired about five minutes after the other servants having only stayed to drink the king over the water such were it seems mr western's orders for it was a maxim with him that women should come in with the first dish and go out after the first glass
obedience to these orders was perhaps no difficult task for the conversation if it may be called so was seldom such as could entertain a lady
it consisted chiefly of hallowing singing relations of sporting adventures bdy and abuse of women and of the government
these however were the only seasons when mr western saw his wife for when he repaired to her bed he was generally so drunk that he could not see and in the sporting season he always rose from her before it was light
thus was she perfect mistress of her time and had besides a coach and four usually at her command though unhappily indeed the badness of the neighbourhood and of the roads made this of little use for none who had set much value on their necks would have passed through the one or who had set any value on their hours would have visited the other
now to deal honestly with the reader she did not make all the return expected to so much indulgence for she had been married against her will by a fond father the match having been rather advantageous on her side for the squire's estate was upward of  a year and her fortune no more than a bare 
hence perhaps she had contracted a little gloominess of temper for she was rather a good servant than a good wife nor had she always the gratitude to return the extraordinary degree of roaring mirth with which the squire received her even with a goodhumoured smile
she would moreover sometimes interfere with matters which did not concern her as the violent drinking of her husband which in the gentlest terms she would take some of the few opportunities he gave her of remonstrating against
and once in her life she very earnestly entreated him to carry her for two months to london which he peremptorily denied nay was angry with his wife for the request ever after being well assured that all the husbands in london are cuckolds
for this last and many other good reasons western at length heartily hated his wife and as he never concealed this hatred before her death so he never forgot it afterwards but when anything in the least soured him as a bad scenting day or a distemper among his hounds or any other such misfortune he constantly vented his spleen by invectives against the deceased saying if my wife was alive now she would be glad of this  these invectives he was especially desirous of throwing forth before sophia for as he loved her more than he did any other so he was really jealous that she had loved her mother better than him
and this jealousy sophia seldom failed of heightening on these occasions for he was not contented with violating her ears with the abuse of her mother but endeavoured to force an explicit approbation of all this abuse with which desire he never could prevail upon her by any promise or threats to comply
hence some of my readers will perhaps wonder that the squire had not hated sophia as much as he had hated her mother but i must inform them that hatred is not the effect of love even through the medium of jealousy
it is indeed very possible for jealous persons to kill the objects of their jealousy but not to hate them
which sentiment being a pretty hard morsel and bearing something of the air of a paradox we shall leave the reader to chew the cud upon it to the end of the chapter
chapter v  the generous behaviour of sophia towards her aunt
sophia kept silence during the foregoing speech of her father nor did she once answer otherwise than with a sigh but as he understood none of the language or as he called it lingo of the eyes so he was not satisfied without some further approbation of his sentiments which he now demanded of his daughter telling her in the usual way he expected she was ready to take the part of everybody against him as she had always done that of the b her mother sophia remaining still silent he cryed out what art dumb
why dost unt speak
was not thy mother a dd b to me
answer me that
what i suppose you despise your father too and don't think him good enough to speak to  for heaven's sake sir answered sophia do not give so cruel a turn to my silence
i am sure i would sooner die than be guilty of any disrespect towards you but how can i venture to speak when every word must either offend my dear papa or convict me of the blackest ingratitude as well as impiety to the memory of the best of mothers for such i am certain my mamma was always to me  and your aunt i suppose is the best of sisters too replied the squire
will you be so kind as to allow that she is a b
i may fairly insist upon that i think  indeed sir says sophia i have great obligations to my aunt
she hath been a second mother to me  and a second wife to me too returned western so you will take her part too
you won't confess that she hath acted the part of the vilest sister in the world  upon my word sir cries sophia i must belie my heart wickedly if i did
i know my aunt and you differ very much in your ways of thinking but i have heard her a thousand times express the greatest affection for you and i am convinced so far from her being the worst sister in the world there are very few who love a brother better  the english of all which is answered the squire that i am in the wrong
ay certainly
ay to be sure the woman is in the right and the man in the wrong always  pardon me sir cries sophia
i do not say so  what don't you say answered the father you have the impudence to say she's in the right doth it not follow then of course that i am in the wrong
and perhaps i am in the wrong to suffer such a presbyterian hanoverian b to come into my house
she may 'dite me of a plot for anything i know and give my estate to the government  so far sir from injuring you or your estate says sophia if my aunt had died yesterday i am convinced she would have left you her whole fortune  whether sophia intended it or no i shall not presume to assert but certain it is these last words penetrated very deep into the ears of her father and produced a much more sensible effect than all she had said before
he received the sound with much the same action as a man receives a bullet in his head
he started staggered and turned pale
after which he remained silent above a minute and then began in the following hesitating manner yesterday
she would have left me her esteate yesterday
would she
why yesterday of all the days in the year
i suppose if she dies tomorrow she will leave it to somebody else and perhaps out of the vamilymy aunt sir cries sophia hath very violent passions and i can't answer what she may do under their influence  you can't returned the father and pray who hath been the occasion of putting her into those violent passions
nay who hath actually put her into them
was not you and she hard at it before i came into the room
besides was not all our quarrel about you
i have not quarrelled with sister this many years but upon your account and now you would throw the whole blame upon me as thof i should be the occasion of her leaving the esteate out o' the vamily
i could have expected no better indeed this is like the return you make to all the rest of my fondness  i beseech you then cries sophia upon my knees i beseech you if i have been the unhappy occasion of this difference that you will endeavour to make it up with my aunt and not suffer her to leave your house in this violent rage of anger she is a very goodnatured woman and a few civil words will satisfy her
let me entreat you sir  so i must go and ask pardon for your fault must i answered western
you have lost the hare and i must draw every way to find her again
indeed if i was certainhere he stopt and sophia throwing in more entreaties at length prevailed upon him so that after venting two or three bitter sarcastical expressions against his daughter he departed as fast as he could to recover his sister before her equipage could be gotten ready
sophia then returned to her chamber of mourning where she indulged herself if the phrase may be allowed me in all the luxury of tender grief
she read over more than once the letter which she had received from jones her muff too was used on this occasion and she bathed both these as well as herself with her tears
in this situation the friendly mrs honour exerted her utmost abilities to comfort her afflicted mistress
she ran over the names of many young gentlemen and having greatly commended their parts and persons assured sophia that she might take her choice of any
these methods must have certainly been used with some success in disorders of the like kind or so skilful a practitioner as mrs honour would never have ventured to apply them nay i have heard that the college of chambermaids hold them to be as sovereign remedies as any in the female dispensary but whether it was that sophia's disease differed inwardly from those cases with which it agreed in external symptoms i will not assert but in fact the good waitingwoman did more harm than good and at last so incensed her mistress which was no easy matter that with an angry voice she dismissed her from her presence
chapter vi
containing great variety of matter
the squire overtook his sister just as she was stepping into the coach and partly by force and partly by solicitations prevailed upon her to order her horses back into their quarters
he succeeded in this attempt without much difficulty for the lady was as we have already hinted of a most placable disposition and greatly loved her brother though she despised his parts or rather his little knowledge of the world
poor sophia who had first set on foot this reconciliation was now made the sacrifice to it
they both concurred in their censures on her conduct jointly declared war against her and directly proceeded to counsel how to carry it on in the most vigorous manner
for this purpose mrs western proposed not only an immediate conclusion of the treaty with allworthy but as immediately to carry it into execution saying that there was no other way to succeed with her niece but by violent methods which she was convinced sophia had not sufficient resolution to resist
by violent says she i mean rather hasty measures for as to confinement or absolute force no such things must or can be attempted
our plan must be concerted for a surprize and not for a storm  these matters were resolved on when mr blifil came to pay a visit to his mistress
the squire no sooner heard of his arrival than he stept aside by his sister's advice to give his daughter orders for the proper reception of her lover which he did with the most bitter execrations and denunciations of judgment on her refusal
the impetuosity of the squire bore down all before him and sophia as her aunt very wisely foresaw was not able to resist him
she agreed therefore to see blifil though she had scarce spirits or strength sufficient to utter her assent
indeed to give a peremptory denial to a father whom she so tenderly loved was no easy task
had this circumstance been out of the case much less resolution than what she was really mistress of would perhaps have served her but it is no unusual thing to ascribe those actions entirely to fear which are in a great measure produced by love
in pursuance therefore of her father's peremptory command sophia now admitted mr blifil's visit
scenes like this when painted at large afford as we have observed very little entertainment to the reader
here therefore we shall strictly adhere to a rule of horace by which writers are directed to pass over all those matters which they despair of placing in a shining lighta rule we conceive of excellent use as well to the historian as to the poet and which if followed must at least have this good effect that many a great evil for so all great books are called would thus be reduced to a small one
it is possible the great art used by blifil at this interview would have prevailed on sophia to have made another man in his circumstances her confident and to have revealed the whole secret of her heart to him but she had contracted so ill an opinion of this young gentleman that she was resolved to place no confidence in him for simplicity when set on its guard is often a match for cunning
her behaviour to him therefore was entirely forced and indeed such as is generally prescribed to virgins upon the second formal visit from one who is appointed for their husband
but though blifil declared himself to the squire perfectly satisfied with his reception yet that gentleman who in company with his sister had overheard all was not so well pleased
he resolved in pursuance of the advice of the sage lady to push matters as forward as possible and addressing himself to his intended soninlaw in the hunting phrase he cried after a loud holla follow her boy follow her run in run in that's it honeys
dead dead dead
never be bashful nor stand shall i shall i
allworthy and i can finish all matters between us this afternoon and let us ha' the wedding tomorrow  blifil having conveyed the utmost satisfaction into his countenance answered as there is nothing sir in this world which i so eagerly desire as an alliance with your family except my union with the most amiable and deserving sophia you may easily imagine how impatient i must be to see myself in possession of my two highest wishes
if i have not therefore importuned you on this head you will impute it only to my fear of offending the lady by endeavouring to hurry on so blessed an event faster than a strict compliance with all the rules of decency and decorum will permit
but if by your interest sir she might be induced to dispense with any formalities  formalities
with a pox answered the squire
pooh all stuff and nonsense
i tell thee she shall ha' thee tomorrow you will know the world better hereafter when you come to my age
women never gi' their consent man if they can help it 'tis not the fashion
if i had stayed for her mother's consent i might have been a batchelor to this dayto her to her co to her that's it you jolly dog
i tell thee shat ha' her tomorrow morning  blifil suffered himself to be overpowered by the forcible rhetoric of the squire and it being agreed that western should close with allworthy that very afternoon the lover departed home having first earnestly begged that no violence might be offered to the lady by this haste in the same manner as a popish inquisitor begs the lay power to do no violence to the heretic delivered over to it and against whom the church hath passed sentence
and to say the truth blifil had passed sentence against sophia for however pleased he had declared himself to western with his reception he was by no means satisfied unless it was that he was convinced of the hatred and scorn of his mistress and this had produced no less reciprocal hatred and scorn in him
it may perhaps be asked why then did he not put an immediate end to all further courtship
i answer for that very reason as well as for several others equally good which we shall now proceed to open to the reader
though mr blifil was not of the complexion of jones nor ready to eat every woman he saw yet he was far from being destitute of that appetite which is said to be the common property of all animals
with this he had likewise that distinguishing taste which serves to direct men in their choice of the object or food of their several appetites and this taught him to consider sophia as a most delicious morsel indeed to regard her with the same desires which an ortolan inspires into the soul of an epicure
now the agonies which affected the mind of sophia rather augmented than impaired her beauty for her tears added brightness to her eyes and her breasts rose higher with her sighs
indeed no one hath seen beauty in its highest lustre who hath never seen it in distress
blifil therefore looked on this human ortolan with greater desire than when he viewed her last nor was his desire at all lessened by the aversion which he discovered in her to himself
on the contrary this served rather to heighten the pleasure he proposed in rifling her charms as it added triumph to lust nay he had some further views from obtaining the absolute possession of her person which we detest too much even to mention and revenge itself was not without its share in the gratifications which he promised himself
the rivalling poor jones and supplanting him in her affections added another spur to his pursuit and promised another additional rapture to his enjoyment
besides all these views which to some scrupulous persons may seem to savour too much of malevolence he had one prospect which few readers will regard with any great abhorrence
and this was the estate of mr western which was all to be settled on his daughter and her issue for so extravagant was the affection of that fond parent that provided his child would but consent to be miserable with the husband he chose he cared not at what price he purchased him
for these reasons mr blifil was so desirous of the match that he intended to deceive sophia by pretending love to her and to deceive her father and his own uncle by pretending he was beloved by her
in doing this he availed himself of the piety of thwackum who held that if the end proposed was religious as surely matrimony is it mattered not how wicked were the means
as to other occasions he used to apply the philosophy of square which taught that the end was immaterial so that the means were fair and consistent with moral rectitude
to say truth there were few occurrences in life on which he could not draw advantage from the precepts of one or other of those great masters
little deceit was indeed necessary to be practised on mr western who thought the inclinations of his daughter of as little consequence as blifil himself conceived them to be but as the sentiments of mr allworthy were of a very different kind so it was absolutely necessary to impose on him
in this however blifil was so well assisted by western that he succeeded without difficulty for as mr allworthy had been assured by her father that sophia had a proper affection for blifil and that all which he had suspected concerning jones was entirely false blifil had nothing more to do than to confirm these assertions which he did with such equivocations that he preserved a salvo for his conscience and had the satisfaction of conveying a lie to his uncle without the guilt of telling one
when he was examined touching the inclinations of sophia by allworthy who said he would on no account be accessary to forcing a young lady into a marriage contrary to her own will he answered that the real sentiments of young ladies were very difficult to be understood that her behaviour to him was full as forward as he wished it and that if he could believe her father she had all the affection for him which any lover could desire
as for jones said he whom i am loth to call villain though his behaviour to you sir sufficiently justifies the appellation his own vanity or perhaps some wicked views might make him boast of a falsehood for if there had been any reality in miss western's love to him the greatness of her fortune would never have suffered him to desert her as you are well informed he hath
lastly sir i promise you i would not myself for any consideration no not for the whole world consent to marry this young lady if i was not persuaded she had all the passion for me which i desire she should have  this excellent method of conveying a falsehood with the heart only without making the tongue guilty of an untruth by the means of equivocation and imposture hath quieted the conscience of many a notable deceiver and yet when we consider that it is omniscience on which these endeavour to impose it may possibly seem capable of affording only a very superficial comfort and that this artful and refined distinction between communicating a lie and telling one is hardly worth the pains it costs them
allworthy was pretty well satisfied with what mr western and mr blifil told him and the treaty was now at the end of two days concluded
nothing then remained previous to the office of the priest but the office of the lawyers which threatened to take up so much time that western offered to bind himself by all manner of covenants rather than defer the happiness of the young couple
indeed he was so very earnest and pressing that an indifferent person might have concluded he was more a principal in this match than he really was but this eagerness was natural to him on all occasions and he conducted every scheme he undertook in such a manner as if the success of that alone was sufficient to constitute the whole happiness of his life
the joint importunities of both father and soninlaw would probably have prevailed on mr allworthy who brooked but ill any delay of giving happiness to others had not sophia herself prevented it and taken measures to put a final end to the whole treaty and to rob both church and law of those taxes which these wise bodies have thought proper to receive from the propagation of the human species in a lawful manner
of which in the next chapter
chapter vii
a strange resolution of sophia and a more strange stratagem of mrs honour
though mrs honour was principally attached to her own interest she was not without some little attachment to sophia
to say truth it was very difficult for any one to know that young lady without loving her
she no sooner therefore heard a piece of news which she imagined to be of great importance to her mistress than quite forgetting the anger which she had conceived two days before at her unpleasant dismission from sophia's presence she ran hastily to inform her of the news
the beginning of her discourse was as abrupt as her entrance into the room
o dear ma'am says she what doth your la'ship think
to be sure i am frightened out of my wits and yet i thought it my duty to tell your la'ship though perhaps it may make you angry for we servants don't always know what will make our ladies angry for to be sure everything is always laid to the charge of a servant
when our ladies are out of humour to be sure we must be scolded and to be sure i should not wonder if your la'ship should be out of humour nay it must surprize you certainly ay and shock you toogood honour let me know it without any longer preface says sophia there are few things i promise you which will surprize and fewer which will shock medear ma'am answered honour to be sure i overheard my master talking to parson supple about getting a licence this very afternoon and to be sure i heard him say your la'ship should be married tomorrow morning sophia turned pale at these words and repeated eagerly tomorrow morningyes ma'am replied the trusty waitingwoman i will take my oath i heard my master say sohonour says sophia you have both surprized and shocked me to such a degree that i have scarce any breath or spirits left
what is to be done in my dreadful situationi wish i was able to advise your la'ship says she
do advise me cries sophia pray dear honour advise me
think what you would attempt if it was your own caseindeed ma'am cries honour i wish your la'ship and i could change situations that is i mean without hurting your la'ship for to be sure i don't wish you so bad as to be a servant but because that if so be it was my case i should find no manner of difficulty in it for in my poor opinion young squire blifil is a charming sweet handsome mandon't mention such stuff cries sophia
such stuff repeated honour why there
well to be sure what's one man's meat is another man's poison and the same is altogether as true of womenhonour says sophia rather than submit to be the wife of that contemptible wretch i would plunge a dagger into my hearto lud
ma'am answered the other i am sure you frighten me out of my wits now
let me beseech your la'ship not to suffer such wicked thoughts to come into your head
o lud
to be sure i tremble every inch of me
dear ma'am consider that to be denied christian burial and to have your corpse buried in the highway and a stake drove through you as farmer halfpenny was served at ox cross and to be sure his ghost hath walked there ever since for several people have seen him
to be sure it can be nothing but the devil which can put such wicked thoughts into the head of anybody for certainly it is less wicked to hurt all the world than one's own dear self and so i have heard said by more parsons than one
if your la'ship hath such a violent aversion and hates the young gentleman so very bad that you can't bear to think of going into bed to him for to be sure there may be such antipathies in nature and one had lieverer touch a toad than the flesh of some people  sophia had been too much wrapt in contemplation to pay any great attention to the foregoing excellent discourse of her maid interrupting her therefore without making any answer to it she said honour i am come to a resolution
i am determined to leave my father's house this very night and if you have the friendship for me which you have often professed you will keep me companythat i will ma'am to the world's end answered honour but i beg your la'ship to consider the consequence before you undertake any rash action
where can your la'ship possibly gothere is replied sophia a lady of quality in london a relation of mine who spent several months with my aunt in the country during all which time she treated me with great kindness and expressed so much pleasure in my company that she earnestly desired my aunt to suffer me to go with her to london
as she is a woman of very great note i shall easily find her out and i make no doubt of being very well and kindly received by heri would not have your la'ship too confident of that cries honour for the first lady i lived with used to invite people very earnestly to her house but if she heard afterwards they were coming she used to get out of the way
besides though this lady would be very glad to see your la'ship as to be sure anybody would be glad to see your la'ship yet when she hears your la'ship is run away from my master you are mistaken honour says sophia she looks upon the authority of a father in a much lower light than i do for she pressed me violently to go to london with her and when i refused to go without my father's consent she laughed me to scorn called me silly country girl and said i should make a pure loving wife since i could be so dutiful a daughter
so i have no doubt but she will both receive me and protect me too till my father finding me out of his power can be brought to some reason  well but ma'am answered honour how doth your la'ship think of making your escape
where will you get any horses or conveyance
for as for your own horse as all the servants know a little how matters stand between my master and your la'ship robin will be hanged before he will suffer it to go out of the stable without my master's express orders i intend to escape said sophia by walking out of the doors when they are open
i thank heaven my legs are very able to carry me
they have supported me many a long eveningyes to be sure cries honour i will follow your la'ship through the world but your la'ship had almost as good be alone for i should not be able to defend you if any robbers or other villains should meet with you
nay i should be in as horrible a fright as your la'ship for to be certain they would ravish us both
besides ma'am consider how cold the nights are now we shall be frozen to deatha good brisk pace answered sophia will preserve us from the cold and if you cannot defend me from a villain honour i will defend you for i will take a pistol with me
there are two always charged in the halldear ma'am you frighten me more and more cries honour sure your la'ship would not venture to fire it off
i had rather run any chance than your la'ship should do thatwhy so says sophia smiling would not you honour fire a pistol at any one who should attack your virtueto be sure ma'am cries honour one's virtue is a dear thing especially to us poor servants for it is our livelihood as a body may say yet i mortally hate firearms for so many accidents happen by themwell well says sophia i believe i may ensure your virtue at a very cheap rate without carrying any arms with us for i intend to take horses at the very first town we come to and we shall hardly be attacked in our way thither
look'ee honour i am resolved to go and if you will attend me i promise you i will reward you to the very utmost of my power  this last argument had a stronger effect on honour than all the preceding
and since she saw her mistress so determined she desisted from any further dissuasions
they then entered into a debate on ways and means of executing their project
here a very stubborn difficulty occurred and this was the removal of their effects which was much more easily got over by the mistress than by the maid for when a lady hath once taken a resolution to run to a lover or to run from him all obstacles are considered as trifles
but honour was inspired by no such motive she had no raptures to expect nor any terrors to shun and besides the real value of her clothes in which consisted a great part of her fortune she had a capricious fondness for several gowns and other things either because they became her or because they were given her by such a particular person because she had bought them lately or because she had had them long or for some other reasons equally good so that she could not endure the thoughts of leaving the poor things behind her exposed to the mercy of western who she doubted not would in his rage make them suffer martyrdom
the ingenious mrs honour having applied all her oratory to dissuade her mistress from her purpose when she found her positively determined at last started the following expedient to remove her clothes viz to get herself turned out of doors that very evening
sophia highly approved this method but doubted how it might be brought about
o ma'am cries honour your la'ship may trust that to me we servants very well know how to obtain this favour of our masters and mistresses though sometimes indeed where they owe us more wages than they can readily pay they will put up with all our affronts and will hardly take any warning we can give them but the squire is none of those and since your la'ship is resolved upon setting out tonight i warrant i get discharged this afternoon it was then resolved that she should pack up some linen and a nightgown for sophia with her own things and as for all her other clothes the young lady abandoned them with no more remorse than the sailor feels when he throws over the goods of others in order to save his own life
chapter viii
containing scenes of altercation of no very uncommon kind
mrs honour had scarce sooner parted from her young lady than something for i would not like the old woman in quevedo injure the devil by any false accusation and possibly he might have no hand in itbut something i say suggested itself to her that by sacrificing sophia and all her secrets to mr western she might probably make her fortune
many considerations urged this discovery
the fair prospect of a handsome reward for so great and acceptable a service to the squire tempted her avarice and again the danger of the enterprize she had undertaken the uncertainty of its success night cold robbers ravishers all alarmed her fears
so forcibly did all these operate upon her that she was almost determined to go directly to the squire and to lay open the whole affair
she was however too upright a judge to decree on one side before she had heard the other
and here first a journey to london appeared very strongly in support of sophia
she eagerly longed to see a place in which she fancied charms short only of those which a raptured saint imagines in heaven
in the next place as she knew sophia to have much more generosity than her master so her fidelity promised her a greater reward than she could gain by treachery
she then crossexamined all the articles which had raised her fears on the other side and found on fairly sifting the matter that there was very little in them
and now both scales being reduced to a pretty even balance her love to her mistress being thrown into the scale of her integrity made that rather preponderate when a circumstance struck upon her imagination which might have had a dangerous effect had its whole weight been fairly put into the other scale
this was the length of time which must intervene before sophia would be able to fulfil her promises for though she was intitled to her mother's fortune at the death of her father and to the sum of  left her by an uncle when she came of age yet these were distant days and many accidents might prevent the intended generosity of the young lady whereas the rewards she might expect from mr western were immediate
but while she was pursuing this thought the good genius of sophia or that which presided over the integrity of mrs honour or perhaps mere chance sent an accident in her way which at once preserved her fidelity and even facilitated the intended business
mrs western's maid claimed great superiority over mrs honour on several accounts
first her birth was higher for her greatgrandmother by the mother's side was a cousin not far removed to an irish peer
secondly her wages were greater
and lastly she had been at london and had of consequence seen more of the world
she had always behaved therefore to mrs honour with that reserve and had always exacted of her those marks of distinction which every order of females preserves and requires in conversation with those of an inferior order
now as honour did not at all times agree with this doctrine but would frequently break in upon the respect which the other demanded mrs western's maid was not at all pleased with her company indeed she earnestly longed to return home to the house of her mistress where she domineered at will over all the other servants
she had been greatly therefore disappointed in the morning when mrs western had changed her mind on the very point of departure and had been in what is vulgarly called a glouting humour ever since
in this humour which was none of the sweetest she came into the room where honour was debating with herself in the manner we have above related
honour no sooner saw her than she addressed her in the following obliging phrase soh madam i find we are to have the pleasure of your company longer which i was afraid the quarrel between my master and your lady would have robbed us ofi don't know madam answered the other what you mean by we and us
i assure you i do not look on any of the servants in this house to be proper company for me
i am company i hope for their betters every day in the week
i do not speak on your account mrs honour for you are a civilized young woman and when you have seen a little more of the world i should not be ashamed to walk with you in st james's parkhoity toity cries honour madam is in her airs i protest
mrs honour forsooth
sure madam you might call me by my sirname for though my lady calls me honour i have a sirname as well as other folks
ashamed to walk with me quotha
marry as good as yourself i hopesince you make such a return to my civility said the other i must acquaint you mrs honour that you are not so good as me
in the country indeed one is obliged to take up with all kind of trumpery but in town i visit none but the women of women of quality
indeed mrs honour there is some difference i hope between you and mei hope so too answered honour there is some difference in our ages andi think in our persons upon speaking which last words she strutted by mrs western's maid with the most provoking air of contempt turning up her nose tossing her head and violently brushing the hoop of her competitor with her own
the other lady put on one of her most malicious sneers and said creature
you are below my anger and it is beneath me to give ill words to such an audacious saucy trollop but hussy i must tell you your breeding shows the meanness of your birth as well as of your education and both very properly qualify you to be the mean servingwoman of a country girldon't abuse my lady cries honour i won't take that of you she's as much better than yours as she is younger and ten thousand times more handsomer  here ill luck or rather good luck sent mrs western to see her maid in tears which began to flow plentifully at her approach and of which being asked the reason by her mistress she presently acquainted her that her tears were occasioned by the rude treatment of that creature theremeaning honour
and madam continued she i could have despised all she said to me but she hath had the audacity to affront your ladyship and to call you uglyyes madam she called you ugly old cat to my face
i could not bear to hear your ladyship called uglywhy do you repeat her impudence so often said mrs western
and then turning to mrs honour she asked her how she had the assurance to mention her name with disrespectdisrespect madam answered honour i never mentioned your name at all i said somebody was not as handsome as my mistress and to be sure you know that as well as ihussy replied the lady i will make such a saucy trollop as yourself know that i am not a proper subject of your discourse
and if my brother doth not discharge you this moment i will never sleep in his house again
i will find him out and have you discharged this momentdischarged cries honour and suppose i am there are more places in the world than one
thank heaven good servants need not want places and if you turn away all who do not think you handsome you will want servants very soon let me tell you that  mrs western spoke or rather thundered in answer but as she was hardly articulate we cannot be very certain of the identical words we shall therefore omit inserting a speech which at best would not greatly redound to her honour
she then departed in search of her brother with a countenance so full of rage that she resembled one of the furies rather than a human creature
the two chambermaids being again left alone began a second bout at altercation which soon produced a combat of a more active kind
in this the victory belonged to the lady of inferior rank but not without some loss of blood of hair and of lawn and muslin
chapter ix
the wise demeanour of mr western in the character of a magistrate
a hint to justices of peace concerning the necessary qualifications of a clerk with extraordinary instances of paternal madness and filial affection
logicians sometimes prove too much by an argument and politicians often overreach themselves in a scheme
thus had it like to have happened to mrs honour who instead of recovering the rest of her clothes had like to have stopped even those she had on her back from escaping for the squire no sooner heard of her having abused his sister than he swore twenty oaths he would send her to bridewell
mrs western was a very goodnatured woman and ordinarily of a forgiving temper
she had lately remitted the trespass of a stagecoachman who had overturned her postchaise into a ditch nay she had even broken the law in refusing to prosecute a highwayman who had robbed her not only of a sum of money but of her earrings at the same time dning her and saying such handsome bs as you don't want jewels to set them off and be dn'd to you but now so uncertain are our tempers and so much do we at different times differ from ourselves she would hear of no mitigation nor could all the affected penitence of honour nor all the entreaties of sophia for her own servant prevail with her to desist from earnestly desiring her brother to execute justiceship for it was indeed a syllable more than justice on the wench
but luckily the clerk had a qualification which no clerk to a justice of peace ought ever to be without namely some understanding in the law of this realm
he therefore whispered in the ear of the justice that he would exceed his authority by committing the girl to bridewell as there had been no attempt to break the peace for i am afraid sir says he you cannot legally commit any one to bridewell only for illbreeding  in matters of high importance particularly in cases relating to the game the justice was not always attentive to these admonitions of his clerk for indeed in executing the laws under that head many justices of peace suppose they have a large discretionary power by virtue of which under the notion of searching for and taking away engines for the destruction of the game they often commit trespasses and sometimes felony at their pleasure
but this offence was not of quite so high a nature nor so dangerous to the society
here therefore the justice behaved with some attention to the advice of his clerk for in fact he had already had two informations exhibited against him in the king's bench and had no curiosity to try a third
the squire therefore putting on a most wise and significant countenance after a preface of several hums and hahs told his sister that upon more mature deliberation he was of opinion that as there was no breaking up of the peace such as the law says he calls breaking open a door or breaking a hedge or breaking a head or any such sort of breaking the matter did not amount to a felonious kind of a thing nor trespasses nor damages and therefore there was no punishment in the law for it  mrs western said she knew the law much better that she had known servants very severely punished for affronting their masters and then named a certain justice of the peace in london who she said would commit a servant to bridewell at any time when a master or mistress desired it  like enough cries the squire it may be so in london but the law is different in the country here followed a very learned dispute between the brother and sister concerning the law which we would insert if we imagined many of our readers could understand it
this was however at length referred by both parties to the clerk who decided it in favour of the magistrate and mrs western was in the end obliged to content herself with the satisfaction of having honour turned away to which sophia herself very readily and cheerfully consented
thus fortune after having diverted herself according to custom with two or three frolicks at last disposed all matters to the advantage of our heroine who indeed succeeded admirably well in her deceit considering it was the first she had ever practised
and to say the truth i have often concluded that the honest part of mankind would be much too hard for the knavish if they could bring themselves to incur the guilt or thought it worth their while to take the trouble
honour acted her part to the utmost perfection
she no sooner saw herself secure from all danger of bridewell a word which had raised most horrible ideas in her mind than she resumed those airs which her terrors before had a little abated and laid down her place with as much affectation of content and indeed of contempt as was ever practised at the resignation of places of much greater importance
if the reader pleases therefore we chuse rather to say she resignedwhich hath indeed been always held a synonymous expression with being turned out or turned away
mr western ordered her to be very expeditious in packing for his sister declared she would not sleep another night under the same roof with so impudent a slut
to work therefore she went and that so earnestly that everything was ready early in the evening when having received her wages away packed bag and baggage to the great satisfaction of every one but of none more than of sophia who having appointed her maid to meet her at a certain place not far from the house exactly at the dreadful and ghostly hour of twelve began to prepare for her own departure
but first she was obliged to give two painful audiences the one to her aunt and the other to her father
in these mrs western herself began to talk to her in a more peremptory stile than before but her father treated her in so violent and outrageous a manner that he frightened her into an affected compliance with his will which so highly pleased the good squire that he changed his frowns into smiles and his menaces into promises he vowed his whole soul was wrapt in hers that her consent for so he construed the words you know sir i must not nor can refuse to obey any absolute command of yours had made him the happiest of mankind
he then gave her a large bankbill to dispose of in any trinkets she pleased and kissed and embraced her in the fondest manner while tears of joy trickled from those eyes which a few moments before had darted fire and rage against the dear object of all his affection
instances of this behaviour in parents are so common that the reader i doubt not will be very little astonished at the whole conduct of mr western
if he should i own i am not able to account for it since that he loved his daughter most tenderly is i think beyond dispute
so indeed have many others who have rendered their children most completely miserable by the same conduct which though it is almost universal in parents hath always appeared to me to be the most unaccountable of all the absurdities which ever entered into the brain of that strange prodigious creature man
the latter part of mr western's behaviour had so strong an effect on the tender heart of sophia that it suggested a thought to her which not all the sophistry of her politic aunt nor all the menaces of her father had ever once brought into her head
she reverenced her father so piously and loved him so passionately that she had scarce ever felt more pleasing sensations than what arose from the share she frequently had of contributing to his amusement and sometimes perhaps to higher gratifications for he never could contain the delight of hearing her commended which he had the satisfaction of hearing almost every day of her life
the idea therefore of the immense happiness she should convey to her father by her consent to this match made a strong impression on her mind
again the extreme piety of such an act of obedience worked very forcibly as she had a very deep sense of religion
lastly when she reflected how much she herself was to suffer being indeed to become little less than a sacrifice or a martyr to filial love and duty she felt an agreeable tickling in a certain little passion which though it bears no immediate affinity either to religion or virtue is often so kind as to lend great assistance in executing the purposes of both
sophia was charmed with the contemplation of so heroic an action and began to compliment herself with much premature flattery when cupid who lay hid in her muff suddenly crept out and like punchinello in a puppetshow kicked all out before him
in truth for we scorn to deceive our reader or to vindicate the character of our heroine by ascribing her actions to supernatural impulse the thoughts of her beloved jones and some hopes however distant in which he was very particularly concerned immediately destroyed all which filial love piety and pride had with their joint endeavours been labouring to bring about
but before we proceed any farther with sophia we must now look back to mr jones
chapter x
containing several matters natural enough perhaps but low
the reader will be pleased to remember that we left mr jones in the beginning of this book on his road to bristol being determined to seek his fortune at sea or rather indeed to fly away from his fortune on shore
it happened a thing not very unusual that the guide who undertook to conduct him on his way was unluckily unacquainted with the road so that having missed his right track and being ashamed to ask information he rambled about backwards and forwards till night came on and it began to grow dark
jones suspecting what had happened acquainted the guide with his apprehensions but he insisted on it that they were in the right road and added it would be very strange if he should not know the road to bristol though in reality it would have been much stranger if he had known it having never past through it in his life before
jones had not such implicit faith in his guide but that on their arrival at a village he inquired of the first fellow he saw whether they were in the road to bristol
whence did you come cries the fellow
no matter says jones a little hastily i want to know if this be the road to bristolthe road to bristol cries the fellow scratching his head why measter i believe you will hardly get to bristol this way tonightprithee friend then answered jones do tell us which is the waywhy measter cries the fellow you must be come out of your road the lord knows whither for thick way goeth to glocesterwell and which way goes to bristol  said jones
why you be going away from bristol answered the fellow
then said jones we must go back againay you must  said the fellow
well and when we come back to the top of the hill which way must we takewhy you must keep the strait roadbut i remember there are two roads one to the right and the other to the leftwhy you must keep the righthand road and then gu strait vorwards only remember to turn vurst to your right and then to your left again and then to your right and that brings you to the squire's and then you must keep strait vorwards and turn to the left  another fellow now came up and asked which way the gentlemen were going of which being informed by jones he first scratched his head and then leaning upon a pole he had in his hand began to tell him that he must keep the righthand road for about a mile or a mile and a half or such a matter and then he must turn short to the left which would bring him round by measter jin bearnes'sbut which is mr john bearnes's says jones
o lord cries the fellow why don't you know measter jin bearnes
whence then did you come  these two fellows had almost conquered the patience of jones when a plain welllooking man who was indeed a quaker accosted him thus friend i perceive thou hast lost thy way and if thou wilt take my advice thou wilt not attempt to find it tonight
it is almost dark and the road is difficult to hit besides there have been several robberies committed lately between this and bristol
here is a very creditable good house just by where thou may'st find good entertainment for thyself and thy cattle till morning jones after a little persuasion agreed to stay in this place till the morning and was conducted by his friend to the publichouse
the landlord who was a very civil fellow told jones he hoped he would excuse the badness of his accommodation for that his wife was gone from home and had locked up almost everything and carried the keys along with her indeed the fact was that a favourite daughter of hers was just married and gone that morning home with her husband and that she and her mother together had almost stript the poor man of all his goods as well as money for though he had several children this daughter only who was the mother's favourite was the object of her consideration and to the humour of this one child she would with pleasure have sacrificed all the rest and her husband into the bargain
though jones was very unfit for any kind of company and would have preferred being alone yet he could not resist the importunities of the honest quaker who was the more desirous of sitting with him from having remarked the melancholy which appeared both in his countenance and behaviour and which the poor quaker thought his conversation might in some measure relieve
after they had past some time together in such a manner that my honest friend might have thought himself at one of his silent meetings the quaker began to be moved by some spirit or other probably that of curiosity and said friend i perceive some sad disaster hath befallen thee but pray be of comfort
perhaps thou hast lost a friend
if so thou must consider we are all mortal
and why shouldst thou grieve when thou knowest thy grief will do thy friend no good
we are all born to affliction
i myself have my sorrows as well as thee and most probably greater sorrows
though i have a clear estate of  a year which is as much as i want and i have a conscience i thank the lord void of offence my constitution is sound and strong and there is no man can demand a debt of me nor accuse me of an injury yet friend i should be concerned to think thee as miserable as myself  here the quaker ended with a deep sigh and jones presently answered i am very sorry sir for your unhappiness whatever is the occasion of itah
friend replied the quaker one only daughter is the occasion one who was my greatest delight upon earth and who within this week is run away from me and is married against my consent
i had provided her a proper match a sober man and one of substance but she forsooth would chuse for herself and away she is gone with a young fellow not worth a groat
if she had been dead as i suppose thy friend is i should have been happythat is very strange sir  said jones
why would it not be better for her to be dead than to be a beggar replied the quaker for as i told you the fellow is not worth a groat and surely she cannot expect that i shall ever give her a shilling
no as she hath married for love let her live on love if she can let her carry her love to market and see whether any one will change it into silver or even into halfpenceyou know your own concerns best sir said jones
it must have been continued the quaker a long premeditated scheme to cheat me for they have known one another from their infancy and i always preached to her against love and told her a thousand times over it was all folly and wickedness
nay the cunning slut pretended to hearken to me and to despise all wantonness of the flesh and yet at last broke out at a window two pair of stairs for i began indeed a little to suspect her and had locked her up carefully intending the very next morning to have married her up to my liking
but she disappointed me within a few hours and escaped away to the lover of her own chusing who lost no time for they were married and bedded and all within an hour
but it shall be the worst hour's work for them both that ever they did for they may starve or beg or steal together for me
i will never give either of them a farthing here jones starting up cried i really must be excused i wish you would leave mecome come friend said the quaker don't give way to concern
you see there are other people miserable besides yourselfi see there are madmen and fools and villains in the world cries jones
but let me give you a piece of advice send for your daughter and soninlaw home and don't be yourself the only cause of misery to one you pretend to lovesend for her and her husband home cries the quaker loudly i would sooner send for the two greatest enemies i have in the worldwell go home yourself or where you please  said jones for i will sit no longer in such companynay friend answered the quaker i scorn to impose my company on any one he then offered to pull money from his pocket but jones pushed him with some violence out of the room
the subject of the quaker's discourse had so deeply affected jones that he stared very wildly all the time he was speaking
this the quaker had observed and this added to the rest of his behaviour inspired honest broadbrim with a conceit that his companion was in reality out of his senses
instead of resenting the affront therefore the quaker was moved with compassion for his unhappy circumstances and having communicated his opinion to the landlord he desired him to take great care of his guest and to treat him with the highest civility
indeed says the landlord i shall use no such civility towards him for it seems for all his laced waistcoat there he is no more a gentleman than myself but a poor parish bastard bred up at a great squire's about thirty miles off and now turned out of doors not for any good to be sure
i shall get him out of my house as soon as possible
if i do lose my reckoning the first loss is always the best
it is not above a year ago that i lost a silver spoon  what dost thou talk of a parish bastard robin answered the quaker
thou must certainly be mistaken in thy man  not at all replied robin the guide who knows him very well told it me for indeed the guide had no sooner taken his place at the kitchen fire than he acquainted the whole company with all he knew or had ever heard concerning jones
the quaker was no sooner assured by this fellow of the birth and low fortune of jones than all compassion for him vanished and the honest plain man went home fired with no less indignation than a duke would have felt at receiving an affront from such a person
the landlord himself conceived an equal disdain for his guest so that when jones rung the bell in order to retire to bed he was acquainted that he could have no bed there
besides disdain of the mean condition of his guest robin entertained violent suspicion of his intentions which were he supposed to watch some favourable opportunity of robbing the house
in reality he might have been very well eased of these apprehensions by the prudent precautions of his wife and daughter who had already removed everything which was not fixed to the freehold but he was by nature suspicious and had been more particularly so since the loss of his spoon
in short the dread of being robbed totally absorbed the comfortable consideration that he had nothing to lose
jones being assured that he could have no bed very contentedly betook himself to a great chair made with rushes when sleep which had lately shunned his company in much better apartments generously paid him a visit in his humble cell
as for the landlord he was prevented by his fears from retiring to rest
he returned therefore to the kitchen fire whence he could survey the only door which opened into the parlour or rather hole where jones was seated and as for the window to that room it was impossible for any creature larger than a cat to have made his escape through it
chapter xi
the adventure of a company of soldiers
the landlord having taken his seat directly opposite to the door of the parlour determined to keep guard there the whole night
the guide and another fellow remained long on duty with him though they neither knew his suspicions nor had any of their own
the true cause of their watching did indeed at length put an end to it for this was no other than the strength and goodness of the beer of which having tippled a very large quantity they grew at first very noisy and vociferous and afterwards fell both asleep
but it was not in the power of liquor to compose the fears of robin
he continued still waking in his chair with his eyes fixed stedfastly on the door which led into the apartment of mr jones till a violent thundering at his outward gate called him from his seat and obliged him to open it which he had no sooner done than his kitchen was immediately full of gentlemen in red coats who all rushed upon him in as tumultuous a manner as if they intended to take his little castle by storm
the landlord was now forced from his post to furnish his numerous guests with beer which they called for with great eagerness and upon his second or third return from the cellar he saw mr jones standing before the fire in the midst of the soldiers for it may easily be believed that the arrival of so much good company should put an end to any sleep unless that from which we are to be awakened only by the last trumpet
the company having now pretty well satisfied their thirst nothing remained but to pay the reckoning a circumstance often productive of much mischief and discontent among the inferior rank of gentry who are apt to find great difficulty in assessing the sum with exact regard to distributive justice which directs that every man shall pay according to the quantity which he drinks
this difficulty occurred upon the present occasion and it was the greater as some gentlemen had in their extreme hurry marched off after their first draught and had entirely forgot to contribute anything towards the said reckoning
a violent dispute now arose in which every word may be said to have been deposed upon oath for the oaths were at least equal to all the other words spoken
in this controversy the whole company spoke together and every man seemed wholly bent to extenuate the sum which fell to his share so that the most probable conclusion which could be foreseen was that a large portion of the reckoning would fall to the landlord's share to pay or what is much the same thing would remain unpaid
all this while mr jones was engaged in conversation with the serjeant for that officer was entirely unconcerned in the present dispute being privileged by immemorial custom from all contribution
the dispute now grew so very warm that it seemed to draw towards a military decision when jones stepping forward silenced all their clamours at once by declaring that he would pay the whole reckoning which indeed amounted to no more than three shillings and fourpence
this declaration procured jones the thanks and applause of the whole company
the terms honourable noble and worthy gentleman resounded through the room nay my landlord himself began to have a better opinion of him and almost to disbelieve the account which the guide had given
the serjeant had informed mr jones that they were marching against the rebels and expected to be commanded by the glorious duke of cumberland
by which the reader may perceive a circumstance which we have not thought necessary to communicate before that this was the very time when the late rebellion was at the highest and indeed the banditti were now marched into england intending as it was thought to fight the king's forces and to attempt pushing forward to the metropolis
jones had some heroic ingredients in his composition and was a hearty wellwisher to the glorious cause of liberty and of the protestant religion
it is no wonder therefore that in circumstances which would have warranted a much more romantic and wild undertaking it should occur to him to serve as a volunteer in this expedition
our commanding officer had said all in his power to encourage and promote this good disposition from the first moment he had been acquainted with it
he now proclaimed the noble resolution aloud which was received with great pleasure by the whole company who all cried out god bless king george and your honour and then added with many oaths we will stand by you both to the last drops of our blood  the gentleman who had been all night tippling at the alehouse was prevailed on by some arguments which a corporal had put into his hands to undertake the same expedition
and now the portmanteau belonging to mr jones being put up in the baggagecart the forces were about to move forwards when the guide stepping up to jones said sir i hope you will consider that the horses have been kept out all night and we have travelled a great ways out of our way  jones was surprized at the impudence of this demand and acquainted the soldiers with the merits of his cause who were all unanimous in condemning the guide for his endeavours to put upon a gentleman
some said he ought to be tied neck and heels others that he deserved to run the gantlope and the serjeant shook his cane at him and wished he had him under his command swearing heartily he would make an example of him
jones contented himself however with a negative punishment and walked off with his new comrades leaving the guide to the poor revenge of cursing and reviling him in which latter the landlord joined saying ay ay he is a pure one i warrant you
a pretty gentleman indeed to go for a soldier
he shall wear a laced wastecoat truly
it is an old proverb and a true one all is not gold that glisters
i am glad my house is well rid of him  all that day the serjeant and the young soldier marched together and the former who was an arch fellow told the latter many entertaining stories of his campaigns though in reality he had never made any for he was but lately come into the service and had by his own dexterity so well ingratiated himself with his officers that he had promoted himself to a halberd chiefly indeed by his merit in recruiting in which he was most excellently well skilled
much mirth and festivity passed among the soldiers during their march
in which the many occurrences that had passed at their last quarters were remembered and every one with great freedom made what jokes he pleased on his officers some of which were of the coarser kind and very near bordering on scandal
this brought to our heroe's mind the custom which he had read of among the greeks and romans of indulging on certain festivals and solemn occasions the liberty to slaves of using an uncontrouled freedom of speech towards their masters
our little army which consisted of two companies of foot were now arrived at the place where they were to halt that evening
the serjeant then acquainted his lieutenant who was the commanding officer that they had picked up two fellows in that day's march one of which he said was as fine a man as ever he saw meaning the tippler for that he was near six feet well proportioned and strongly limbed and the other meaning jones would do well enough for the rear rank
the new soldiers were now produced before the officer who having examined the sixfeet man he being first produced came next to survey jones at the first sight of whom the lieutenant could not help showing some surprize for besides that he was very well dressed and was naturally genteel he had a remarkable air of dignity in his look which is rarely seen among the vulgar and is indeed not inseparably annexed to the features of their superiors
sir said the lieutenant my serjeant informed me that you are desirous of enlisting in the company i have at present under my command if so sir we shall very gladly receive a gentleman who promises to do much honour to the company by bearing arms in it  jones answered that he had not mentioned anything of enlisting himself that he was most zealously attached to the glorious cause for which they were going to fight and was very desirous of serving as a volunteer concluding with some compliments to the lieutenant and expressing the great satisfaction he should have in being under his command
the lieutenant returned his civility commended his resolution shook him by the hand and invited him to dine with himself and the rest of the officers
chapter xii
the adventure of a company of officers
the lieutenant whom we mentioned in the preceding chapter and who commanded this party was now near sixty years of age
he had entered very young into the army and had served in the capacity of an ensign at the battle of tannieres here he had received two wounds and had so well distinguished himself that he was by the duke of marlborough advanced to be a lieutenant immediately after that battle
in this commission he had continued ever since viz near forty years during which time he had seen vast numbers preferred over his head and had now the mortification to be commanded by boys whose fathers were at nurse when he first entered into the service
nor was this ill success in his profession solely owing to his having no friends among the men in power
he had the misfortune to incur the displeasure of his colonel who for many years continued in the command of this regiment
nor did he owe the implacable illwill which this man bore him to any neglect or deficiency as an officer nor indeed to any fault in himself but solely to the indiscretion of his wife who was a very beautiful woman and who though she was remarkably fond of her husband would not purchase his preferment at the expense of certain favours which the colonel required of her
the poor lieutenant was more peculiarly unhappy in this that while he felt the effects of the enmity of his colonel he neither knew nor suspected that he really bore him any for he could not suspect an illwill for which he was not conscious of giving any cause and his wife fearing what her husband's nice regard to his honour might have occasioned contented herself with preserving her virtue without enjoying the triumphs of her conquest
this unfortunate officer for so i think he may be called had many good qualities besides his merit in his profession for he was a religious honest goodnatured man and had behaved so well in his command that he was highly esteemed and beloved not only by the soldiers of his own company but by the whole regiment
the other officers who marched with him were a french lieutenant who had been long enough out of france to forget his own language but not long enough in england to learn ours so that he really spoke no language at all and could barely make himself understood on the most ordinary occasions
there were likewise two ensigns both very young fellows one of whom had been bred under an attorney and the other was son to the wife of a nobleman's butler
as soon as dinner was ended jones informed the company of the merriment which had passed among the soldiers upon their march and yet says he notwithstanding all their vociferation i dare swear they will behave more like grecians than trojans when they come to the enemygrecians and trojans says one of the ensigns who the devil are they
i have heard of all the troops in europe but never of any such as these  don't pretend to more ignorance than you have mr northerton said the worthy lieutenant
i suppose you have heard of the greeks and trojans though perhaps you never read pope's homer who i remember now the gentleman mentions it compares the march of the trojans to the cackling of geese and greatly commends the silence of the grecians
and upon my honour there is great justice in the cadet's observation  begar me remember dem ver well said the french lieutenant me ave read them at school in dans madam daciere des greek des trojan dey fight for von womanouy ouy me ave read all dat  dn homo with all my heart says northerton i have the marks of him on my a yet
there's thomas of our regiment always carries a homo in his pocket dn me if ever i come at it if i don't burn it
and there's corderius another dn'd son of a whore that hath got me many a flogging  then you have been at school mr northerton said the lieutenant
ay dn me have i answered he the devil take my father for sending me thither
the old put wanted to make a parson of me but dn me thinks i to myself i'll nick you there old cull the devil a smack of your nonsense shall you ever get into me
there's jemmy oliver of our regiment he narrowly escaped being a pimp too and that would have been a thousand pities for dn me if he is not one of the prettiest fellows in the whole world but he went farther than i with the old cull for jimmey can neither write nor read  you give your friend a very good character said the lieutenant and a very deserved one i dare say
but prithee northerton leave off that foolish as well as wicked custom of swearing for you are deceived i promise you if you think there is wit or politeness in it
i wish too you would take my advice and desist from abusing the clergy
scandalous names and reflections cast on any body of men must be always unjustifiable but especially so when thrown on so sacred a function for to abuse the body is to abuse the function itself and i leave to you to judge how inconsistent such behaviour is in men who are going to fight in defence of the protestant religion  mr adderly which was the name of the other ensign had sat hitherto kicking his heels and humming a tune without seeming to listen to the discourse he now answered o monsieur on ne parle pas de la religion dans la guerrewell said jack cries northerton if la religion was the only matter the parsons should fight their own battles for me  i don't know gentlemen said jones what may be your opinion but i think no man can engage in a nobler cause than that of his religion and i have observed in the little i have read of history that no soldiers have fought so bravely as those who have been inspired with a religious zeal for my own part though i love my king and country i hope as well as any man in it yet the protestant interest is no small motive to my becoming a volunteer in the cause  northerton now winked on adderly and whispered to him slily smoke the prig adderly smoke him then turning to jones said to him i am very glad sir you have chosen our regiment to be a volunteer in for if our parson should at any time take a cup too much i find you can supply his place
i presume sir you have been at the university may i crave the favour to know what college  sir answered jones so far from having been at the university i have even had the advantage of yourself for i was never at school  i presumed cries the ensign only upon the information of your great learningoh
sir answered jones it is as possible for a man to know something without having been at school as it is to have been at school and to know nothing  well said young volunteer cries the lieutenant
upon my word northerton you had better let him alone for he will be too hard for you  northerton did not very well relish the sarcasm of jones but he thought the provocation was scarce sufficient to justify a blow or a rascal or scoundrel which were the only repartees that suggested themselves
he was therefore silent at present but resolved to take the first opportunity of returning the jest by abuse
it now came to the turn of mr jones to give a toast as it is called who could not refrain from mentioning his dear sophia
this he did the more readily as he imagined it utterly impossible that any one present should guess the person he meant
but the lieutenant who was the toastmaster was not contented with sophia only
he said he must have her sirname upon which jones hesitated a little and presently after named miss sophia western
ensign northerton declared he would not drink her health in the same round with his own toast unless somebody would vouch for her
i knew one sophy western says he that was lain with by half the young fellows at bath and perhaps this is the same woman jones very solemnly assured him of the contrary asserting that the young lady he named was one of great fashion and fortune
ay ay says the ensign and so she is dn me it is the same woman and i'll hold half a dozen of burgundy tom french of our regiment brings her into company with us at any tavern in bridgesstreet he then proceeded to describe her person exactly for he had seen her with her aunt and concluded with saying that her father had a great estate in somersetshire  the tenderness of lovers can ill brook the least jesting with the names of their mistresses
however jones though he had enough of the lover and of the heroe too in his disposition did not resent these slanders as hastily as perhaps he ought to have done
to say the truth having seen but little of this kind of wit he did not readily understand it and for a long time imagined mr northerton had really mistaken his charmer for some other
but now turning to the ensign with a stern aspect he said pray sir chuse some other subject for your wit for i promise you i will bear no jesting with this lady's character jesting cries the other dn me if ever i was more in earnest in my life
tom french of our regiment had both her and her aunt at bath then i must tell you in earnest cries jones that you are one of the most impudent rascals upon earth  he had no sooner spoken these words than the ensign together with a volley of curses discharged a bottle full at the head of jones which hitting him a little above the right temple brought him instantly to the ground
the conqueror perceiving the enemy to lie motionless before him and blood beginning to flow pretty plentifully from his wound began now to think of quitting the field of battle where no more honour was to be gotten but the lieutenant interposed by stepping before the door and thus cut off his retreat
northerton was very importunate with the lieutenant for his liberty urging the ill consequences of his stay asking him what he could have done less
zounds says he i was but in jest with the fellow
i never heard any harm of miss western in my life have not you  said the lieutenant then you richly deserve to be hanged as well for making such jests as for using such a weapon you are my prisoner sir nor shall you stir from hence till a proper guard comes to secure you  such an ascendant had our lieutenant over this ensign that all that fervency of courage which had levelled our poor heroe with the floor would scarce have animated the said ensign to have drawn his sword against the lieutenant had he then had one dangling at his side but all the swords being hung up in the room were at the very beginning of the fray secured by the french officer
so that mr northerton was obliged to attend the final issue of this affair
the french gentleman and mr adderly at the desire of their commanding officer had raised up the body of jones but as they could perceive but little if any sign of life in him they again let him fall adderly damning him for having blooded his wastecoat and the frenchman declaring begar me no tush the engliseman de mort me have heard de englise ley law what you call hang up de man dat tush him last  when the good lieutenant applied himself to the door he applied himself likewise to the bell and the drawer immediately attending he dispatched him for a file of musqueteers and a surgeon
these commands together with the drawer's report of what he had himself seen not only produced the soldiers but presently drew up the landlord of the house his wife and servants and indeed every one else who happened at that time to be in the inn
to describe every particular and to relate the whole conversation of the ensuing scene is not within my power unless i had forty pens and could at once write with them all together as the company now spoke
the reader must therefore content himself with the most remarkable incidents and perhaps he may very well excuse the rest
the first thing done was securing the body of northerton who being delivered into the custody of six men with a corporal at their head was by them conducted from a place which he was very willing to leave but it was unluckily to a place whither he was very unwilling to go
to say the truth so whimsical are the desires of ambition the very moment this youth had attained the abovementioned honour he would have been well contented to have retired to some corner of the world where the fame of it should never have reached his ears
it surprizes us and so perhaps it may the reader that the lieutenant a worthy and good man should have applied his chief care rather to secure the offender than to preserve the life of the wounded person
we mention this observation not with any view of pretending to account for so odd a behaviour but lest some critic should hereafter plume himself on discovering it
we would have these gentlemen know we can see what is odd in characters as well as themselves but it is our business to relate facts as they are which when we have done it is the part of the learned and sagacious reader to consult that original book of nature whence every passage in our work is transcribed though we quote not always the particular page for its authority
the company which now arrived were of a different disposition
they suspended their curiosity concerning the person of the ensign till they should see him hereafter in a more engaging attitude
at present their whole concern and attention were employed about the bloody object on the floor which being placed upright in a chair soon began to discover some symptoms of life and motion
these were no sooner perceived by the company for jones was at first generally concluded to be dead than they all fell at once to prescribing for him for as none of the physical order was present every one there took that office upon him
bleeding was the unanimous voice of the whole room but unluckily there was no operator at hand every one then cried call the barber but none stirred a step
several cordials was likewise prescribed in the same ineffective manner till the landlord ordered up a tankard of strong beer with a toast which he said was the best cordial in england
the person principally assistant on this occasion indeed the only one who did any service or seemed likely to do any was the landlady she cut off some of her hair and applied it to the wound to stop the blood she fell to chafing the youth's temples with her hand and having exprest great contempt for her husband's prescription of beer she despatched one of her maids to her own closet for a bottle of brandy of which as soon as it was brought she prevailed on jones who was just returned to his senses to drink a very large and plentiful draught
soon afterwards arrived the surgeon who having viewed the wound having shaken his head and blamed everything which was done ordered his patient instantly to bed in which place we think proper to leave him some time to his repose and shall here therefore put an end to this chapter
chapter xiii
containing the great address of the landlady the great learning of a surgeon and the solid skill in casuistry of the worthy lieutenant
when the wounded man was carried to his bed and the house began again to clear up from the hurry which this accident had occasioned the landlady thus addressed the commanding officer i am afraid sir  said she this young man did not behave himself as well as he should do to your honours and if he had been killed i suppose he had but his desarts to be sure when gentlemen admit inferior parsons into their company they oft to keep their distance but as my first husband used to say few of 'em know how to do it
for my own part i am sure i should not have suffered any fellows to include themselves into gentlemen's company but i thoft he had been an officer himself till the serjeant told me he was but a recruit  landlady answered the lieutenant you mistake the whole matter
the young man behaved himself extremely well and is i believe a much better gentleman than the ensign who abused him
if the young fellow dies the man who struck him will have most reason to be sorry for it for the regiment will get rid of a very troublesome fellow who is a scandal to the army and if he escapes from the hands of justice blame me madam that's all  ay
ay
good lackaday said the landlady who could have thoft it
ay ay ay i am satisfied your honour will see justice done and to be sure it oft to be to every one
gentlemen oft not to kill poor folks without answering for it
a poor man hath a soul to be saved as well as his betters  indeed madam said the lieutenant you do the volunteer wrong i dare swear he is more of a gentleman than the officer  ay cries the landlady why look you there now well my first husband was a wise man he used to say you can't always know the inside by the outside
nay that might have been well enough too for i never saw'd him till he was all over blood
who would have thoft it
mayhap some young gentleman crossed in love
good lackaday if he should die what a concern it will be to his parents
why sure the devil must possess the wicked wretch to do such an act
to be sure he is a scandal to the army as your honour says for most of the gentlemen of the army that ever i saw are quite different sort of people and look as if they would scorn to spill any christian blood as much as any men i mean that is in a civil way as my first husband used to say
to be sure when they come into the wars there must be bloodshed but that they are not to be blamed for
the more of our enemies they kill there the better and i wish with all my heart they could kill every mother's son of them  o fie madam said the lieutenant smiling all is rather too bloodyminded a wish  not at all sir answered she i am not at all bloodyminded only to our enemies and there is no harm in that
to be sure it is natural for us to wish our enemies dead that the wars may be at an end and our taxes be lowered for it is a dreadful thing to pay as we do
why now there is above forty shillings for windowlights and yet we have stopt up all we could we have almost blinded the house i am sure
says i to the exciseman says i i think you oft to favour us i am sure we are very good friends to the government and so we are for sartain for we pay a mint of money to 'um
and yet i often think to myself the government doth not imagine itself more obliged to us than to those that don't pay 'um a farthing
ay ay it is the way of the world  she was proceeding in this manner when the surgeon entered the room
the lieutenant immediately asked how his patient did
but he resolved him only by saying better i believe than he would have been by this time if i had not been called and even as it is perhaps it would have been lucky if i could have been called sooneri hope sir said the lieutenant the skull is not fracturedhum cries the surgeon fractures are not always the most dangerous symptoms
contusions and lacerations are often attended with worse phaenomena and with more fatal consequences than fractures
people who know nothing of the matter conclude if the skull is not fractured all is well whereas i had rather see a man's skull broke all to pieces than some contusions i have met withi hope says the lieutenant there are no such symptoms heresymptoms answered the surgeon are not always regular nor constant
i have known very unfavourable symptoms in the morning change to favourable ones at noon and return to unfavourable again at night
of wounds indeed it is rightly and truly said nemo repente fuit turpissimus
i was once i remember called to a patient who had received a violent contusion in his tibia by which the exterior cutis was lacerated so that there was a profuse sanguinary discharge and the interior membranes were so divellicated that the os or bone very plainly appeared through the aperture of the vulnus or wound
some febrile symptoms intervening at the same time for the pulse was exuberant and indicated much phlebotomy i apprehended an immediate mortification
to prevent which i presently made a large orifice in the vein of the left arm whence i drew twenty ounces of blood which i expected to have found extremely sizy and glutinous or indeed coagulated as it is in pleuretic complaints but to my surprize it appeared rosy and florid and its consistency differed little from the blood of those in perfect health
i then applied a fomentation to the part which highly answered the intention and after three or four times dressing the wound began to discharge a thick pus or matter by which means the cohesionbut perhaps i do not make myself perfectly well understoodno really answered the lieutenant i cannot say i understand a syllablewell sir said the surgeon then i shall not tire your patience in short within six weeks my patient was able to walk upon his legs as perfectly as he could have done before he received the contusioni wish sir said the lieutenant you would be so kind only to inform me whether the wound this young gentleman hath had the misfortune to receive is likely to prove mortalsir answered the surgeon to say whether a wound will prove mortal or not at first dressing would be very weak and foolish presumption we are all mortal and symptoms often occur in a cure which the greatest of our profession could never foreseebut do you think him in danger  says the otherin danger
ay surely cries the doctor who is there among us who in the most perfect health can be said not to be in danger
can a man therefore with so bad a wound as this be said to be out of danger
all i can say at present is that it is well i was called as i was and perhaps it would have been better if i had been called sooner
i will see him again early in the morning and in the meantime let him be kept extremely quiet and drink liberally of watergruelwon't you allow him sackwhey said the landladyay ay sackwhey cries the doctor if you will provided it be very smalland a little chicken broth too added sheyes yes chicken broth said the doctor is very goodmayn't i make him some jellies too said the landladyay ay answered the doctor jellies are very good for wounds for they promote cohesion and indeed it was lucky she had not named soup or high sauces for the doctor would have complied rather than have lost the custom of the house
the doctor was no sooner gone than the landlady began to trumpet forth his fame to the lieutenant who had not from their short acquaintance conceived quite so favourable an opinion of his physical abilities as the good woman and all the neighbourhood entertained and perhaps very rightly for though i am afraid the doctor was a little of a coxcomb he might be nevertheless very much of a surgeon
the lieutenant having collected from the learned discourse of the surgeon that mr jones was in great danger gave orders for keeping mr northerton under a very strict guard designing in the morning to attend him to a justice of peace and to commit the conducting the troops to gloucester to the french lieutenant who though he could neither read write nor speak any language was however a good officer
in the evening our commander sent a message to mr jones that if a visit would not be troublesome he would wait on him
this civility was very kindly and thankfully received by jones and the lieutenant accordingly went up to his room where he found the wounded man much better than he expected nay jones assured his friend that if he had not received express orders to the contrary from the surgeon he should have got up long ago for he appeared to himself to be as well as ever and felt no other inconvenience from his wound but an extreme soreness on that side of his head
i should be very glad quoth the lieutenant if you was as well as you fancy yourself for then you could be able to do yourself justice immediately for when a matter can't be made up as in case of a blow the sooner you take him out the better but i am afraid you think yourself better than you are and he would have too much advantage over you  i'll try however answered jones if you please and will be so kind to lend me a sword for i have none here of my own  my sword is heartily at your service my dear boy cries the lieutenant kissing him you are a brave lad and i love your spirit but i fear your strength for such a blow and so much loss of blood must have very much weakened you and though you feel no want of strength in your bed yet you most probably would after a thrust or two
i can't consent to your taking him out tonight but i hope you will be able to come up with us before we get many days' march advance and i give you my honour you shall have satisfaction or the man who hath injured you shan't stay in our regiment  i wish said jones it was possible to decide this matter tonight now you have mentioned it to me i shall not be able to rest  oh never think of it returned the other a few days will make no difference
the wounds of honour are not like those in your body they suffer nothing by the delay of cure
it will be altogether as well for you to receive satisfaction a week hence as now  but suppose says jones i should grow worse and die of the consequences of my present wound  then your honour answered the lieutenant will require no reparation at all
i myself will do justice to your character and testify to the world your intention to have acted properly if you had recovered  still replied jones i am concerned at the delay
i am almost afraid to mention it to you who are a soldier but though i have been a very wild young fellow still in my most serious moments and at the bottom i am really a christian  so am i too i assure you said the officer and so zealous a one that i was pleased with you at dinner for taking up the cause of your religion and i am a little offended with you now young gentleman that you should express a fear of declaring your faith before any one  but how terrible must it be cries jones to any one who is really a christian to cherish malice in his breast in opposition to the command of him who hath expressly forbid it
how can i bear to do this on a sickbed
or how shall i make up my account with such an article as this in my bosom against me  why i believe there is such a command cries the lieutenant but a man of honour can't keep it
and you must be a man of honour if you will be in the army
i remember i once put the case to our chaplain over a bowl of punch and he confessed there was much difficulty in it but he said he hoped there might be a latitude granted to soldiers in this one instance and to be sure it is our duty to hope so for who would bear to live without his honour
no no my dear boy be a good christian as long as you live but be a man of honour too and never put up an affront not all the books nor all the parsons in the world shall ever persuade me to that
i love my religion very well but i love my honour more
there must be some mistake in the wording the text or in the translation or in the understanding it or somewhere or other
but however that be a man must run the risque for he must preserve his honour
so compose yourself tonight and i promise you you shall have an opportunity of doing yourself justice here he gave jones a hearty buss shook him by the hand and took his leave
but though the lieutenant's reasoning was very satisfactory to himself it was not entirely so to his friend
jones therefore having revolved this matter much in his thoughts at last came to a resolution which the reader will find in the next chapter
chapter xiv
a most dreadful chapter indeed and which few readers ought to venture upon in an evening especially when alone
jones swallowed a large mess of chicken or rather cock broth with a very good appetite as indeed he would have done the cock it was made of with a pound of bacon into the bargain and now finding in himself no deficiency of either health or spirit he resolved to get up and seek his enemy
but first he sent for the serjeant who was his first acquaintance among these military gentlemen
unluckily that worthy officer having in a literal sense taken his fill of liquor had been some time retired to his bolster where he was snoring so loud that it was not easy to convey a noise in at his ears capable of drowning that which issued from his nostrils
however as jones persisted in his desire of seeing him a vociferous drawer at length found means to disturb his slumbers and to acquaint him with the message
of which the serjeant was no sooner made sensible than he arose from his bed and having his clothes already on immediately attended
jones did not think fit to acquaint the serjeant with his design though he might have done it with great safety for the halberdier was himself a man of honour and had killed his man
he would therefore have faithfully kept this secret or indeed any other which no reward was published for discovering
but as jones knew not those virtues in so short an acquaintance his caution was perhaps prudent and commendable enough
he began therefore by acquainting the serjeant that as he was now entered into the army he was ashamed of being without what was perhaps the most necessary implement of a soldier namely a sword adding that he should be infinitely obliged to him if he could procure one
for which says he i will give you any reasonable price nor do i insist upon its being silverhilted only a good blade and such as may become a soldier's thigh  the serjeant who well knew what had happened and had heard that jones was in a very dangerous condition immediately concluded from such a message at such a time of night and from a man in such a situation that he was lightheaded
now as he had his wit to use that word in its common signification always ready he bethought himself of making his advantage of this humour in the sick man
sir  says he i believe i can fit you
i have a most excellent piece of stuff by me
it is not indeed silverhilted which as you say doth not become a soldier but the handle is decent enough and the blade one of the best in europe
it is a blade thata blade thatin short i will fetch it you this instant and you shall see it and handle it
i am glad to see your honour so well with all my heart  being instantly returned with the sword he delivered it to jones who took it and drew it and then told the serjeant it would do very well and bid him name his price
the serjeant now began to harangue in praise of his goods
he said nay he swore very heartily that the blade was taken from a french officer of very high rank at the battle of dettingen
i took it myself says he from his side after i had knocked him o' the head
the hilt was a golden one
that i sold to one of our fine gentlemen for there are some of them an't please your honour who value the hilt of a sword more than the blade  here the other stopped him and begged him to name a price
the serjeant who thought jones absolutely out of his senses and very near his end was afraid lest he should injure his family by asking too little
however after a moment's hesitation he contented himself with naming twenty guineas and swore he would not sell it for less to his own brother
twenty guineas says jones in the utmost surprize sure you think i am mad or that i never saw a sword in my life
twenty guineas indeed
i did not imagine you would endeavour to impose upon me
here take the swordno now i think on't i will keep it myself and show it your officer in the morning acquainting him at the same time what a price you asked me for it  the serjeant as we have said had always his wit in sensu praedicto about him and now plainly saw that jones was not in the condition he had apprehended him to be he now therefore counterfeited as great surprize as the other had shown and said i am certain sir i have not asked you so much out of the way
besides you are to consider it is the only sword i have and i must run the risque of my officer's displeasure by going without one myself
and truly putting all this together i don't think twenty shillings was so much out of the way  twenty shillings cries jones why you just now asked me twenty guineashow cries the serjeant sure your honour must have mistaken me or else i mistook myselfand indeed i am but half awake
twenty guineas indeed
no wonder your honour flew into such a passion
i say twenty guineas too
no no i mean twenty shillings i assure you
and when your honour comes to consider everything i hope you will not think that so extravagant a price
it is indeed true you may buy a weapon which looks as well for less money
but  here jones interrupted him saying i will be so far from making any words with you that i will give you a shilling more than your demand he then gave him a guinea bid him return to his bed and wished him a good march adding he hoped to overtake them before the division reached worcester
the serjeant very civilly took his leave fully satisfied with his merchandize and not a little pleased with his dexterous recovery from that false step into which his opinion of the sick man's lightheadedness had betrayed him
as soon as the serjeant was departed jones rose from his bed and dressed himself entirely putting on even his coat which as its colour was white showed very visibly the streams of blood which had flowed down it and now having grasped his newpurchased sword in his hand he was going to issue forth when the thought of what he was about to undertake laid suddenly hold of him and he began to reflect that in a few minutes he might possibly deprive a human being of life or might lose his own
very well said he and in what cause do i venture my life
why in that of my honour
and who is this human being
a rascal who hath injured and insulted me without provocation
but is not revenge forbidden by heaven
yes but it is enjoined by the world
well but shall i obey the world in opposition to the express commands of heaven
shall i incur the divine displeasure rather than be calledhacowardscoundreli'll think no more i am resolved and must fight him  the clock had now struck twelve and every one in the house were in their beds except the centinel who stood to guard northerton when jones softly opening his door issued forth in pursuit of his enemy of whose place of confinement he had received a perfect description from the drawer
it is not easy to conceive a much more tremendous figure than he now exhibited
he had on as we have said a lightcoloured coat covered with streams of blood
his face which missed that very blood as well as twenty ounces more drawn from him by the surgeon was pallid
round his head was a quantity of bandage not unlike a turban
in the right hand he carried a sword and in the left a candle
so that the bloody banquo was not worthy to be compared to him
in fact i believe a more dreadful apparition was never raised in a churchyard nor in the imagination of any good people met in a winter evening over a christmas fire in somersetshire
when the centinel first saw our heroe approach his hair began gently to lift up his grenadier cap and in the same instant his knees fell to blows with each other
presently his whole body was seized with worse than an ague fit
he then fired his piece and fell flat on his face
whether fear or courage was the occasion of his firing or whether he took aim at the object of his terror i cannot say
if he did however he had the good fortune to miss his man
jones seeing the fellow fall guessed the cause of his fright at which he could not forbear smiling not in the least reflecting on the danger from which he had just escaped
he then passed by the fellow who still continued in the posture in which he fell and entered the room where northerton as he had heard was confined
here in a solitary situation he foundan empty quart pot standing on the table on which some beer being spilt it looked as if the room had lately been inhabited but at present it was entirely vacant
jones then apprehended it might lead to some other apartment but upon searching all round it he could perceive no other door than that at which he entered and where the centinel had been posted
he then proceeded to call northerton several times by his name but no one answered nor did this serve to any other purpose than to confirm the centinel in his terrors who was now convinced that the volunteer was dead of his wounds and that his ghost was come in search of the murderer he now lay in all the agonies of horror and i wish with all my heart some of those actors who are hereafter to represent a man frighted out of his wits had seen him that they might be taught to copy nature instead of performing several antic tricks and gestures for the entertainment and applause of the galleries
perceiving the bird was flown at least despairing to find him and rightly apprehending that the report of the firelock would alarm the whole house our heroe now blew out his candle and gently stole back again to his chamber and to his bed whither he would not have been able to have gotten undiscovered had any other person been on the same staircase save only one gentleman who was confined to his bed by the gout for before he could reach the door to his chamber the hall where the centinel had been posted was half full of people some in their shirts and others not half drest all very earnestly enquiring of each other what was the matter
the soldier was now found lying in the same place and posture in which we just now left him
several immediately applied themselves to raise him and some concluded him dead but they presently saw their mistake for he not only struggled with those who laid their hands on him but fell a roaring like a bull
in reality he imagined so many spirits or devils were handling him for his imagination being possessed with the horror of an apparition converted every object he saw or felt into nothing but ghosts and spectres
at length he was overpowered by numbers and got upon his legs when candles being brought and seeing two or three of his comrades present he came a little to himself but when they asked him what was the matter
he answered i am a dead man that's all i am a dead man i can't recover it i have seen him what hast thou seen jack says one of the soldiers
why i have seen the young volunteer that was killed yesterday he then imprecated the most heavy curses on himself if he had not seen the volunteer all over blood vomiting fire out of his mouth and nostrils pass by him into the chamber where ensign northerton was and then seizing the ensign by the throat fly away with him in a clap of thunder
this relation met with a gracious reception from the audience
all the women present believed it firmly and prayed heaven to defend them from murder
amongst the men too many had faith in the story but others turned it into derision and ridicule and a serjeant who was present answered very coolly young man you will hear more of this for going to sleep and dreaming on your post  the soldier replied you may punish me if you please but i was as broad awake as i am now and the devil carry me away as he hath the ensign if i did not see the dead man as i tell you with eyes as big and as fiery as two large flambeaux  the commander of the forces and the commander of the house were now both arrived for the former being awake at the time and hearing the centinel fire his piece thought it his duty to rise immediately though he had no great apprehensions of any mischief whereas the apprehensions of the latter were much greater lest her spoons and tankards should be upon the march without having received any such orders from her
our poor centinel to whom the sight of this officer was not much more welcome than the apparition as he thought it which he had seen before again related the dreadful story and with many additions of blood and fire but he had the misfortune to gain no credit with either of the lastmentioned persons for the officer though a very religious man was free from all terrors of this kind besides having so lately left jones in the condition we have seen he had no suspicion of his being dead
as for the landlady though not over religious she had no kind of aversion to the doctrine of spirits but there was a circumstance in the tale which she well knew to be false as we shall inform the reader presently
but whether northerton was carried away in thunder or fire or in whatever other manner he was gone it was now certain that his body was no longer in custody
upon this occasion the lieutenant formed a conclusion not very different from what the serjeant is just mentioned to have made before and immediately ordered the centinel to be taken prisoner
so that by a strange reverse of fortune though not very uncommon in a military life the guard became the guarded
chapter xv
the conclusion of the foregoing adventure
besides the suspicion of sleep the lieutenant harboured another and worse doubt against the poor centinel and this was that of treachery for as he believed not one syllable of the apparition so he imagined the whole to be an invention formed only to impose upon him and that the fellow had in reality been bribed by northerton to let him escape
and this he imagined the rather as the fright appeared to him the more unnatural in one who had the character of as brave and bold a man as any in the regiment having been in several actions having received several wounds and in a word having behaved himself always like a good and valiant soldier
that the reader therefore may not conceive the least ill opinion of such a person we shall not delay a moment in rescuing his character from the imputation of this guilt
mr northerton then as we have before observed was fully satisfied with the glory which he had obtained from this action
he had perhaps seen or heard or guessed that envy is apt to attend fame
not that i would here insinuate that he was heathenishly inclined to believe in or to worship the goddess nemesis for in fact i am convinced he never heard of her name
he was besides of an active disposition and had a great antipathy to those close quarters in the castle of gloucester for which a justice of peace might possibly give him a billet
nor was he moreover free from some uneasy meditations on a certain wooden edifice which i forbear to name in conformity to the opinion of mankind who i think rather ought to honour than to be ashamed of this building as it is or at least might be made of more benefit to society than almost any other public erection
in a word to hint at no more reasons for his conduct mr northerton was desirous of departing that evening and nothing remained for him but to contrive the quomodo which appeared to be a matter of some difficulty
now this young gentleman though somewhat crooked in his morals was perfectly straight in his person which was extremely strong and well made
his face too was accounted handsome by the generality of women for it was broad and ruddy with tolerably good teeth
such charms did not fail making an impression on my landlady who had no little relish for this kind of beauty
she had indeed a real compassion for the young man and hearing from the surgeon that affairs were like to go ill with the volunteer she suspected they might hereafter wear no benign aspect with the ensign
having obtained therefore leave to make him a visit and finding him in a very melancholy mood which she considerably heightened by telling him there were scarce any hopes of the volunteer's life she proceeded to throw forth some hints which the other readily and eagerly taking up they soon came to a right understanding and it was at length agreed that the ensign should at a certain signal ascend the chimney which communicating very soon with that of the kitchen he might there again let himself down for which she would give him an opportunity by keeping the coast clear
but lest our readers of a different complexion should take this occasion of too hastily condemning all compassion as a folly and pernicious to society we think proper to mention another particular which might possibly have some little share in this action
the ensign happened to be at this time possessed of the sum of fifty pounds which did indeed belong to the whole company for the captain having quarrelled with his lieutenant had entrusted the payment of his company to the ensign
this money however he thought proper to deposit in my landlady's hand possibly by way of bail or security that he would hereafter appear and answer to the charge against him but whatever were the conditions certain it is that she had the money and the ensign his liberty
the reader may perhaps expect from the compassionate temper of this good woman that when she saw the poor centinel taken prisoner for a fact of which she knew him innocent she should immediately have interposed in his behalf but whether it was that she had already exhausted all her compassion in the abovementioned instance or that the features of this fellow though not very different from those of the ensign could not raise it i will not determine but far from being an advocate for the present prisoner she urged his guilt to his officer declaring with uplifted eyes and hands that she would not have had any concern in the escape of a murderer for all the world
everything was now once more quiet and most of the company returned again to their beds but the landlady either from the natural activity of her disposition or from her fear for her plate having no propensity to sleep prevailed with the officers as they were to march within little more than an hour to spend that time with her over a bowl of punch
jones had lain awake all this while and had heard great part of the hurry and bustle that had passed of which he had now some curiosity to know the particulars
he therefore applied to his bell which he rung at least twenty times without any effect for my landlady was in such high mirth with her company that no clapper could be heard there but her own and the drawer and chambermaid who were sitting together in the kitchen for neither durst he sit up nor she lie in bed alone the more they heard the bell ring the more they were frightened and as it were nailed down in their places
at last at a lucky interval of chat the sound reached the ears of our good landlady who presently sent forth her summons which both her servants instantly obeyed
joe says the mistress don't you hear the gentleman's bell ring
why don't you go upit is not my business answered the drawer to wait upon the chambersit is betty chambermaid'sif you come to that answered the maid it is not my business to wait upon gentlemen
i have done it indeed sometimes but the devil fetch me if ever i do again since you make your preambles about it the bell still ringing violently their mistress fell into a passion and swore if the drawer did not go up immediately she would turn him away that very morning
if you do madam says he i can't help it
i won't do another servant's business she then applied herself to the maid and endeavoured to prevail by gentle means but all in vain betty was as inflexible as joe
both insisted it was not their business and they would not do it
the lieutenant then fell a laughing and said come i will put an end to this contention and then turning to the servants commended them for their resolution in not giving up the point but added he was sure if one would consent to go the other would
to which proposal they both agreed in an instant and accordingly went up very lovingly and close together
when they were gone the lieutenant appeased the wrath of the landlady by satisfying her why they were both so unwilling to go alone
they returned soon after and acquainted their mistress that the sick gentleman was so far from being dead that he spoke as heartily as if he was well and that he gave his service to the captain and should be very glad of the favour of seeing him before he marched
the good lieutenant immediately complied with his desires and sitting down by his bedside acquainted him with the scene which had happened below concluding with his intentions to make an example of the centinel
upon this jones related to him the whole truth and earnestly begged him not to punish the poor soldier who i am confident says he is as innocent of the ensign's escape as he is of forging any lie or of endeavouring to impose on you  the lieutenant hesitated a few moments and then answered why as you have cleared the fellow of one part of the charge so it will be impossible to prove the other because he was not the only centinel
but i have a good mind to punish the rascal for being a coward
yet who knows what effect the terror of such an apprehension may have
and to say the truth he hath always behaved well against an enemy
come it is a good thing to see any sign of religion in these fellows so i promise you he shall be set at liberty when we march
but hark the general beats
my dear boy give me another buss
don't discompose nor hurry yourself but remember the christian doctrine of patience and i warrant you will soon be able to do yourself justice and to take an honourable revenge on the fellow who hath injured you the lieutenant then departed and jones endeavoured to compose himself to rest
book viii
containing about two days
chapter i
a wonderful long chapter concerning the marvellous being much the longest of all our introductory chapters
as we are now entering upon a book in which the course of our history will oblige us to relate some matters of a more strange and surprizing kind than any which have hitherto occurred it may not be amiss in the prolegomenous or introductory chapter to say something of that species of writing which is called the marvellous
to this we shall as well for the sake of ourselves as of others endeavour to set some certain bounds and indeed nothing can be more necessary as critics of different complexions are here apt to run into very different extremes for while some are with m dacier ready to allow that the same thing which is impossible may be yet probable others have so little historic or poetic faith that they believe nothing to be either possible or probable the like to which hath not occurred to their own observation
 by this word here and in most other parts of our work we mean   every reader in the world
 it is happy for m dacier that he was not an irishman
first then i think it may very reasonably be required of every writer that he keeps within the bounds of possibility and still remembers that what it is not possible for man to perform it is scarce possible for man to believe he did perform
this conviction perhaps gave birth to many stories of the antient heathen deities for most of them are of poetical original
the poet being desirous to indulge a wanton and extravagant imagination took refuge in that power of the extent of which his readers were no judges or rather which they imagined to be infinite and consequently they could not be shocked at any prodigies related of it
this hath been strongly urged in defence of homer's miracles and it is perhaps a defence not as mr pope would have it because ulysses told a set of foolish lies to the phaeacians who were a very dull nation but because the poet himself wrote to heathens to whom poetical fables were articles of faith
for my own part i must confess so compassionate is my temper i wish polypheme had confined himself to his milk diet and preserved his eye nor could ulysses be much more concerned than myself when his companions were turned into swine by circe who showed i think afterwards too much regard for man's flesh to be supposed capable of converting it into bacon
i wish likewise with all my heart that homer could have known the rule prescribed by horace to introduce supernatural agents as seldom as possible
we should not then have seen his gods coming on trivial errands and often behaving themselves so as not only to forfeit all title to respect but to become the objects of scorn and derision
a conduct which must have shocked the credulity of a pious and sagacious heathen and which could never have been defended unless by agreeing with a supposition to which i have been sometimes almost inclined that this most glorious poet as he certainly was had an intent to burlesque the superstitious faith of his own age and country
but i have rested too long on a doctrine which can be of no use to a christian writer for as he cannot introduce into his works any of that heavenly host which make a part of his creed so it is horrid puerility to search the heathen theology for any of those deities who have been long since dethroned from their immortality
lord shaftesbury observes that nothing is more cold than the invocation of a muse by a modern he might have added that nothing can be more absurd
a modern may with much more elegance invoke a ballad as some have thought homer did or a mug of ale with the author of hudibras which latter may perhaps have inspired much more poetry as well as prose than all the liquors of hippocrene or helicon
the only supernatural agents which can in any manner be allowed to us moderns are ghosts but of these i would advise an author to be extremely sparing
these are indeed like arsenic and other dangerous drugs in physic to be used with the utmost caution nor would i advise the introduction of them at all in those works or by those authors to which or to whom a horselaugh in the reader would be any great prejudice or mortification
as for elves and fairies and other such mummery i purposely omit the mention of them as i should be very unwilling to confine within any bounds those surprizing imaginations for whose vast capacity the limits of human nature are too narrow whose works are to be considered as a new creation and who have consequently just right to do what they will with their own
man therefore is the highest subject unless on very extraordinary occasions indeed which presents itself to the pen of our historian or of our poet and in relating his actions great care is to be taken that we do not exceed the capacity of the agent we describe
nor is possibility alone sufficient to justify us we must keep likewise within the rules of probability
it is i think the opinion of aristotle or if not it is the opinion of some wise man whose authority will be as weighty when it is as old that it is no excuse for a poet who relates what is incredible that the thing related is really matter of fact this may perhaps be allowed true with regard to poetry but it may be thought impracticable to extend it to the historian for he is obliged to record matters as he finds them though they may be of so extraordinary a nature as will require no small degree of historical faith to swallow them
such was the successless armament of xerxes described by herodotus or the successful expedition of alexander related by arrian
such of later years was the victory of agincourt obtained by harry the fifth or that of narva won by charles the twelfth of sweden
all which instances the more we reflect on them appear still the more astonishing
such facts however as they occur in the thread of the story nay indeed as they constitute the essential parts of it the historian is not only justifiable in recording as they really happened but indeed would be unpardonable should he omit or alter them
but there are other facts not of such consequence nor so necessary which though ever so well attested may nevertheless be sacrificed to oblivion in complacence to the scepticism of a reader
such is that memorable story of the ghost of george villiers which might with more propriety have been made a present of to dr drelincourt to have kept the ghost of mrs veale company at the head of his discourse upon death than have been introduced into so solemn a work as the history of the rebellion
to say the truth if the historian will confine himself to what really happened and utterly reject any circumstance which though never so well attested he must be well assured is false he will sometimes fall into the marvellous but never into the incredible
he will often raise the wonder and surprize of his reader but never that incredulous hatred mentioned by horace
it is by falling into fiction therefore that we generally offend against this rule of deserting probability which the historian seldom if ever quits till he forsakes his character and commences a writer of romance
in this however those historians who relate public transactions have the advantage of us who confine ourselves to scenes of private life
the credit of the former is by common notoriety supported for a long time and public records with the concurrent testimony of many authors bear evidence to their truth in future ages
thus a trajan and an antoninus a nero and a caligula have all met with the belief of posterity and no one doubts but that men so very good and so very bad were once the masters of mankind
but we who deal in private character who search into the most retired recesses and draw forth examples of virtue and vice from holes and corners of the world are in a more dangerous situation
as we have no public notoriety no concurrent testimony no records to support and corroborate what we deliver it becomes us to keep within the limits not only of possibility but of probability too and this more especially in painting what is greatly good and amiable
knavery and folly though never so exorbitant will more easily meet with assent for illnature adds great support and strength to faith
thus we may perhaps with little danger relate the history of fisher who having long owed his bread to the generosity of mr derby and having one morning received a considerable bounty from his hands yet in order to possess himself of what remained in his friend's scrutore concealed himself in a public office of the temple through which there was a passage into mr derby's chambers
here he overheard mr derby for many hours solacing himself at an entertainment which he that evening gave his friends and to which fisher had been invited
during all this time no tender no grateful reflections arose to restrain his purpose but when the poor gentleman had let his company out through the office fisher came suddenly from his lurkingplace and walking softly behind his friend into his chamber discharged a pistolball into his head
this may be believed when the bones of fisher are as rotten as his heart
nay perhaps it will be credited that the villain went two days afterwards with some young ladies to the play of hamlet and with an unaltered countenance heard one of the ladies who little suspected how near she was to the person cry out good god
if the man that murdered mr derby was now present  manifesting in this a more seared and callous conscience than even nero himself of whom we are told by suetonius that the consciousness of his guilt after the death of his mother became immediately intolerable and so continued nor could all the congratulations of the soldiers of the senate and the people allay the horrors of his conscience  but now on the other hand should i tell my reader that i had known a man whose penetrating genius had enabled him to raise a large fortune in a way where no beginning was chaulked out to him that he had done this with the most perfect preservation of his integrity and not only without the least injustice or injury to any one individual person but with the highest advantage to trade and a vast increase of the public revenue that he had expended one part of the income of this fortune in discovering a taste superior to most by works where the highest dignity was united with the purest simplicity and another part in displaying a degree of goodness superior to all men by acts of charity to objects whose only recommendations were their merits or their wants that he was most industrious in searching after merit in distress most eager to relieve it and then as careful perhaps too careful to conceal what he had done that his house his furniture his gardens his table his private hospitality and his public beneficence all denoted the mind from which they flowed and were all intrinsically rich and noble without tinsel or external ostentation that he filled every relation in life with the most adequate virtue that he was most piously religious to his creator most zealously loyal to his sovereign a most tender husband to his wife a kind relation a munificent patron a warm and firm friend a knowing and a chearful companion indulgent to his servants hospitable to his neighbours charitable to the poor and benevolent to all mankind
should i add to these the epithets of wise brave elegant and indeed every other amiable epithet in our language i might surely say        quis credet
nemo hercule
nemo       vel duo vel nemo  and yet i know a man who is all i have here described
but a single instance and i really know not such another is not sufficient to justify us while we are writing to thousands who never heard of the person nor of anything like him
such rarae aves should be remitted to the epitaph writer or to some poet who may condescend to hitch him in a distich or to slide him into a rhime with an air of carelessness and neglect without giving any offence to the reader
in the last place the actions should be such as may not only be within the compass of human agency and which human agents may probably be supposed to do but they should be likely for the very actors and characters themselves to have performed for what may be only wonderful and surprizing in one man may become improbable or indeed impossible when related of another
this last requisite is what the dramatic critics call conversation of character and it requires a very extraordinary degree of judgment and a most exact knowledge of human nature
it is admirably remarked by a most excellent writer that zeal can no more hurry a man to act in direct opposition to itself than a rapid stream can carry a boat against its own current
i will venture to say that for a man to act in direct contradiction to the dictates of his nature is if not impossible as improbable and as miraculous as anything which can well be conceived
should the best parts of the story of m antoninus be ascribed to nero or should the worst incidents of nero's life be imputed to antoninus what would be more shocking to belief than either instance
whereas both these being related of their proper agent constitute the truly marvellous
our modern authors of comedy have fallen almost universally into the error here hinted at their heroes generally are notorious rogues and their heroines abandoned jades during the first four acts but in the fifth the former become very worthy gentlemen and the latter women of virtue and discretion nor is the writer often so kind as to give himself the least trouble to reconcile or account for this monstrous change and incongruity
there is indeed no other reason to be assigned for it than because the play is drawing to a conclusion as if it was no less natural in a rogue to repent in the last act of a play than in the last of his life which we perceive to be generally the case at tyburn a place which might indeed close the scene of some comedies with much propriety as the heroes in these are most commonly eminent for those very talents which not only bring men to the gallows but enable them to make an heroic figure when they are there
within these few restrictions i think every writer may be permitted to deal as much in the wonderful as he pleases nay if he thus keeps within the rules of credibility the more he can surprize the reader the more he will engage his attention and the more he will charm him
as a genius of the highest rank observes in his fifth chapter of the bathos the great art of all poetry is to mix truth with fiction in order to join the credible with the surprizing  for though every good author will confine himself within the bounds of probability it is by no means necessary that his characters or his incidents should be trite common or vulgar such as happen in every street or in every house or which may be met with in the home articles of a newspaper
nor must he be inhibited from showing many persons and things which may possibly have never fallen within the knowledge of great part of his readers
if the writer strictly observes the rules abovementioned he hath discharged his part and is then intitled to some faith from his reader who is indeed guilty of critical infidelity if he disbelieves him
for want of a portion of such faith i remember the character of a young lady of quality which was condemned on the stage for being unnatural by the unanimous voice of a very large assembly of clerks and apprentices though it had the previous suffrages of many ladies of the first rank one of whom very eminent for her understanding declared it was the picture of half the young people of her acquaintance
chapter ii
in which the landlady pays a visit to mr jones
when jones had taken leave of his friend the lieutenant he endeavoured to close his eyes but all in vain his spirits were too lively and wakeful to be lulled to sleep
so having amused or rather tormented himself with the thoughts of his sophia till it was open daylight he called for some tea upon which occasion my landlady herself vouchsafed to pay him a visit
this was indeed the first time she had seen him or at least had taken any notice of him but as the lieutenant had assured her that he was certainly some young gentleman of fashion she now determined to show him all the respect in her power for to speak truly this was one of those houses where gentlemen to use the language of advertisements meet with civil treatment for their money
she had no sooner begun to make his tea than she likewise began to discoursela
sir said she i think it is great pity that such a pretty young gentleman should undervalue himself so as to go about with these soldier fellows
they call themselves gentlemen i warrant you but as my first husband used to say they should remember it is we that pay them
and to be sure it is very hard upon us to be obliged to pay them and to keep 'um too as we publicans are
i had twenty of 'um last night besides officers nay for matter o' that i had rather have the soldiers than officers for nothing is ever good enough for those sparks and i am sure if you was to see the bills la
sir it is nothing
i have had less trouble i warrant you with a good squire's family where we take forty or fifty shillings of a night besides horses
and yet i warrants me there is narrow a one of those officer fellows but looks upon himself to be as good as arrow a squire of  a year
to be sure it doth me good to hear their men run about after 'um crying your honour and your honour
marry come up with such honour and an ordinary at a shilling a head
then there's such swearing among 'um to be sure it frightens me out o' my wits i thinks nothing can ever prosper with such wicked people
and here one of 'um has used you in so barbarous a manner
i thought indeed how well the rest would secure him they all hang together for if you had been in danger of death which i am glad to see you are not it would have been all as one to such wicked people
they would have let the murderer go
laud have mercy upon 'um i would not have such a sin to answer for for the whole world
but though you are likely with the blessing to recover there is laa for him yet and if you will employ lawyer small i darest be sworn he'll make the fellow fly the country for him though perhaps he'll have fled the country before for it is here today and gone tomorrow with such chaps
i hope however you will learn more wit for the future and return back to your friends i warrant they are all miserable for your loss and if they was but to know what had happenedla my seeming
i would not for the world they should
come come we know very well what all the matter is but if one won't another will so pretty a gentleman need never want a lady
i am sure if i was you i would see the finest she that ever wore a head hanged before i would go for a soldier for hernay don't blush so for indeed he did to a violent degree
why you thought sir i knew nothing of the matter i warrant you about madam sophiahow says jones starting up do you know my sophiado i
ay marry cries the landlady many's the time hath she lain in this housewith her aunt i suppose  says jones
why there it is now cries the landlady
ay ay ay i know the old lady very well
and a sweet young creature is madam sophia that's the truth on'ta sweet creature cries jones o heavens    angels are painted fair to look like her
there's in her all that we believe of heav'n   amazing brightness purity and truth   eternal joy and everlasting love
and could i ever have imagined that you had known my sophiai wish says the landlady you knew half so much of her
what would you have given to have sat by her bedside
what a delicious neck she hath
her lovely limbs have stretched themselves in that very bed you now lie inhere cries jones hath sophia ever laid hereay ay here there in that very bed says the landlady where i wish you had her this moment and she may wish so too for anything i know to the contrary for she hath mentioned your name to meha cries he did she ever mention her poor jones
you flatter me now i can never believe so muchwhy then answered she as i hope to be saved and may the devil fetch me if i speak a syllable more than the truth i have heard her mention mr jones but in a civil and modest way i confess yet i could perceive she thought a great deal more than she saido my dear woman cries jones her thoughts of me i shall never be worthy of
oh she is all gentleness kindness goodness
why was such a rascal as i born ever to give her soft bosom a moment's uneasiness
why am i cursed
i who would undergo all the plagues and miseries which any daemon ever invented for mankind to procure her any good nay torture itself could not be misery to me did i but know that she was happywhy look you there now says the landlady i told her you was a constant lovierbut pray madam tell me when or where you knew anything of me for i never was here before nor do i remember ever to have seen younor is it possible you should answered she for you was a little thing when i had you in my lap at the squire'show the squire's says jones what do you know that great and good mr allworthy thenyes marry do i says she who in the country doth notthe fame of his goodness indeed answered jones must have extended farther than this but heaven only can know himcan know that benevolence which it copied from itself and sent upon earth as its own pattern
mankind are as ignorant of such divine goodness as they are unworthy of it but none so unworthy of it as myself
i who was raised by him to such a height taken in as you must well know a poor baseborn child adopted by him and treated as his own son to dare by my follies to disoblige him to draw his vengeance upon me
yes i deserve it all for i will never be so ungrateful as ever to think he hath done an act of injustice by me
no i deserve to be turned out of doors as i am
and now madam says he i believe you will not blame me for turning soldier especially with such a fortune as this in my pocket at which words he shook a purse which had but very little in it and which still appeared to the landlady to have less
my good landlady was according to vulgar phrase struck all of a heap by this relation
she answered coldly that to be sure people were the best judges what was most proper for their circumstances
but hark says she i think i hear somebody call
coming
coming
the devil's in all our volk nobody hath any ears
i must go downstairs if you want any more breakfast the maid will come up
coming at which words without taking any leave she flung out of the room for the lower sort of people are very tenacious of respect and though they are contented to give this gratis to persons of quality yet they never confer it on those of their own order without taking care to be well paid for their pains
chapter iii
in which the surgeon makes his second appearance
before we proceed any farther that the reader may not be mistaken in imagining the landlady knew more than she did nor surprized that she knew so much it may be necessary to inform him that the lieutenant had acquainted her that the name of sophia had been the occasion of the quarrel and as for the rest of her knowledge the sagacious reader will observe how she came by it in the preceding scene
great curiosity was indeed mixed with her virtues and she never willingly suffered any one to depart from her house without enquiring as much as possible into their names families and fortunes
she was no sooner gone than jones instead of animadverting on her behaviour reflected that he was in the same bed which he was informed had held his dear sophia
this occasioned a thousand fond and tender thoughts which we would dwell longer upon did we not consider that such kind of lovers will make a very inconsiderable part of our readers
in this situation the surgeon found him when he came to dress his wound
the doctor perceiving upon examination that his pulse was disordered and hearing that he had not slept declared that he was in great danger for he apprehended a fever was coming on which he would have prevented by bleeding but jones would not submit declaring he would lose no more blood and doctor says he if you will be so kind only to dress my head i have no doubt of being well in a day or two  i wish answered the surgeon i could assure your being well in a month or two
well indeed
no no people are not so soon well of such contusions but sir i am not at this time of day to be instructed in my operations by a patient and i insist on making a revulsion before i dress you  jones persisted obstinately in his refusal and the doctor at last yielded telling him at the same time that he would not be answerable for the ill consequence and hoped he would do him the justice to acknowledge that he had given him a contrary advice which the patient promised he would
the doctor retired into the kitchen where addressing himself to the landlady he complained bitterly of the undutiful behaviour of his patient who would not be blooded though he was in a fever
it is an eating fever then says the landlady for he hath devoured two swinging buttered toasts this morning for breakfast  very likely says the doctor i have known people eat in a fever and it is very easily accounted for because the acidity occasioned by the febrile matter may stimulate the nerves of the diaphragm and thereby occasion a craving which will not be easily distinguishable from a natural appetite but the aliment will not be concreted nor assimilated into chyle and so will corrode the vascular orifices and thus will aggravate the febrific symptoms
indeed i think the gentleman in a very dangerous way and if he is not blooded i am afraid will die  every man must die some time or other answered the good woman it is no business of mine
i hope doctor you would not have me hold him while you bleed him
but hark'ee a word in your ear i would advise you before you proceed too far to take care who is to be your paymaster  paymaster said the doctor staring why i've a gentleman under my hands have i not  i imagined so as well as you said the landlady but as my first husband used to say everything is not what it looks to be
he is an arrant scrub i assure you
however take no notice that i mentioned anything to you of the matter but i think people in business oft always to let one another know such things  and have i suffered such a fellow as this cries the doctor in a passion to instruct me
shall i hear my practice insulted by one who will not pay me
i am glad i have made this discovery in time
i will see now whether he will be blooded or no he then immediately went upstairs and flinging open the door of the chamber with much violence awaked poor jones from a very sound nap into which he was fallen and what was still worse from a delicious dream concerning sophia
will you be blooded or no cries the doctor in a rage
i have told you my resolution already answered jones and i wish with all my heart you had taken my answer for you have awaked me out of the sweetest sleep which i ever had in my life  ay ay cries the doctor many a man hath dozed away his life
sleep is not always good no more than food but remember i demand of you for the last time will you be bloodedi answer you for the last time said jones i will notthen i wash my hands of you  cries the doctor and i desire you to pay me for the trouble i have had already
two journeys at s
each two dressings at s
more and half a crown for phlebotomyi hope said jones you don't intend to leave me in this conditionindeed but i shall said the other
then said jones you have used me rascally and i will not pay you a farthingvery well cries the doctor the first loss is the best
what a pox did my landlady mean by sending for me to such vagabonds at which words he flung out of the room and his patient turning himself about soon recovered his sleep but his dream was unfortunately gone
chapter iv
in which is introduced one of the pleasantest barbers that was ever recorded in history the barber of bagdad or he in don quixote not excepted
the clock had now struck five when jones awaked from a nap of seven hours so much refreshed and in such perfect health and spirits that he resolved to get up and dress himself for which purpose he unlocked his portmanteau and took out clean linen and a suit of cloaths but first he slipt on a frock and went down into the kitchen to bespeak something that might pacify certain tumults he found rising within his stomach
meeting the landlady he accosted her with great civility and asked what he could have for dinnerfor dinner says she it is an odd time a day to think about dinner
there is nothing drest in the house and the fire is almost outwell but says he i must have something to eat and it is almost indifferent to me what for to tell you the truth i was never more hungry in my lifethen  says she i believe there is a piece of cold buttock and carrot which will fit younothing better answered jones but i should be obliged to you if you would let it be fried to which the landlady consented and said smiling she was glad to see him so well recovered for the sweetness of our heroe's temper was almost irresistible besides she was really no illhumoured woman at the bottom but she loved money so much that she hated everything which had the semblance of poverty
jones now returned in order to dress himself while his dinner was preparing and was according to his orders attended by the barber
this barber who went by the name of little benjamin was a fellow of great oddity and humour which had frequently let him into small inconveniencies such as slaps in the face kicks in the breech broken bones c for every one doth not understand a jest and those who do are often displeased with being themselves the subjects of it
this vice was however incurable in him and though he had often smarted for it yet if ever he conceived a joke he was certain to be delivered of it without the least respect of persons time or place
he had a great many other particularities in his character which i shall not mention as the reader will himself very easily perceive them on his farther acquaintance with this extraordinary person
jones being impatient to be drest for a reason which may be easily imagined thought the shaver was very tedious in preparing his suds and begged him to make haste to which the other answered with much gravity for he never discomposed his muscles on any account festina lente is a proverb which i learned long before i ever touched a razori find friend you are a scholar replied jones
a poor one said the barber non omnia possumus omnesagain  said jones i fancy you are good at capping versesexcuse me sir said the barber non tanto me dignor honore and then proceeding to his operation sir said he since i have dealt in suds i could never discover more than two reasons for shaving the one is to get a beard and the other to get rid of one
i conjecture sir it may not be long since you shaved from the former of these motives
upon my word you have had good success for one may say of your beard that it is tondenti graviori conjecture says jones that thou art a very comical fellowyou mistake me widely sir said the barber i am too much addicted to the study of philosophy hinc illae lacrymae sir that's my misfortune
too much learning hath been my ruinindeed says jones i confess friend you have more learning than generally belongs to your trade but i can't see how it can have injured youalas
sir answered the shaver my father disinherited me for it
he was a dancingmaster and because i could read before i could dance he took an aversion to me and left every farthing among his other childrenwill you please to have your templeso la
i ask your pardon i fancy there is hiatus in manuscriptis
i heard you was going to the wars but i find it was a mistakewhy do you conclude so says jones
sure sir answered the barber you are too wise a man to carry a broken head thither for that would be carrying coals to newcastle  upon my word cries jones thou art a very odd fellow and i like thy humour extremely i shall be very glad if thou wilt come to me after dinner and drink a glass with me i long to be better acquainted with thee  o dear sir said the barber i can do you twenty times as great a favour if you will accept of itwhat is that my friend cries jones
why i will drink a bottle with you if you please for i dearly love goodnature and as you have found me out to be a comical fellow so i have no skill in physiognomy if you are not one of the bestnatured gentlemen in the universe jones now walked downstairs neatly drest and perhaps the fair adonis was not a lovelier figure and yet he had no charms for my landlady for as that good woman did not resemble venus at all in her person so neither did she in her taste
happy had it been for nanny the chambermaid if she had seen with the eyes of her mistress for that poor girl fell so violently in love with jones in five minutes that her passion afterwards cost her many a sigh
this nanny was extremely pretty and altogether as coy for she had refused a drawer and one or two young farmers in the neighbourhood but the bright eyes of our heroe thawed all her ice in a moment
when jones returned to the kitchen his cloth was not yet laid nor indeed was there any occasion it should his dinner remaining in statu quo as did the fire which was to dress it
this disappointment might have put many a philosophical temper into a passion but it had no such effect on jones
he only gave the landlady a gentle rebuke saying since it was so difficult to get it heated he would eat the beef cold but now the good woman whether moved by compassion or by shame or by whatever other motive i cannot tell first gave her servants a round scold for disobeying the orders which she had never given and then bidding the drawer lay a napkin in the sun she set about the matter in good earnest and soon accomplished it
this sun into which jones was now conducted was truly named as lucus a non lucendo for it was an apartment into which the sun had scarce ever looked
it was indeed the worst room in the house and happy was it for jones that it was so
however he was now too hungry to find any fault but having once satisfied his appetite he ordered the drawer to carry a bottle of wine into a better room and expressed some resentment at having been shown into a dungeon
the drawer having obeyed his commands he was after some time attended by the barber who would not indeed have suffered him to wait so long for his company had he not been listening in the kitchen to the landlady who was entertaining a circle that she had gathered round her with the history of poor jones part of which she had extracted from his own lips and the other part was her own ingenious composition for she said he was a poor parish boy taken into the house of squire allworthy where he was bred up as an apprentice and now turned out of doors for his misdeeds particularly for making love to his young mistress and probably for robbing the house for how else should he come by the little money he hath and this says she is your gentleman forsootha servant of squire allworthy says the barber what's his namewhy he told me his name was jones  says she perhaps he goes by a wrong name
nay and he told me too that the squire had maintained him as his own son thof he had quarrelled with him nowand if his name be jones he told you the truth said the barber for i have relations who live in that country nay and some people say he is his sonwhy doth he not go by the name of his fatheri can't tell that said the barber many people's sons don't go by the name of their fathernay  said the landlady if i thought he was a gentleman's son thof he was a byeblow i should behave to him in another guess manner for many of these byeblows come to be great men and as my poor first husband used to say never affront any customer that's a gentleman    chapter v  a dialogue between mr jones and the barber
this conversation passed partly while jones was at dinner in his dungeon and partly while he was expecting the barber in the parlour
and as soon as it was ended mr benjamin as we have said attended him and was very kindly desired to sit down
jones then filling out a glass of wine drank his health by the appellation of doctissime tonsorum
ago tibi gratias domine said the barber and then looking very steadfastly at jones he said with great gravity and with a seeming surprize as if he had recollected a face he had seen before sir may i crave the favour to know if your name is not jones to which the other answered that it wasproh deum atque hominum fidem says the barber how strangely things come to pass
mr jones i am your most obedient servant
i find you do not know me which indeed is no wonder since you never saw me but once and then you was very young
pray sir how doth the good squire allworthy
how doth ille optimus omnium patronusi find said jones you do indeed know me but i have not the like happiness of recollecting youi do not wonder at that cries benjamin but i am surprized i did not know you sooner for you are not in the least altered
and pray sir may i without offence enquire whither you are travelling this wayfill the glass mr barber said jones and ask no more questionsnay sir answered benjamin i would not be troublesome and i hope you don't think me a man of an impertinent curiosity for that is a vice which nobody can lay to my charge but i ask pardon for when a gentleman of your figure travels without his servants we may suppose him to be as we say in casu incognito and perhaps i ought not to have mentioned your namei own says jones i did not expect to have been so well known in this country as i find i am yet for particular reasons i shall be obliged to you if you will not mention my name to any other person till i am gone from hencepauca verba answered the barber and i wish no other here knew you but myself for some people have tongues but i promise you i can keep a secret
my enemies will allow me that virtueand yet that is not the characteristic of your profession mr barber  answered jones
alas
sir replied benjamin non si male nunc et olim sic erit
i was not born nor bred a barber i assure you
i have spent most of my time among gentlemen and though i say it i understand something of gentility
and if you had thought me as worthy of your confidence as you have some other people i should have shown you i could have kept a secret better
i should not have degraded your name in a public kitchen for indeed sir some people have not used you well for besides making a public proclamation of what you told them of a quarrel between yourself and squire allworthy they added lies of their own things which i knew to be liesyou surprize me greatly cries jones
upon my word sir answered benjamin i tell the truth and i need not tell you my landlady was the person
i am sure it moved me to hear the story and i hope it is all false for i have a great respect for you i do assure you i have and have had ever since the goodnature you showed to black george which was talked of all over the country and i received more than one letter about it
indeed it made you beloved by everybody
you will pardon me therefore for it was real concern at what i heard made me ask many questions for i have no impertinent curiosity about me but i love goodnature and thence became amoris abundantia erga te  every profession of friendship easily gains credit with the miserable it is no wonder therefore if jones who besides his being miserable was extremely openhearted very readily believed all the professions of benjamin and received him into his bosom
the scraps of latin some of which benjamin applied properly enough though it did not savour of profound literature seemed yet to indicate something superior to a common barber and so indeed did his whole behaviour
jones therefore believed the truth of what he had said as to his original and education and at length after much entreaty he said since you have heard my friend so much of my affairs and seem so desirous to know the truth if you will have patience to hear it i will inform you of the wholepatience cries benjamin that i will if the chapter was never so long and i am very much obliged to you for the honour you do me  jones now began and related the whole history forgetting only a circumstance or two namely everything which passed on that day in which he had fought with thwackum and ended with his resolution to go to sea till the rebellion in the north had made him change his purpose and had brought him to the place where he then was
little benjamin who had been all attention never once interrupted the narrative but when it was ended he could not help observing that there must be surely something more invented by his enemies and told mr allworthy against him or so good a man would never have dismissed one he had loved so tenderly in such a manner
to which jones answered he doubted not but such villanous arts had been made use of to destroy him  and surely it was scarce possible for any one to have avoided making the same remark with the barber who had not indeed heard from jones one single circumstance upon which he was condemned for his actions were not now placed in those injurious lights in which they had been misrepresented to allworthy nor could he mention those many false accusations which had been from time to time preferred against him to allworthy for with none of these he was himself acquainted
he had likewise as we have observed omitted many material facts in his present relation
upon the whole indeed everything now appeared in such favourable colours to jones that malice itself would have found it no easy matter to fix any blame upon him
not that jones desired to conceal or to disguise the truth nay he would have been more unwilling to have suffered any censure to fall on mr allworthy for punishing him than on his own actions for deserving it but in reality so it happened and so it always will happen for let a man be never so honest the account of his own conduct will in spite of himself be so very favourable that his vices will come purified through his lips and like foul liquors well strained will leave all their foulness behind
for though the facts themselves may appear yet so different will be the motives circumstances and consequences when a man tells his own story and when his enemy tells it that we scarce can recognise the facts to be one and the same
though the barber had drank down this story with greedy ears he was not yet satisfied
there was a circumstance behind which his curiosity cold as it was most eagerly longed for
jones had mentioned the fact of his amour and of his being the rival of blifil but had cautiously concealed the name of the young lady
the barber therefore after some hesitation and many hums and hahs at last begged leave to crave the name of the lady who appeared to be the principal cause of all this mischief
jones paused a moment and then said since i have trusted you with so much and since i am afraid her name is become too publick already on this occasion i will not conceal it from you
her name is sophia western  proh deum atque hominum fidem
squire western hath a daughter grown a womanay and such a woman cries jones that the world cannot match
no eye ever saw anything so beautiful but that is her least excellence
such sense
such goodness
oh i could praise her for ever and yet should omit half her virtuesmr western a daughter grown up cries the barber i remember the father a boy well tempus edax rerum  the wine being now at an end the barber pressed very eagerly to be his bottle but jones absolutely refused saying he had already drank more than he ought and that he now chose to retire to his room where he wished he could procure himself a booka book cries benjamin what book would you have
latin or english
i have some curious books in both languages such as erasmi colloquia ovid de tristibus gradus ad parnassum and in english i have several of the best books though some of them are a little torn but i have a great part of stowe's chronicle the sixth volume of pope's homer the third volume of the spectator the second volume of echard's roman history the craftsman robinson crusoe thomas a kempis and two volumes of tom brown's works  those last cries jones are books i never saw so if you please lend me one of those volumes the barber assured him he would be highly entertained for he looked upon the author to have been one of the greatest wits that ever the nation produced
he then stepped to his house which was hard by and immediately returned after which the barber having received very strict injunctions of secrecy from jones and having sworn inviolably to maintain it they separated the barber went home and jones retired to his chamber
chapter vi
in which more of the talents of mr benjamin will appear as well as who this extraordinary person was
in the morning jones grew a little uneasy at the desertion of his surgeon as he apprehended some inconvenience or even danger might attend the not dressing his wound he enquired of the drawer what other surgeons were to be met with in that neighbourhood
the drawer told him there was one not far off but he had known him often refuse to be concerned after another had been sent before him but sir  says he if you will take my advice there is not a man in the kingdom can do your business better than the barber who was with you last night
we look upon him to be one of the ablest men at a cut in all this neighbourhood
for though he hath not been her above three months he hath done several great cures  the drawer was presently dispatched for little benjamin who being acquainted in what capacity he was wanted prepared himself accordingly and attended but with so different an air and aspect from that which he wore when his basin was under his arm that he could scarce be known to be the same person
so tonsor says jones i find you have more trades than one how came you not to inform me of this last nighta surgeon answered benjamin with great gravity is a profession not a trade
the reason why i did not acquaint you last night that i professed this art was that i then concluded you was under the hands of another gentleman and i never love to interfere with my brethren in their business
ars omnibus communis
but now sir if you please i will inspect your head and when i see into your skull i will give my opinion of your case  jones had no great faith in this new professor however he suffered him to open the bandage and to look at his wound which as soon as he had done benjamin began to groan and shake his head violently
upon which jones in a peevish manner bid him not play the fool but tell him in what condition he found him
shall i answer you as a surgeon or a friend said benjamin
as a friend and seriously said jones
why then upon my soul cries benjamin it would require a great deal of art to keep you from being well after a very few dressings and if you will suffer me to apply some salve of mine i will answer for the success jones gave his consent and the plaister was applied accordingly
there sir cries benjamin now i will if you please resume my former self but a man is obliged to keep up some dignity in his countenance whilst he is performing these operations or the world will not submit to be handled by him
you can't imagine sir of how much consequence a grave aspect is to a grave character
a barber may make you laugh but a surgeon ought rather to make you cry  mr barber or mr surgeon or mr barbersurgeon said jones
o dear sir answered benjamin interrupting him infandum regina jubes renovare dolorem
you recall to my mind that cruel separation of the united fraternities so much to the prejudice of both bodies as all separations must be according to the old adage vis unita fortior which to be sure there are not wanting some of one or of the other fraternity who are able to construe
what a blow was this to me who unite both in my own person well by whatever name you please to be called continued jones you certainly are one of the oddest most comical fellows i ever met with and must have something very surprizing in your story which you must confess i have a right to heari do confess it answered benjamin and will very readily acquaint you with it when you have sufficient leisure for i promise you it will require a good deal of time jones told him he could never be more at leisure than at present
well then said benjamin i will obey you but first i will fasten the door that none may interrupt us he did so and then advancing with a solemn air to jones said i must begin by telling you sir that you yourself have been the greatest enemy i ever had jones was a little startled at this sudden declaration
i your enemy sir says he with much amazement and some sternness in his look
nay be not angry said benjamin for i promise you i am not
you are perfectly innocent of having intended me any wrong for you was then an infant but i shall i believe unriddle all this the moment i mention my name
did you never hear sir of one partridge who had the honour of being reputed your father and the misfortune of being ruined by that honour i have indeed heard of that partridge says jones and have always believed myself to be his son well sir answered benjamin i am that partridge but i here absolve you from all filial duty for i do assure you you are no son of mine how replied jones and is it possible that a false suspicion should have drawn all the ill consequences upon you with which i am too well acquainted it is possible cries benjamin for it is so but though it is natural enough for men to hate even the innocent causes of their sufferings yet i am of a different temper
i have loved you ever since i heard of your behaviour to black george as i told you and i am convinced from this extraordinary meeting that you are born to make me amends for all i have suffered on that account
besides i dreamt the night before i saw you that i stumbled over a stool without hurting myself which plainly showed me something good was towards me and last night i dreamt again that i rode behind you on a milkwhite mare which is a very excellent dream and betokens much good fortune which i am resolved to pursue unless you have the cruelty to deny me  i should be very glad mr partridge answered jones to have it in my power to make you amends for your sufferings on my account though at present i see no likelihood of it however i assure you i will deny you nothing which is in my power to grant  it is in your power sure enough replied benjamin for i desire nothing more than leave to attend you in this expedition
nay i have so entirely set my heart upon it that if you should refuse me you will kill both a barber and a surgeon in one breath  jones answered smiling that he should be very sorry to be the occasion of so much mischief to the public
he then advanced many prudential reasons in order to dissuade benjamin whom we shall hereafter call partridge from his purpose but all were in vain
partridge relied strongly on his dream of the milkwhite mare
besides sir says he i promise you i have as good an inclination to the cause as any man can possibly have and go i will whether you admit me to go in your company or not  jones who was as much pleased with partridge as partridge could be with him and who had not consulted his own inclination but the good of the other in desiring him to stay behind when he found his friend so resolute at last gave his consent but then recollecting himself he said perhaps mr partridge you think i shall be able to support you but i really am not and then taking out his purse he told out nine guineas which he declared were his whole fortune
partridge answered that his dependence was only on his future favour for he was thoroughly convinced he would shortly have enough in his power
at present sir said he i believe i am rather the richer man of the two but all i have is at your service and at your disposal
i insist upon your taking the whole and i beg only to attend you in the quality of your servant nil desperandum est teucro duce et auspice teucro but to this generous proposal concerning the money jones would by no means submit
it was resolved to set out the next morning when a difficulty arose concerning the baggage for the portmanteau of mr jones was too large to be carried without a horse
if i may presume to give my advice says partridge this portmanteau with everything in it except a few shirts should be left behind
those i shall be easily able to carry for you and the rest of your cloaths will remain very safe locked up in my house  this method was no sooner proposed than agreed to and then the barber departed in order to prepare everything for his intended expedition
chapter vii
containing better reasons than any which have yet appeared for the conduct of partridge an apology for the weakness of jones and some further anecdotes concerning my landlady
though partridge was one of the most superstitious of men he would hardly perhaps have desired to accompany jones on his expedition merely from the omens of the jointstool and white mare if his prospect had been no better than to have shared the plunder gained in the field of battle
in fact when partridge came to ruminate on the relation he had heard from jones he could not reconcile to himself that mr allworthy should turn his son for so he most firmly believed him to be out of doors for any reason which he had heard assigned
he concluded therefore that the whole was a fiction and that jones of whom he had often from his correspondents heard the wildest character had in reality run away from his father
it came into his head therefore that if he could prevail with the young gentleman to return back to his father he should by that means render a service to allworthy which would obliterate all his former anger nay indeed he conceived that very anger was counterfeited and that allworthy had sacrificed him to his own reputation
and this suspicion indeed he well accounted for from the tender behaviour of that excellent man to the foundling child from his great severity to partridge who knowing himself to be innocent could not conceive that any other should think him guilty lastly from the allowance which he had privately received long after the annuity had been publickly taken from him and which he looked upon as a kind of smartmoney or rather by way of atonement for injustice for it is very uncommon i believe for men to ascribe the benefactions they receive to pure charity when they can possibly impute them to any other motive
if he could by any means therefore persuade the young gentleman to return home he doubted not but that he should again be received into the favour of allworthy and well rewarded for his pains nay and should be again restored to his native country a restoration which ulysses himself never wished more heartily than poor partridge
as for jones he was well satisfied with the truth of what the other had asserted and believed that partridge had no other inducements but love to him and zeal for the cause a blameable want of caution and diffidence in the veracity of others in which he was highly worthy of censure
to say the truth there are but two ways by which men become possessed of this excellent quality
the one is from long experience and the other is from nature which last i presume is often meant by genius or great natural parts and it is infinitely the better of the two not only as we are masters of it much earlier in life but as it is much more infallible and conclusive for a man who hath been imposed on by ever so many may still hope to find others more honest whereas he who receives certain necessary admonitions from within that this is impossible must have very little understanding indeed if he ever renders himself liable to be once deceived
as jones had not this gift from nature he was too young to have gained it by experience for at the diffident wisdom which is to be acquired this way we seldom arrive till very late in life which is perhaps the reason why some old men are apt to despise the understandings of all those who are a little younger than themselves
jones spent most part of the day in the company of a new acquaintance
this was no other than the landlord of the house or rather the husband of the landlady
he had but lately made his descent downstairs after a long fit of the gout in which distemper he was generally confined to his room during one half of the year and during the rest he walked about the house smoaked his pipe and drank his bottle with his friends without concerning himself in the least with any kind of business
he had been bred as they call it a gentleman that is bred up to do nothing and had spent a very small fortune which he inherited from an industrious farmer his uncle in hunting horseracing and cockfighting and had been married by my landlady for certain purposes which he had long since desisted from answering for which she hated him heartily
but as he was a surly kind of fellow so she contented herself with frequently upbraiding him by disadvantageous comparisons with her first husband whose praise she had eternally in her mouth and as she was for the most part mistress of the profit so she was satisfied to take upon herself the care and government of the family and after a long successless struggle to suffer her husband to be master of himself
in the evening when jones retired to his room a small dispute arose between this fond couple concerning himwhat says the wife you have been tippling with the gentleman i seeyes answered the husband we have cracked a bottle together and a very gentlemanlike man he is and hath a very pretty notion of horseflesh
indeed he is young and hath not seen much of the world for i believe he hath been at very few horseracesoho
he is one of your order is he  replies the landlady he must be a gentleman to be sure if he is a horseracer
the devil fetch such gentry
i am sure i wish i had never seen any of them
i have reason to love horseracers trulythat you have says the husband for i was one you knowyes  answered she you are a pure one indeed
as my first husband used to say i may put all the good i have ever got by you in my eyes and see never the worsedn your first husband cries he
don't dn a better man than yourself answered the wife if he had been alive you durst not have done itthen you think says he i have not so much courage as yourself for you have dn'd him often in my hearingif i did says she i have repented of it many's the good time and oft
and if he was so good to forgive me a word spoken in haste or so it doth not become such a one as you to twitter me
he was a husband to me he was and if ever i did make use of an ill word or so in a passion i never called him rascal i should have told a lie if i had called him rascal much more she said but not in his hearing for having lighted his pipe he staggered off as fast as he could
we shall therefore transcribe no more of her speech as it approached still nearer and nearer to a subject too indelicate to find any place in this history
early in the morning partridge appeared at the bedside of jones ready equipped for the journey with his knapsack at his back
this was his own workmanship for besides his other trades he was no indifferent taylor
he had already put up his whole stock of linen in it consisting of four shirts to which he now added eight for mr jones and then packing up the portmanteau he was departing with it towards his own house but was stopt in his way by the landlady who refused to suffer any removals till after the payment of the reckoning
the landlady was as we have said absolute governess in these regions it was therefore necessary to comply with her rules so the bill was presently writ out which amounted to a much larger sum than might have been expected from the entertainment which jones had met with
but here we are obliged to disclose some maxims which publicans hold to be the grand mysteries of their trade
the first is if they have anything good in their house which indeed very seldom happens to produce it only to persons who travel with great equipages
dly to charge the same for the very worst provisions as if they were the best
and lastly if any of their guests call but for little to make them pay a double price for everything they have so that the amount by the head may be much the same
the bill being made and discharged jones set forward with partridge carrying his knapsack nor did the landlady condescend to wish him a good journey for this was it seems an inn frequented by people of fashion and i know not whence it is but all those who get their livelihood by people of fashion contract as much insolence to the rest of mankind as if they really belonged to that rank themselves
chapter viii
jones arrives at gloucester and goes to the bell the character of that house and of a pettyfogger which he there meets with
mr jones and partridge or little benjamin which epithet of little was perhaps given him ironically he being in reality near six feet high having left their last quarters in the manner before described travelled on to gloucester without meeting any adventure worth relating
being arrived here they chose for their house of entertainment the sign of the bell an excellent house indeed and which i do most seriously recommend to every reader who shall visit this antient city
the master of it is brother to the great preacher whitefield but is absolutely untainted with the pernicious principles of methodism or of any other heretical sect
he is indeed a very honest plain man and in my opinion not likely to create any disturbance either in church or state
his wife hath i believe had much pretension to beauty and is still a very fine woman
her person and deportment might have made a shining figure in the politest assemblies but though she must be conscious of this and many other perfections she seems perfectly contented with and resigned to that state of life to which she is called and this resignation is entirely owing to the prudence and wisdom of her temper for she is at present as free from any methodistical notions as her husband i say at present for she freely confesses that her brother's documents made at first some impression upon her and that she had put herself to the expense of a long hood in order to attend the extraordinary emotions of the spirit but having found during an experiment of three weeks no emotions she says worth a farthing she very wisely laid by her hood and abandoned the sect
to be concise she is a very friendly goodnatured woman and so industrious to oblige that the guests must be of a very morose disposition who are not extremely well satisfied in her house
mrs whitefield happened to be in the yard when jones and his attendant marched in
her sagacity soon discovered in the air of our heroe something which distinguished him from the vulgar
she ordered her servants therefore immediately to show him into a room and presently afterwards invited him to dinner with herself which invitation he very thankfully accepted for indeed much less agreeable company than that of mrs whitefield and a much worse entertainment than she had provided would have been welcome after so long fasting and so long a walk
besides mr jones and the good governess of the mansion there sat down at table an attorney of salisbury indeed the very same who had brought the news of mrs blifil's death to mr allworthy and whose name which i think we did not before mention was dowling there was likewise present another person who stiled himself a lawyer and who lived somewhere near linlinch in somersetshire
this fellow i say stiled himself a lawyer but was indeed a most vile pettyfogger without sense or knowledge of any kind one of those who may be termed trainbearers to the law a sort of supernumeraries in the profession who are the hackneys of attorneys and will ride more miles for halfacrown than a postboy
during the time of dinner the somersetshire lawyer recollected the face of jones which he had seen at mr allworthy's for he had often visited in that gentleman's kitchen
he therefore took occasion to enquire after the good family there with that familiarity which would have become an intimate friend or acquaintance of mr allworthy and indeed he did all in his power to insinuate himself to be such though he had never had the honour of speaking to any person in that family higher than the butler
jones answered all his questions with much civility though he never remembered to have seen the pettyfogger before and though he concluded from the outward appearance and behaviour of the man that he usurped a freedom with his betters to which he was by no means intitled
as the conversation of fellows of this kind is of all others the most detestable to men of any sense the cloth was no sooner removed than mr jones withdrew and a little barbarously left poor mrs whitefield to do a penance which i have often heard mr timothy harris and other publicans of good taste lament as the severest lot annexed to their calling namely that of being obliged to keep company with their guests
jones had no sooner quitted the room than the pettyfogger in a whispering tone asked mrs whitefield if she knew who that fine spark was she answered she had never seen the gentleman beforethe gentleman indeed replied the pettyfogger a pretty gentleman truly
why he's the bastard of a fellow who was hanged for horsestealing
he was dropt at squire allworthy's door where one of the servants found him in a box so full of rainwater that he would certainly have been drowned had he not been reserved for another fateay ay you need not mention it i protest we understand what that fate is very well cries dowling with a most facetious grinwell continued the other the squire ordered him to be taken in for he is a timbersome man everybody knows and was afraid of drawing himself into a scrape and there the bastard was bred up and fed and cloathified all to the world like any gentleman and there he got one of the servantmaids with child and persuaded her to swear it to the squire himself and afterwards he broke the arm of one mr thwackum a clergyman only because he reprimanded him for following whores and afterwards he snapt a pistol at mr blifil behind his back and once when squire allworthy was sick he got a drum and beat it all over the house to prevent him from sleeping and twenty other pranks he hath played for all which about four or five days ago just before i left the country the squire stripped him stark naked and turned him out of doors  and very justly too i protest cries dowling i would turn my own son out of doors if he was guilty of half as much
and pray what is the name of this pretty gentleman  the name o' un answered pettyfogger why he is called thomas jones  jones answered dowling a little eagerly what mr jones that lived at mr allworthy's
was that the gentleman that dined with usthe very same said the other
i have heard of the gentleman cries dowling often but i never heard any ill character of himand i am sure says mrs whitefield if half what this gentleman hath said be true mr jones hath the most deceitful countenance i ever saw for sure his looks promise something very different and i must say for the little i have seen of him he is as civil a wellbred man as you would wish to converse with  pettyfogger calling to mind that he had not been sworn as he usually was before he gave his evidence now bound what he had declared with so many oaths and imprecations that the landlady's ears were shocked and she put a stop to his swearing by assuring him of her belief
upon which he said i hope madam you imagine i would scorn to tell such things of any man unless i knew them to be true
what interest have i in taking away the reputation of a man who never injured me
i promise you every syllable of what i have said is fact and the whole country knows it  as mrs whitefield had no reason to suspect that the pettyfogger had any motive or temptation to abuse jones the reader cannot blame her for believing what he so confidently affirmed with many oaths
she accordingly gave up her skill in physiognomy and henceforwards conceived so ill an opinion of her guest that she heartily wished him out of her house
this dislike was now farther increased by a report which mr whitefield made from the kitchen where partridge had informed the company that though he carried the knapsack and contented himself with staying among servants while tom jones as he called him was regaling in the parlour he was not his servant but only a friend and companion and as good a gentleman as mr jones himself  dowling sat all this while silent biting his fingers making faces grinning and looking wonderfully arch at last he opened his lips and protested that the gentleman looked like another sort of man
he then called for his bill with the utmost haste declared he must be at hereford that evening lamented his great hurry of business and wished he could divide himself into twenty pieces in order to be at once in twenty places
the pettyfogger now likewise departed and then jones desired the favour of mrs whitefield's company to drink tea with him but she refused and with a manner so different from that with which she had received him at dinner that it a little surprized him
and now he soon perceived her behaviour totally changed for instead of that natural affability which we have before celebrated she wore a constrained severity on her countenance which was so disagreeable to mr jones that he resolved however late to quit the house that evening
he did indeed account somewhat unfairly for this sudden change for besides some hard and unjust surmises concerning female fickleness and mutability he began to suspect that he owed this want of civility to his want of horses a sort of animals which as they dirty no sheets are thought in inns to pay better for their beds than their riders and are therefore considered as the more desirable company but mrs whitefield to do her justice had a much more liberal way of thinking
she was perfectly wellbred and could be very civil to a gentleman though he walked on foot
in reality she looked on our heroe as a sorry scoundrel and therefore treated him as such for which not even jones himself had he known as much as the reader could have blamed her nay on the contrary he must have approved her conduct and have esteemed her the more for the disrespect shown towards himself
this is indeed a most aggravating circumstance which attends depriving men unjustly of their reputation for a man who is conscious of having an ill character cannot justly be angry with those who neglect and slight him but ought rather to despise such as affect his conversation unless where a perfect intimacy must have convinced them that their friend's character hath been falsely and injuriously aspersed
this was not however the case of jones for as he was a perfect stranger to the truth so he was with good reason offended at the treatment he received
he therefore paid his reckoning and departed highly against the will of mr partridge who having remonstrated much against it to no purpose at last condescended to take up his knapsack and to attend his friend
chapter ix
containing several dialogues between jones and partridge concerning love cold hunger and other matters with the lucky and narrow escape of partridge as he was on the very brink of making a fatal discovery to his friend
the shadows began now to descend larger from the high mountains the feathered creation had betaken themselves to their rest
now the highest order of mortals were sitting down to their dinners and the lowest order to their suppers
in a word the clock struck five just as mr jones took his leave of gloucester an hour at which as it was now midwinter the dirty fingers of night would have drawn her sable curtain over the universe had not the moon forbid her who now with a face as broad and as red as those of some jolly mortals who like her turn night into day began to rise from her bed where she had slumbered away the day in order to sit up all night
jones had not travelled far before he paid his compliments to that beautiful planet and turning to his companion asked him if he had ever beheld so delicious an evening
partridge making no ready answer to his question he proceeded to comment on the beauty of the moon and repeated some passages from milton who hath certainly excelled all other poets in his description of the heavenly luminaries
he then told partridge the story from the spectator of two lovers who had agreed to entertain themselves when they were at a great distance from each other by repairing at a certain fixed hour to look at the moon thus pleasing themselves with the thought that they were both employed in contemplating the same object at the same time
those lovers added he must have had souls truly capable of feeling all the tenderness of the sublimest of all human passionsvery probably cries partridge but i envy them more if they had bodies incapable of feeling cold for i am almost frozen to death and am very much afraid i shall lose a piece of my nose before we get to another house of entertainment
nay truly we may well expect some judgment should happen to us for our folly in running away so by night from one of the most excellent inns i ever set my foot into
i am sure i never saw more good things in my life and the greatest lord in the land cannot live better in his own house than he may there
and to forsake such a house and go a rambling about the country the lord knows whither per devia rura viarum i say nothing for my part but some people might not have charity enough to conclude we were in our sober sensesfie upon it mr partridge says jones have a better heart consider you are going to face an enemy and are you afraid of facing a little cold
i wish indeed we had a guide to advise which of these roads we should takemay i be so bold says partridge to offer my advice
interdum stultus opportuna loquiturwhy which of them cries jones would you recommendtruly neither of them answered partridge
the only road we can be certain of finding is the road we came
a good hearty pace will bring us back to gloucester in an hour but if we go forward the lord harry knows when we shall arrive at any place for i see at least fifty miles before me and no house in all the wayyou see indeed a very fair prospect says jones which receives great additional beauty from the extreme lustre of the moon
however i will keep the lefthand track as that seems to lead directly to those hills which we were informed lie not far from worcester
and here if you are inclined to quit me you may and return back again but for my part i am resolved to go forward  it is unkind in you sir says partridge to suspect me of any such intention
what i have advised hath been as much on your account as on my own but since you are determined to go on i am as much determined to follow
i prae sequar te  they now travelled some miles without speaking to each other during which suspense of discourse jones often sighed and benjamin groaned as bitterly though from a very different reason
at length jones made a full stop and turning about cries who knows partridge but the loveliest creature in the universe may have her eyes now fixed on that very moon which i behold at this instant very likely sir  answered partridge and if my eyes were fixed on a good surloin of roast beef the devil might take the moon and her horns into the bargain did ever tramontane make such an answer cries jones
prithee partridge wast thou ever susceptible of love in thy life or hath time worn away all the traces of it from thy memory  alackaday cries partridge well would it have been for me if i had never known what love was
infandum regina jubes renovare dolorem
i am sure i have tasted all the tenderness and sublimities and bitternesses of the passion was your mistress unkind then  says jones
very unkind indeed sir answered partridge for she married me and made one of the most confounded wives in the world
however heaven be praised she's gone and if i believed she was in the moon according to a book i once read which teaches that to be the receptacle of departed spirits i would never look at it for fear of seeing her but i wish sir that the moon was a lookingglass for your sake and that miss sophia western was now placed before it my dear partridge cries jones what a thought was there
a thought which i am certain could never have entered into any mind but that of a lover
o partridge
could i hope once again to see that face but alas
all those golden dreams are vanished for ever and my only refuge from future misery is to forget the object of all my former happiness and do you really despair of ever seeing miss western again answered partridge if you will follow my advice i will engage you shall not only see her but have her in your arms ha
do not awaken a thought of that nature cries jones i have struggled sufficiently to conquer all such wishes already nay answered partridge if you do not wish to have your mistress in your arms you are a most extraordinary lover indeed well well says jones let us avoid this subject but pray what is your advice to give it you in the military phrase then says partridge as we are soldiers to the right about'
let us return the way we came we may yet reach gloucester tonight though late whereas if we proceed we are likely for aught i see to ramble about for ever without coming either to house or home i have already told you my resolution is to go on answered jones but i would have you go back
i am obliged to you for your company hither and i beg you to accept a guinea as a small instance of my gratitude
nay it would be cruel in me to suffer you to go any farther for to deal plainly with you my chief end and desire is a glorious death in the service of my king and country as for your money replied partridge i beg sir you will put it up i will receive none of you at this time for at present i am i believe the richer man of the two
and as your resolution is to go on so mine is to follow you if you do
nay now my presence appears absolutely necessary to take care of you since your intentions are so desperate for i promise you my views are much more prudent as you are resolved to fall in battle if you can so i am resolved as firmly to come to no hurt if i can help it
and indeed i have the comfort to think there will be but little danger for a popish priest told me the other day the business would soon be over and he believed without a battle a popish priest cries jones i have heard is not always to be believed when he speaks in behalf of his religion yes but so far  answered the other from speaking in behalf of his religion he assured me the catholicks did not expect to be any gainers by the change for that prince charles was as good a protestant as any in england and that nothing but regard to right made him and the rest of the popish party to be jacobitesi believe him to be as much a protestant as i believe he hath any right says jones and i make no doubt of our success but not without a battle
so that i am not so sanguine as your friend the popish priest nay to be sure sir  answered partridge all the prophecies i have ever read speak of a great deal of blood to be spilt in the quarrel and the miller with three thumbs who is now alive is to hold the horses of three kings up to his knees in blood
lord have mercy upon us all and send better times with what stuff and nonsense hast thou filled thy head answered jones this too i suppose comes from the popish priest
monsters and prodigies are the proper arguments to support monstrous and absurd doctrines
the cause of king george is the cause of liberty and true religion
in other words it is the cause of common sense my boy and i warrant you will succeed though briarius himself was to rise again with his hundred thumbs and to turn miller partridge made no reply to this
he was indeed cast into the utmost confusion by this declaration of jones
for to inform the reader of a secret which he had no proper opportunity of revealing before partridge was in truth a jacobite and had concluded that jones was of the same party and was now proceeding to join the rebels
an opinion which was not without foundation
for the tall longsided dame mentioned by hudibrasthat manyeyed manytongued manymouthed manyeared monster of virgil had related the story of the quarrel between jones and the officer with the usual regard to truth
she had indeed changed the name of sophia into that of the pretender and had reported that drinking his health was the cause for which jones was knocked down
this partridge had heard and most firmly believed
'tis no wonder therefore that he had thence entertained the abovementioned opinion of jones and which he had almost discovered to him before he found out his own mistake
and at this the reader will be the less inclined to wonder if he pleases to recollect the doubtful phrase in which jones first communicated his resolution to mr partridge and indeed had the words been less ambiguous partridge might very well have construed them as he did being persuaded as he was that the whole nation were of the same inclination in their hearts nor did it stagger him that jones had travelled in the company of soldiers for he had the same opinion of the army which he had of the rest of the people
but however well affected he might be to james or charles he was still much more attached to little benjamin than to either for which reason he no sooner discovered the principles of his fellowtraveller than he thought proper to conceal and outwardly give up his own to the man on whom he depended for the making his fortune since he by no means believed the affairs of jones to be so desperate as they really were with mr allworthy for as he had kept a constant correspondence with some of his neighbours since he left that country he had heard much indeed more than was true of the great affection mr allworthy bore this young man who as partridge had been instructed was to be that gentleman's heir and whom as we have said he did not in the least doubt to be his son
he imagined therefore that whatever quarrel was between them it would be certainly made up at the return of mr jones an event from which he promised great advantages if he could take this opportunity of ingratiating himself with that young gentleman and if he could by any means be instrumental in procuring his return he doubted not as we have before said but it would as highly advance him in the favour of mr allworthy
we have already observed that he was a very goodnatured fellow and he hath himself declared the violent attachment he had to the person and character of jones but possibly the views which i have just before mentioned might likewise have some little share in prompting him to undertake this expedition at least in urging him to continue it after he had discovered that his master and himself like some prudent fathers and sons though they travelled together in great friendship had embraced opposite parties
i am led into this conjecture by having remarked that though love friendship esteem and such like have very powerful operations in the human mind interest however is an ingredient seldom omitted by wise men when they would work others to their own purposes
this is indeed a most excellent medicine and like ward's pill flies at once to the particular part of the body on which you desire to operate whether it be the tongue the hand or any other member where it scarce ever fails of immediately producing the desired effect
chapter x
in which our travellers meet with a very extraordinary adventure
just as jones and his friend came to the end of their dialogue in the preceding chapter they arrived at the bottom of a very steep hill
here jones stopt short and directing his eyes upwards stood for a while silent
at length he called to his companion and said partridge i wish i was at the top of this hill it must certainly afford a most charming prospect especially by this light for the solemn gloom which the moon casts on all objects is beyond expression beautiful especially to an imagination which is desirous of cultivating melancholy ideasvery probably answered partridge but if the top of the hill be properest to produce melancholy thoughts i suppose the bottom is the likeliest to produce merry ones and these i take to be much the better of the two
i protest you have made my blood run cold with the very mentioning the top of that mountain which seems to me to be one of the highest in the world
no no if we look for anything let it be for a place under ground to screen ourselves from the frostdo so said jones let it be but within hearing of this place and i will hallow to you at my return backsurely sir you are not mad said partridgeindeed i am answered jones if ascending this hill be madness but as you complain so much of the cold already i would have you stay below
i will certainly return to you within an hourpardon me sir cries partridge i have determined to follow you wherever you go indeed he was now afraid to stay behind for though he was coward enough in all respects yet his chief fear was that of ghosts with which the present time of night and the wildness of the place extremely well suited
at this instant partridge espied a glimmering light through some trees which seemed very near to them
he immediately cried out in a rapture oh sir
heaven hath at last heard my prayers and hath brought us to a house perhaps it may be an inn
let me beseech you sir if you have any compassion either for me or yourself do not despise the goodness of providence but let us go directly to yon light
whether it be a publichouse or no i am sure if they be christians that dwell there they will not refuse a little houseroom to persons in our miserable condition jones at length yielded to the earnest supplications of partridge and both together made directly towards the place whence the light issued
they soon arrived at the door of this house or cottage for it might be called either without much impropriety
here jones knocked several times without receiving any answer from within at which partridge whose head was full of nothing but of ghosts devils witches and such like began to tremble crying lord have mercy upon us
surely the people must be all dead
i can see no light neither now and yet i am certain i saw a candle burning but a moment beforewell
i have heard of such thingswhat hast thou heard of said jones
the people are either fast asleep or probably as this is a lonely place are afraid to open their door he then began to vociferate pretty loudly and at last an old woman opening an upper casement asked who they were and what they wanted
jones answered they were travellers who had lost their way and having seen a light in the window had been led thither in hopes of finding some fire to warm themselves
whoever you are cries the woman you have no business here nor shall i open the door to any one at this time of night  partridge whom the sound of a human voice had recovered from his fright fell to the most earnest supplications to be admitted for a few minutes to the fire saying he was almost dead with the cold to which fear had indeed contributed equally with the frost
he assured her that the gentleman who spoke to her was one of the greatest squires in the country and made use of every argument save one which jones afterwards effectually added and this was the promise of halfacrowna bribe too great to be resisted by such a person especially as the genteel appearance of jones which the light of the moon plainly discovered to her together with his affable behaviour had entirely subdued those apprehensions of thieves which she had at first conceived
she agreed therefore at last to let them in where partridge to his infinite joy found a good fire ready for his reception
the poor fellow however had no sooner warmed himself than those thoughts which were always uppermost in his mind began a little to disturb his brain
there was no article of his creed in which he had a stronger faith than he had in witchcraft nor can the reader conceive a figure more adapted to inspire this idea than the old woman who now stood before him
she answered exactly to that picture drawn by otway in his orphan
indeed if this woman had lived in the reign of james the first her appearance alone would have hanged her almost without any evidence
many circumstances likewise conspired to confirm partridge in his opinion
her living as he then imagined by herself in so lonely a place and in a house the outside of which seemed much too good for her but its inside was furnished in the most neat and elegant manner
to say the truth jones himself was not a little surprized at what he saw for besides the extraordinary neatness of the room it was adorned with a great number of nicknacks and curiosities which might have engaged the attention of a virtuoso
while jones was admiring these things and partridge sat trembling with the firm belief that he was in the house of a witch the old woman said i hope gentlemen you will make what haste you can for i expect my master presently and i would not for double the money he should find you herethen you have a master cried jones
indeed you will excuse me good woman but i was surprized to see all those fine things in your houseah sir said she if the twentieth part of these things were mine i should think myself a rich woman
but pray sir do not stay much longer for i look for him in every minutewhy sure he would not be angry with you said jones for doing a common act of charityalackaday sir said she he is a strange man not at all like other people
he keeps no company with anybody and seldom walks out but by night for he doth not care to be seen and all the country people are as much afraid of meeting him for his dress is enough to frighten those who are not used to it
they call him the man of the hill for there he walks by night and the country people are not i believe more afraid of the devil himself
he would be terribly angry if he found you herepray sir says partridge don't let us offend the gentleman i am ready to walk and was never warmer in my life
do pray sir let us go
here are pistols over the chimney who knows whether they be charged or no or what he may do with themfear nothing partridge cries jones i will secure thee from dangernay for matter o' that he never doth any mischief said the woman but to be sure it is necessary he should keep some arms for his own safety for his house hath been beset more than once and it is not many nights ago that we thought we heard thieves about it for my own part i have often wondered that he is not murdered by some villain or other as he walks out by himself at such hours but then as i said the people are afraid of him and besides they think i suppose he hath nothing about him worth takingi should imagine by this collection of rarities cries jones that your master had been a travelleryes sir answered she he hath been a very great one there be few gentlemen that know more of all matters than he
i fancy he hath been crost in love or whatever it is i know not but i have lived with him above these thirty years and in all that time he hath hardly spoke to six living people she then again solicited their departure in which she was backed by partridge but jones purposely protracted the time for his curiosity was greatly raised to see this extraordinary person
though the old woman therefore concluded every one of her answers with desiring him to be gone and partridge proceeded so far as to pull him by the sleeve he still continued to invent new questions till the old woman with an affrighted countenance declared she heard her master's signal and at the same instant more than one voice was heard without the door crying dn your blood show us your money this instant
your money you villain or we will blow your brains about your ears  o good heaven cries the old woman some villains to be sure have attacked my master
o la
what shall i do
what shall i dohow cries jones howare these pistols loadedo good sir there is nothing in them indeed
o pray don't murder us gentlemen for in reality she now had the same opinion of those within as she had of those without
jones made her no answer but snatching an old broad sword which hung in the room he instantly sallied out where he found the old gentleman struggling with two ruffians and begging for mercy
jones asked no questions but fell so briskly to work with his broad sword that the fellows immediately quitted their hold and without offering to attack our heroe betook themselves to their heels and made their escape for he did not attempt to pursue them being contented with having delivered the old gentleman and indeed he concluded he had pretty well done their business for both of them as they ran off cried out with bitter oaths that they were dead men
jones presently ran to lift up the old gentleman who had been thrown down in the scuffle expressing at the same time great concern lest he should have received any harm from the villains
the old man stared a moment at jones and then cried no sir no i have very little harm i thank you
lord have mercy upon mei see sir said jones you are not free from apprehensions even of those who have had the happiness to be your deliverers nor can i blame any suspicions which you may have but indeed you have no real occasion for any here are none but your friends present
having mist our way this cold night we took the liberty of warming ourselves at your fire whence we were just departing when we heard you call for assistance which i must say providence alone seems to have sent youprovidence indeed cries the old gentleman if it be soso it is i assure you cries jones
here is your own sword sir i have used it in your defence and i now return it into your hand the old man having received the sword which was stained with the blood of his enemies looked stedfastly at jones during some moments and then with a sigh cried out you will pardon me young gentleman i was not always of a suspicious temper nor am i a friend to ingratitude  be thankful then cries jones to that providence to which you owe your deliverance as to my part i have only discharged the common duties of humanity and what i would have done for any fellowcreature in your situationlet me look at you a little longer cries the old gentleman
you are a human creature then
well perhaps you are
come pray walk into my little hutt
you have been my deliverer indeed  the old woman was distracted between the fears which she had of her master and for him and partridge was if possible in a greater fright
the former of these however when she heard her master speak kindly to jones and perceived what had happened came again to herself but partridge no sooner saw the gentleman than the strangeness of his dress infused greater terrors into that poor fellow than he had before felt either from the strange description which he had heard or from the uproar which had happened at the door
to say the truth it was an appearance which might have affected a more constant mind than that of mr partridge
this person was of the tallest size with a long beard as white as snow
his body was cloathed with the skin of an ass made something into the form of a coat
he wore likewise boots on his legs and a cap on his head both composed of the skin of some other animals
as soon as the old gentleman came into his house the old woman began her congratulations on his happy escape from the ruffians
yes  cried he i have escaped indeed thanks to my preservero the blessing on him answered she he is a good gentleman i warrant him
i was afraid your worship would have been angry with me for letting him in and to be certain i should not have done it had not i seen by the moonlight that he was a gentleman and almost frozen to death
and to be certain it must have been some good angel that sent him hither and tempted me to do it  i am afraid sir said the old gentleman to jones that i have nothing in this house which you can either eat or drink unless you will accept a dram of brandy of which i can give you some most excellent and which i have had by me these thirty years jones declined this offer in a very civil and proper speech and then the other asked him whither he was travelling when he mist his way  saying i must own myself surprized to see such a person as you appear to be journeying on foot at this time of night
i suppose sir you are a gentleman of these parts for you do not look like one who is used to travel far without horses  appearances cried jones are often deceitful men sometimes look what they are not
i assure you i am not of this country and whither i am travelling in reality i scarce know myself  whoever you are or whithersoever you are going answered the old man i have obligations to you which i can never return  i once more replied jones affirm that you have none for there can be no merit in having hazarded that in your service on which i set no value and nothing is so contemptible in my eyes as life  i am sorry young gentleman answered the stranger that you have any reason to be so unhappy at your years  indeed i am sir answered jones the most unhappy of mankindperhaps you have had a friend or a mistress replied the other
how could you cries jones mention two words sufficient to drive me to distractioneither of them are enough to drive any man to distraction answered the old man
i enquire no farther sir perhaps my curiosity hath led me too far already  indeed sir cries jones i cannot censure a passion which i feel at this instant in the highest degree
you will pardon me when i assure you that everything which i have seen or heard since i first entered this house hath conspired to raise the greatest curiosity in me
something very extraordinary must have determined you to this course of life and i have reason to fear your own history is not without misfortunes  here the old gentleman again sighed and remained silent for some minutes at last looking earnestly on jones he said i have read that a good countenance is a letter of recommendation if so none ever can be more strongly recommended than yourself
if i did not feel some yearnings towards you from another consideration i must be the most ungrateful monster upon earth and i am really concerned it is no otherwise in my power than by words to convince you of my gratitude  jones after a moment's hesitation answered that it was in his power by words to gratify him extremely
i have confest a curiosity  said he sir need i say how much obliged i should be to you if you would condescend to gratify it
will you suffer me therefore to beg unless any consideration restrains you that you would be pleased to acquaint me what motives have induced you thus to withdraw from the society of mankind and to betake yourself to a course of life to which it sufficiently appears you were not born  i scarce think myself at liberty to refuse you anything after what hath happened replied the old man
if you desire therefore to hear the story of an unhappy man i will relate it to you
indeed you judge rightly in thinking there is commonly something extraordinary in the fortunes of those who fly from society for however it may seem a paradox or even a contradiction certain it is that great philanthropy chiefly inclines us to avoid and detest mankind not on account so much of their private and selfish vices but for those of a relative kind such as envy malice treachery cruelty with every other species of malevolence
these are the vices which true philanthropy abhors and which rather than see and converse with she avoids society itself
however without a compliment to you you do not appear to me one of those whom i should shun or detest nay i must say in what little hath dropt from you there appears some parity in our fortunes i hope however yours will conclude more successfully  here some compliments passed between our heroe and his host and then the latter was going to begin his history when partridge interrupted him
his apprehensions had now pretty well left him but some effects of his terrors remained he therefore reminded the gentleman of that excellent brandy which he had mentioned
this was presently brought and partridge swallowed a large bumper
the gentleman then without any farther preface began as you may read in the next chapter
chapter xi
in which the man of the hill begins to relate his history
i was born in a village of somersetshire called mark in the year 
my father was one of those whom they call gentlemen farmers
he had a little estate of about  a year of his own and rented another estate of near the same value
he was prudent and industrious and so good a husbandman that he might have led a very easy and comfortable life had not an arrant vixen of a wife soured his domestic quiet
but though this circumstance perhaps made him miserable it did not make him poor for he confined her almost entirely at home and rather chose to bear eternal upbraidings in his own house than to injure his fortune by indulging her in the extravagancies she desired abroad
by this xanthippe so was the wife of socrates called said partridgeby this xanthippe he had two sons of which i was the younger
he designed to give us both good education but my elder brother who unhappily for him was the favourite of my mother utterly neglected his learning insomuch that after having been five or six years at school with little or no improvement my father being told by his master that it would be to no purpose to keep him longer there at last complied with my mother in taking him home from the hands of that tyrant as she called his master though indeed he gave the lad much less correction than his idleness deserved but much more it seems than the young gentleman liked who constantly complained to his mother of his severe treatment and she as constantly gave him a hearing  yes yes cries partridge i have seen such mothers i have been abused myself by them and very unjustly such parents deserve correction as much as their children  jones chid the pedagogue for his interruption and then the stranger proceeded
my brother now at the age of fifteen bade adieu to all learning and to everything else but to his dog and gun with which latter he became so expert that though perhaps you may think it incredible he could not only hit a standing mark with great certainty but hath actually shot a crow as it was flying in the air
he was likewise excellent at finding a hare sitting and was soon reputed one of the best sportsmen in the country a reputation which both he and his mother enjoyed as much as if he had been thought the finest scholar
the situation of my brother made me at first think my lot the harder in being continued at school but i soon changed my opinion for as i advanced pretty fast in learning my labours became easy and my exercise so delightful that holidays were my most unpleasant time for my mother who never loved me now apprehending that i had the greater share of my father's affection and finding or at least thinking that i was more taken notice of by some gentlemen of learning and particularly by the parson of the parish than my brother she now hated my sight and made home so disagreeable to me that what is called by schoolboys black monday was to me the whitest in the whole year
having at length gone through the school at taunton i was thence removed to exeter college in oxford where i remained four years at the end of which an accident took me off entirely from my studies and hence i may truly date the rise of all which happened to me afterwards in life
there was at the same college with myself one sir george gresham a young fellow who was intitled to a very considerable fortune which he was not by the will of his father to come into full possession of till he arrived at the age of twentyfive
however the liberality of his guardians gave him little cause to regret the abundant caution of his father for they allowed him five hundred pounds a year while he remained at the university where he kept his horses and his whore and lived as wicked and as profligate a life as he could have done had he been never so entirely master of his fortune for besides the five hundred a year which he received from his guardians he found means to spend a thousand more
he was above the age of twentyone and had no difficulty in gaining what credit he pleased
this young fellow among many other tolerable bad qualities had one very diabolical
he had a great delight in destroying and ruining the youth of inferior fortune by drawing them into expenses which they could not afford so well as himself and the better and worthier and soberer any young man was the greater pleasure and triumph had he in his destruction
thus acting the character which is recorded of the devil and going about seeking whom he might devour
it was my misfortune to fall into an acquaintance and intimacy with this gentleman
my reputation of diligence in my studies made me a desirable object of his mischievous intention and my own inclination made it sufficiently easy for him to effect his purpose for though i had applied myself with much industry to books in which i took great delight there were other pleasures in which i was capable of taking much greater for i was highmettled had a violent flow of animal spirits was a little ambitious and extremely amorous
i had not long contracted an intimacy with sir george before i became a partaker of all his pleasures and when i was once entered on that scene neither my inclination nor my spirit would suffer me to play an under part
i was second to none of the company in any acts of debauchery nay i soon distinguished myself so notably in all riots and disorders that my name generally stood first in the roll of delinquents and instead of being lamented as the unfortunate pupil of sir george i was now accused as the person who had misled and debauched that hopeful young gentleman for though he was the ringleader and promoter of all the mischief he was never so considered
i fell at last under the censure of the vicechancellor and very narrowly escaped expulsion
you will easily believe sir that such a life as i am now describing must be incompatible with my further progress in learning and that in proportion as i addicted myself more and more to loose pleasure i must grow more and more remiss in application to my studies
this was truly the consequence but this was not all
my expenses now greatly exceeded not only my former income but those additions which i extorted from my poor generous father on pretences of sums being necessary for preparing for my approaching degree of batchelor of arts
these demands however grew at last so frequent and exorbitant that my father by slow degrees opened his ears to the accounts which he received from many quarters of my present behaviour and which my mother failed not to echo very faithfully and loudly adding ay this is the fine gentleman the scholar who doth so much honour to his family and is to be the making of it
i thought what all this learning would come to
he is to be the ruin of us all i find after his elder brother hath been denied necessaries for his sake to perfect his education forsooth for which he was to pay us such interest i thought what the interest would come to' with much more of the same kind but i have i believe satisfied you with this taste
my father therefore began now to return remonstrances instead of money to my demands which brought my affairs perhaps a little sooner to a crisis but had he remitted me his whole income you will imagine it could have sufficed a very short time to support one who kept pace with the expenses of sir george gresham
it is more than possible that the distress i was now in for money and the impracticability of going on in this manner might have restored me at once to my senses and to my studies had i opened my eyes before i became involved in debts from which i saw no hopes of ever extricating myself
this was indeed the great art of sir george and by which he accomplished the ruin of many whom he afterwards laughed at as fools and coxcombs for vying as he called it with a man of his fortune
to bring this about he would now and then advance a little money himself in order to support the credit of the unfortunate youth with other people till by means of that very credit he was irretrievably undone
my mind being by these means grown as desperate as my fortune there was scarce a wickedness which i did not meditate in order for my relief
selfmurder itself became the subject of my serious deliberation and i had certainly resolved on it had not a more shameful though perhaps less sinful thought expelled it from my headhere he hesitated a moment and then cried out i protest so many years have not washed away the shame of this act and i shall blush while i relate it jones desired him to pass over anything that might give him pain in the relation but partridge eagerly cried out oh pray sir let us hear this i had rather hear this than all the rest as i hope to be saved i will never mention a word of it jones was going to rebuke him but the stranger prevented it by proceeding thus i had a chum a very prudent frugal young lad who though he had no very large allowance had by his parsimony heaped up upwards of forty guineas which i knew he kept in his escritore
i took therefore an opportunity of purloining his key from his breechespocket while he was asleep and thus made myself master of all his riches after which i again conveyed his key into his pocket and counterfeiting sleepthough i never once closed my eyes lay in bed till after he arose and went to prayersan exercise to which i had long been unaccustomed
timorous thieves by extreme caution often subject themselves to discoveries which those of a bolder kind escape
thus it happened to me for had i boldly broke open his escritore i had perhaps escaped even his suspicion but as it was plain that the person who robbed him had possessed himself of his key he had no doubt when he first missed his money but that his chum was certainly the thief
now as he was of a fearful disposition and much my inferior in strength and i believe in courage he did not dare to confront me with my guilt for fear of worse bodily consequences which might happen to him
he repaired therefore immediately to the vicechancellor and upon swearing to the robbery and to the circumstances of it very easily obtained a warrant against one who had now so bad a character through the whole university
luckily for me i lay out of the college the next evening for that day i attended a young lady in a chaise to witney where we staid all night and in our return the next morning to oxford i met one of my cronies who acquainted me with sufficient news concerning myself to make me turn my horse another way  pray sir did he mention anything of the warrant said partridge
but jones begged the gentleman to proceed without regarding any impertinent questions which he did as follows  having now abandoned all thoughts of returning to oxford the next thing which offered itself was a journey to london
i imparted this intention to my female companion who at first remonstrated against it but upon producing my wealth she immediately consented
we then struck across the country into the great cirencester road and made such haste that we spent the next evening save one in london
when you consider the place where i now was and the company with whom i was you will i fancy conceive that a very short time brought me to an end of that sum of which i had so iniquitously possessed myself
i was now reduced to a much higher degree of distress than before the necessaries of life began to be numbered among my wants and what made my case still the more grievous was that my paramour of whom i was now grown immoderately fond shared the same distresses with myself
to see a woman you love in distress to be unable to relieve her and at the same time to reflect that you have brought her into this situation is perhaps a curse of which no imagination can represent the horrors to those who have not felt iti believe it from my soul cries jones and i pity you from the bottom of my heart he then took two or three disorderly turns about the room and at last begged pardon and flung himself into his chair crying i thank heaven i have escaped that  this circumstance continued the gentleman so severely aggravated the horrors of my present situation that they became absolutely intolerable
i could with less pain endure the raging in my own natural unsatisfied appetites even hunger or thirst than i could submit to leave ungratified the most whimsical desires of a woman on whom i so extravagantly doated that though i knew she had been the mistress of half my acquaintance i firmly intended to marry her
but the good creature was unwilling to consent to an action which the world might think so much to my disadvantage
and as possibly she compassionated the daily anxieties which she must have perceived me suffer on her account she resolved to put an end to my distress
she soon indeed found means to relieve me from my troublesome and perplexed situation for while i was distracted with various inventions to supply her with pleasures she very kindlybetrayed me to one of her former lovers at oxford by whose care and diligence i was immediately apprehended and committed to gaol
here i first began seriously to reflect on the miscarriages of my former life on the errors i had been guilty of on the misfortunes which i had brought on myself and on the grief which i must have occasioned to one of the best of fathers
when i added to all these the perfidy of my mistress such was the horror of my mind that life instead of being longer desirable grew the object of my abhorrence and i could have gladly embraced death as my dearest friend if it had offered itself to my choice unattended by shame
the time of the assizes soon came and i was removed by habeas corpus to oxford where i expected certain conviction and condemnation but to my great surprize none appeared against me and i was at the end of the sessions discharged for want of prosecution
in short my chum had left oxford and whether from indolence or from what other motive i am ignorant had declined concerning himself any farther in the affair  perhaps cries partridge he did not care to have your blood upon his hands and he was in the right on't
if any person was to be hanged upon my evidence i should never be able to lie alone afterwards for fear of seeing his ghost  i shall shortly doubt partridge says jones whether thou art more brave or wiseyou may laugh at me sir if you please answered partridge but if you will hear a very short story which i can tell and which is most certainly true perhaps you may change your opinion
in the parish where i was born here jones would have silenced him but the stranger interceded that he might be permitted to tell his story and in the meantime promised to recollect the remainder of his own
partridge then proceeded thus in the parish where i was born there lived a farmer whose name was bridle and he had a son named francis a good hopeful young fellow i was at the grammarschool with him where i remember he was got into ovid's epistles and he could construe you three lines together sometimes without looking into a dictionary
besides all this he was a very good lad never missed church o' sundays and was reckoned one of the best psalmsingers in the whole parish
he would indeed now and then take a cup too much and that was the only fault he hadwell but come to the ghost  cries jones
never fear sir i shall come to him soon enough  answered partridge
you must know then that farmer bridle lost a mare a sorrel one to the best of my remembrance and so it fell out that this young francis shortly afterward being at a fair at hindon and as i think it was on i can't remember the day and being as he was what should he happen to meet but a man upon his father's mare
frank called out presently stop thief and it being in the middle of the fair it was impossible you know for the man to make his escape
so they apprehended him and carried him before the justice i remember it was justice willoughby of noyle a very worthy good gentleman and he committed him to prison and bound frank in a recognisance i think they call ita hard word compounded of re and cognosco but it differs in its meaning from the use of the simple as many other compounds do
well at last down came my lord justice page to hold the assizes and so the fellow was had up and frank was had up for a witness
to be sure i shall never forget the face of the judge when he began to ask him what he had to say against the prisoner
he made poor frank tremble and shake in his shoes
well you fellow' says my lord what have you to say
don't stand humming and hawing but speak out'
but however he soon turned altogether as civil to frank and began to thunder at the fellow and when he asked him if he had anything to say for himself the fellow said he had found the horse
ay'
answered the judge thou art a lucky fellow i have travelled the circuit these forty years and never found a horse in my life but i'll tell thee what friend thou wast more lucky than thou didst know of for thou didst not only find a horse but a halter too i promise thee'
to be sure i shall never forget the word
upon which everybody fell a laughing as how could they help it
nay and twenty other jests he made which i can't remember now
there was something about his skill in horseflesh which made all the folks laugh
to be certain the judge must have been a very brave man as well as a man of much learning
it is indeed charming sport to hear trials upon life and death
one thing i own i thought a little hard that the prisoner's counsel was not suffered to speak for him though he desired only to be heard one very short word but my lord would not hearken to him though he suffered a counsellor to talk against him for above halfanhour
i thought it hard i own that there should be so many of them my lord and the court and the jury and the counsellors and the witnesses all upon one poor man and he too in chains
well the fellow was hanged as to be sure it could be no otherwise and poor frank could never be easy about it
he never was in the dark alone but he fancied he saw the fellow's spiritwell and is this thy story cries jones
no no answered partridge
o lord have mercy upon me
i am just now coming to the matter for one night coming from the alehouse in a long narrow dark lane there he ran directly up against him and the spirit was all in white and fell upon frank and frank who was a sturdy lad fell upon the spirit again and there they had a tussel together and poor frank was dreadfully beat indeed he made a shift at last to crawl home but what with the beating and what with the fright he lay ill above a fortnight and all this is most certainly true and the whole parish will bear witness to it  the stranger smiled at this story and jones burst into a loud fit of laughter upon which partridge cried ay you may laugh sir and so did some others particularly a squire who is thought to be no better than an atheist who forsooth because there was a calf with a white face found dead in the same lane the next morning would fain have it that the battle was between frank and that as if a calf would set upon a man
besides frank told me he knew it to be a spirit and could swear to him in any court in christendom and he had not drank above a quart or two or such a matter of liquor at the time
lud have mercy upon us and keep us all from dipping our hands in blood i say  well sir said jones to the stranger mr partridge hath finished his story and i hope will give you no future interruption if you will be so kind to proceed he then resumed his narration but as he hath taken breath for a while we think proper to give it to our reader and shall therefore put an end to this chapter
chapter xii
in which the man of the hill continues his history
i had now regained my liberty said the stranger but i had lost my reputation for there is a wide difference between the case of a man who is barely acquitted of a crime in a court of justice and of him who is acquitted in his own heart and in the opinion of the people
i was conscious of my guilt and ashamed to look any one in the face so resolved to leave oxford the next morning before the daylight discovered me to the eyes of any beholders
when i had got clear of the city it first entered into my head to return home to my father and endeavour to obtain his forgiveness but as i had no reason to doubt his knowledge of all which had past and as i was well assured of his great aversion to all acts of dishonesty i could entertain no hopes of being received by him especially since i was too certain of all the good offices in the power of my mother nay had my father's pardon been as sure as i conceived his resentment to be i yet question whether i could have had the assurance to behold him or whether i could upon any terms have submitted to live and converse with those who i was convinced knew me to have been guilty of so base an action
i hastened therefore back to london the best retirement of either grief or shame unless for persons of a very public character for here you have the advantage of solitude without its disadvantage since you may be alone and in company at the same time and while you walk or sit unobserved noise hurry and a constant succession of objects entertain the mind and prevent the spirits from preying on themselves or rather on grief or shame which are the most unwholesome diet in the world and on which though there are many who never taste either but in public there are some who can feed very plentifully and very fatally when alone
but as there is scarce any human good without its concomitant evil so there are people who find an inconvenience in this unobserving temper of mankind i mean persons who have no money for as you are not put out of countenance so neither are you cloathed or fed by those who do not know you
and a man may be as easily starved in leadenhallmarket as in the deserts of arabia
it was at present my fortune to be destitute of that great evil as it is apprehended to be by several writers who i suppose were overburthened with it namely moneywith submission sir said partridge i do not remember any writers who have called it malorum but irritamenta malorum
effodiuntur opes irritamenta malorumwell sir continued the stranger whether it be an evil or only the cause of evil i was entirely void of it and at the same time of friends and as i thought of acquaintance when one evening as i was passing through the inner temple very hungry and very miserable i heard a voice on a sudden hailing me with great familiarity by my christian name and upon turning about i presently recollected the person who so saluted me to have been my fellowcollegiate one who had left the university above a year and long before any of my misfortunes had befallen me
this gentleman whose name was watson shook me heartily by the hand and expressing great joy at meeting me proposed our immediately drinking a bottle together
i first declined the proposal and pretended business but as he was very earnest and pressing hunger at last overcame my pride and i fairly confessed to him i had no money in my pocket yet not without framing a lie for an excuse and imputing it to my having changed my breeches that morning
mr watson answered i thought jack you and i had been too old acquaintance for you to mention such a matter'
he then took me by the arm and was pulling me along but i gave him very little trouble for my own inclinations pulled me much stronger than he could do
we then went into the friars which you know is the scene of all mirth and jollity
here when we arrived at the tavern mr watson applied himself to the drawer only without taking the least notice of the cook for he had no suspicion but that i had dined long since
however as the case was really otherwise i forged another falsehood and told my companion i had been at the further end of the city on business of consequence and had snapt up a muttonchop in haste so that i was again hungry and wished he would add a beefsteak to his bottlesome people cries partridge ought to have good memories or did you find just money enough in your breeches to pay for the muttonchopyour observation is right answered the stranger and i believe such blunders are inseparable from all dealing in untruthbut to proceedi began now to feel myself extremely happy
the meat and wine soon revived my spirits to a high pitch and i enjoyed much pleasure in the conversation of my old acquaintance the rather as i thought him entirely ignorant of what had happened at the university since his leaving it
but he did not suffer me to remain long in this agreeable delusion for taking a bumper in one hand and holding me by the other here my boy' cries he here's wishing you joy of your being so honourably acquitted of that affair laid to your charge'
i was thunderstruck with confusion at those words which watson observing proceeded thus nay never be ashamed man thou hast been acquitted and no one now dares call thee guilty but prithee do tell me who am thy friendi hope thou didst really rob him
for rat me if it was not a meritorious action to strip such a sneaking pitiful rascal and instead of the two hundred guineas i wish you had taken as many thousand
come come my boy don't be shy of confessing to me you are not now brought before one of the pimps
dn me if i don't honour you for it for as i hope for salvation i would have made no manner of scruple of doing the same thing'
this declaration a little relieved my abashment and as wine had now somewhat opened my heart i very freely acknowledged the robbery but acquainted him that he had been misinformed as to the sum taken which was little more than a fifth part of what he had mentioned
i am sorry for it with all my heart' quoth he and i wish thee better success another time
though if you will take my advice you shall have no occasion to run any such risque
here' said he taking some dice out of his pocket here's the stuff
here are the implements here are the little doctors which cure the distempers of the purse
follow but my counsel and i will show you a way to empty the pocket of a queer cull without any danger of the nubbing cheat
'  nubbing cheat cries partridge pray sir what is that  why that sir says the stranger is a cant phrase for the gallows for as gamesters differ little from highwaymen in their morals so do they very much resemble them in their language
we had now each drank our bottle when mr watson said the board was sitting and that he must attend earnestly pressing me at the same time to go with him and try my fortune
i answered he knew that was at present out of my power as i had informed him of the emptiness of my pocket
to say the truth i doubted not from his many strong expressions of friendship but that he would offer to lend me a small sum for that purpose but he answered never mind that man e'en boldly run a levant' partridge was going to inquire the meaning of that word but jones stopped his mouth but be circumspect as to the man
i will tip you the proper person which may be necessary as you do not know the town nor can distinguish a rum cull from a queer one  the bill was now brought when watson paid his share and was departing
i reminded him not without blushing of my having no money
he answered that signifies nothing score it behind the door or make a bold brush and take no noticeorstay' says he i will go downstairs first and then do you take up my money and score the whole reckoning at the bar and i will wait for you at the corner'
i expressed some dislike at this and hinted my expectations that he would have deposited the whole but he swore he had not another sixpence in his pocket
he then went down and i was prevailed on to take up the money and follow him which i did close enough to hear him tell the drawer the reckoning was upon the table
the drawer past by me upstairs but i made such haste into the street that i heard nothing of his disappointment nor did i mention a syllable at the bar according to my instructions
we now went directly to the gamingtable where mr watson to my surprize pulled out a large sum of money and placed it before him as did many others all of them no doubt considering their own heaps as so many decoy birds which were to intice and draw over the heaps of their neighbours
here it would be tedious to relate all the freaks which fortune or rather the dice played in this her temple
mountains of gold were in a few moments reduced to nothing at one part of the table and rose as suddenly in another
the rich grew in a moment poor and the poor as suddenly became rich so that it seemed a philosopher could nowhere have so well instructed his pupils in the contempt of riches at least he could nowhere have better inculcated the incertainty of their duration
for my own part after having considerably improved my small estate i at last entirely demolished it
mr watson too after much variety of luck rose from the table in some heat and declared he had lost a cool hundred and would play no longer
then coming up to me he asked me to return with him to the tavern but i positively refused saying i would not bring myself a second time into such a dilemma and especially as he had lost all his money and was now in my own condition
pooh'
says he i have just borrowed a couple of guineas of a friend and one of them is at your service'
he immediately put one of them into my hand and i no longer resisted his inclination
i was at first a little shocked at returning to the same house whence we had departed in so unhandsome a manner but when the drawer with very civil address told us he believed we had forgot to pay our reckoning' i became perfectly easy and very readily gave him a guinea bid him pay himself and acquiesced in the unjust charge which had been laid on my memory
mr watson now bespoke the most extravagant supper he could well think of and though he had contented himself with simple claret before nothing now but the most precious burgundy would serve his purpose
our company was soon encreased by the addition of several gentlemen from the gamingtable most of whom as i afterwards found came not to the tavern to drink but in the way of business for the true gamesters pretended to be ill and refused their glass while they plied heartily two young fellows who were to be afterwards pillaged as indeed they were without mercy
of this plunder i had the good fortune to be a sharer though i was not yet let into the secret
there was one remarkable accident attended this tavern play for the money by degrees totally disappeared so that though at the beginning the table was half covered with gold yet before the play ended which it did not till the next day being sunday at noon there was scarce a single guinea to be seen on the table and this was the stranger as every person present except myself declared he had lost and what was become of the money unless the devil himself carried it away is difficult to determine  most certainly he did says partridge for evil spirits can carry away anything without being seen though there were never so many folk in the room and i should not have been surprized if he had carried away all the company of a set of wicked wretches who were at play in sermon time
and i could tell you a true story if i would where the devil took a man out of bed from another man's wife and carried him away through the keyhole of the door
i've seen the very house where it was done and nobody hath lived in it these thirty years  though jones was a little offended by the impertinence of partridge he could not however avoid smiling at his simplicity
the stranger did the same and then proceeded with his story as will be seen in the next chapter
chapter xiii
in which the foregoing story is farther continued
my fellowcollegiate had now entered me in a new scene of life
i soon became acquainted with the whole fraternity of sharpers and was let into their secrets i mean into the knowledge of those gross cheats which are proper to impose upon the raw and unexperienced for there are some tricks of a finer kind which are known only to a few of the gang who are at the head of their profession a degree of honour beyond my expectation for drink to which i was immoderately addicted and the natural warmth of my passions prevented me from arriving at any great success in an art which requires as much coolness as the most austere school of philosophy
mr watson with whom i now lived in the closest amity had unluckily the former failing to a very great excess so that instead of making a fortune by his profession as some others did he was alternately rich and poor and was often obliged to surrender to his cooler friends over a bottle which they never tasted that plunder that he had taken from culls at the public table
however we both made a shift to pick up an uncomfortable livelihood and for two years i continued of the calling during which time i tasted all the varieties of fortune sometimes flourishing in affluence and at others being obliged to struggle with almost incredible difficulties
today wallowing in luxury and tomorrow reduced to the coarsest and most homely fare
my fine clothes being often on my back in the evening and at the pawnshop the next morning
one night as i was returning pennyless from the gamingtable i observed a very great disturbance and a large mob gathered together in the street
as i was in no danger from pickpockets i ventured into the croud where upon enquiry i found that a man had been robbed and very ill used by some ruffians
the wounded man appeared very bloody and seemed scarce able to support himself on his legs
as i had not therefore been deprived of my humanity by my present life and conversation though they had left me very little of either honesty or shame i immediately offered my assistance to the unhappy person who thankfully accepted it and putting himself under my conduct begged me to convey him to some tavern where he might send for a surgeon being as he said faint with loss of blood
he seemed indeed highly pleased at finding one who appeared in the dress of a gentleman for as to all the rest of the company present their outside was such that he could not wisely place any confidence in them
i took the poor man by the arm and led him to the tavern where we kept our rendezvous as it happened to be the nearest at hand
a surgeon happening luckily to be in the house immediately attended and applied himself to dressing his wounds which i had the pleasure to hear were not likely to be mortal
the surgeon having very expeditiously and dextrously finished his business began to enquire in what part of the town the wounded man lodged who answered that he was come to town that very morning that his horse was at an inn in piccadilly and that he had no other lodging and very little or no acquaintance in town'
this surgeon whose name i have forgot though i remember it began with an r had the first character in his profession and was serjeantsurgeon to the king
he had moreover many good qualities and was a very generous goodnatured man and ready to do any service to his fellowcreatures
he offered his patient the use of his chariot to carry him to his inn and at the same time whispered in his ear that if he wanted any money he would furnish him'
the poor man was not now capable of returning thanks for this generous offer for having had his eyes for some time stedfastly on me he threw himself back in his chair crying oh my son
my son'
and then fainted away
many of the people present imagined this accident had happened through his loss of blood but i who at the same time began to recollect the features of my father was now confirmed in my suspicion and satisfied that it was he himself who appeared before me
i presently ran to him raised him in my arms and kissed his cold lips with the utmost eagerness
here i must draw a curtain over a scene which i cannot describe for though i did not lose my being as my father for a while did my senses were however so overpowered with affright and surprize that i am a stranger to what passed during some minutes and indeed till my father had again recovered from his swoon and i found myself in his arms both tenderly embracing each other while the tears trickled apace down the cheeks of each of us
most of those present seemed affected by this scene which we who might be considered as the actors in it were desirous of removing from the eyes of all spectators as fast as we could my father therefore accepted the kind offer of the surgeon's chariot and i attended him in it to his inn
when we were alone together he gently upbraided me with having neglected to write to him during so long a time but entirely omitted the mention of that crime which had occasioned it
he then informed me of my mother's death and insisted on my returning home with him saying that he had long suffered the greatest anxiety on my account that he knew not whether he had most feared my death or wished it since he had so many more dreadful apprehensions for me
at last he said a neighbouring gentleman who had just recovered a son from the same place informed him where i was and that to reclaim me from this course of life was the sole cause of his journey to london'
he thanked heaven he had succeeded so far as to find me out by means of an accident which had like to have proved fatal to him and had the pleasure to think he partly owed his preservation to my humanity with which he profest himself to be more delighted than he should have been with my filial piety if i had known that the object of all my care was my own father
vice had not so depraved my heart as to excite in it an insensibility of so much paternal affection though so unworthily bestowed
i presently promised to obey his commands in my return home with him as soon as he was able to travel which indeed he was in a very few days by the assistance of that excellent surgeon who had undertaken his cure
the day preceding my father's journey before which time i scarce ever left him i went to take my leave of some of my most intimate acquaintance particularly of mr watson who dissuaded me from burying myself as he called it out of a simple compliance with the fond desires of a foolish old fellow
such sollicitations however had no effect and i once more saw my own home
my father now greatly sollicited me to think of marriage but my inclinations were utterly averse to any such thoughts
i had tasted of love already and perhaps you know the extravagant excesses of that most tender and most violent passionhere the old gentleman paused and looked earnestly at jones whose countenance within a minute's space displayed the extremities of both red and white
upon which the old man without making any observations renewed his narrative
being now provided with all the necessaries of life i betook myself once again to study and that with a more inordinate application than i had ever done formerly
the books which now employed my time solely were those as well antient as modern which treat of true philosophy a word which is by many thought to be the subject only of farce and ridicule
i now read over the works of aristotle and plato with the rest of those inestimable treasures which antient greece had bequeathed to the world
these authors though they instructed me in no science by which men may promise to themselves to acquire the least riches or worldly power taught me however the art of despising the highest acquisitions of both
they elevate the mind and steel and harden it against the capricious invasions of fortune
they not only instruct in the knowledge of wisdom but confirm men in her habits and demonstrate plainly that this must be our guide if we propose ever to arrive at the greatest worldly happiness or to defend ourselves with any tolerable security against the misery which everywhere surrounds and invests us
to this i added another study compared to which all the philosophy taught by the wisest heathens is little better than a dream and is indeed as full of vanity as the silliest jester ever pleased to represent it
this is that divine wisdom which is alone to be found in the holy scriptures for they impart to us the knowledge and assurance of things much more worthy our attention than all which this world can offer to our acceptance of things which heaven itself hath condescended to reveal to us and to the smallest knowledge of which the highest human wit unassisted could never ascend
i began now to think all the time i had spent with the best heathen writers was little more than labour lost for however pleasant and delightful their lessons may be or however adequate to the right regulation of our conduct with respect to this world only yet when compared with the glory revealed in scripture their highest documents will appear as trifling and of as little consequence as the rules by which children regulate their childish little games and pastime
true it is that philosophy makes us wiser but christianity makes us better men
philosophy elevates and steels the mind christianity softens and sweetens it
the former makes us the objects of human admiration the latter of divine love
that insures us a temporal but this an eternal happinessbut i am afraid i tire you with my rhapsody  not at all cries partridge lud forbid we should be tired with good things  i had spent continued the stranger about four years in the most delightful manner to myself totally given up to contemplation and entirely unembarrassed with the affairs of the world when i lost the best of fathers and one whom i so entirely loved that my grief at his loss exceeds all description
i now abandoned my books and gave myself up for a whole month to the effects of melancholy and despair
time however the best physician of the mind at length brought me reliefay ay tempus edax rerum said partridgei then  continued the stranger betook myself again to my former studies which i may say perfected my cure for philosophy and religion may be called the exercises of the mind and when this is disordered they are as wholesome as exercise can be to a distempered body
they do indeed produce similar effects with exercise for they strengthen and confirm the mind till man becomes in the noble strain of horace       fortis et in seipso totus teres atque rotundus      externi ne quid valeat per laeve morari      in quem manca ruit semper fortuna        firm in himself who on himself relies      polish'd and round who runs his proper course      and breaks misfortunes with superior forcemr francis
here jones smiled at some conceit which intruded itself into his imagination but the stranger i believe perceived it not and proceeded thus  my circumstances were now greatly altered by the death of that best of men for my brother who was now become master of the house differed so widely from me in his inclinations and our pursuits in life had been so very various that we were the worst of company to each other but what made our living together still more disagreeable was the little harmony which could subsist between the few who resorted to me and the numerous train of sportsmen who often attended my brother from the field to the table for such fellows besides the noise and nonsense with which they persecute the ears of sober men endeavour always to attack them with affront and contempt
this was so much the case that neither i myself nor my friends could ever sit down to a meal with them without being treated with derision because we were unacquainted with the phrases of sportsmen
for men of true learning and almost universal knowledge always compassionate the ignorance of others but fellows who excel in some little low contemptible art are always certain to despise those who are unacquainted with that art
in short we soon separated and i went by the advice of a physician to drink the bath waters for my violent affliction added to a sedentary life had thrown me into a kind of paralytic disorder for which those waters are accounted an almost certain cure
the second day after my arrival as i was walking by the river the sun shone so intensely hot though it was early in the year that i retired to the shelter of some willows and sat down by the river side
here i had not been seated long before i heard a person on the other side of the willows sighing and bemoaning himself bitterly
on a sudden having uttered a most impious oath he cried i am resolved to bear it no longer' and directly threw himself into the water
i immediately started and ran towards the place calling at the same time as loudly as i could for assistance
an angler happened luckily to be afishing a little below me though some very high sedge had hid him from my sight
he immediately came up and both of us together not without some hazard of our lives drew the body to the shore
at first we perceived no sign of life remaining but having held the body up by the heels for we soon had assistance enough it discharged a vast quantity of water at the mouth and at length began to discover some symptoms of breathing and a little afterwards to move both its hands and its legs
an apothecary who happened to be present among others advised that the body which seemed now to have pretty well emptied itself of water and which began to have many convulsive motions should be directly taken up and carried into a warm bed
this was accordingly performed the apothecary and myself attending
as we were going towards an inn for we knew not the man's lodgings luckily a woman met us who after some violent screaming told us that the gentleman lodged at her house
when i had seen the man safely deposited there i left him to the care of the apothecary who i suppose used all the right methods with him for the next morning i heard he had perfectly recovered his senses
i then went to visit him intending to search out as well as i could the cause of his having attempted so desperate an act and to prevent as far as i was able his pursuing such wicked intentions for the future
i was no sooner admitted into his chamber than we both instantly knew each other for who should this person be but my good friend mr watson
here i will not trouble you with what past at our first interview for i would avoid prolixity as much as possiblepray let us hear all cries partridge i want mightily to know what brought him to bath  you shall hear everything material answered the stranger and then proceeded to relate what we shall proceed to write after we have given a short breathing time to both ourselves and the reader
chapter xiv
in which the man of the hill concludes his history
mr watson continued the stranger very freely acquainted me that the unhappy situation of his circumstances occasioned by a tide of ill luck had in a manner forced him to a resolution of destroying himself
i now began to argue very seriously with him in opposition to this heathenish or indeed diabolical principle of the lawfulness of selfmurder and said everything which occurred to me on the subject but to my great concern it seemed to have very little effect on him
he seemed not at all to repent of what he had done and gave me reason to fear he would soon make a second attempt of the like horrible kind
when i had finished my discourse instead of endeavouring to answer my arguments he looked me stedfastly in the face and with a smile said you are strangely altered my good friend since i remember you
i question whether any of our bishops could make a better argument against suicide than you have entertained me with but unless you can find somebody who will lend me a cool hundred i must either hang or drown or starve and in my opinion the last death is the most terrible of the three'
i answered him very gravely that i was indeed altered since i had seen him last
that i had found leisure to look into my follies and to repent of them
i then advised him to pursue the same steps and at last concluded with an assurance that i myself would lend him a hundred pound if it would be of any service to his affairs and he would not put it into the power of a die to deprive him of it
mr watson who seemed almost composed in slumber by the former part of my discourse was roused by the latter
he seized my hand eagerly gave me a thousand thanks and declared i was a friend indeed adding that he hoped i had a better opinion of him than to imagine he had profited so little by experience as to put any confidence in those damned dice which had so often deceived him
no no' cries he let me but once handsomely be set up again and if ever fortune makes a broken merchant of me afterwards i will forgive her'
i very well understood the language of setting up and broken merchant
i therefore said to him with a very grave face mr watson you must endeavour to find out some business or employment by which you may procure yourself a livelihood and i promise you could i see any probability of being repaid hereafter i would advance a much larger sum than what you have mentioned to equip you in any fair and honourable calling but as to gaming besides the baseness and wickedness of making it a profession you are really to my own knowledge unfit for it and it will end in your certain ruin
why now that's strange' answered he neither you nor any of my friends would ever allow me to know anything of the matter and yet i believe i am as good a hand at every game as any of you all and i heartily wish i was to play with you only for your whole fortune i should desire no better sport and i would let you name your game into the bargain but come my dear boy have you the hundred in your pocket  i answered i had only a bill for  which i delivered him and promised to bring him the rest next morning and after giving him a little more advice took my leave
i was indeed better than my word for i returned to him that very afternoon
when i entered the room i found him sitting up in his bed at cards with a notorious gamester
this sight you will imagine shocked me not a little to which i may add the mortification of seeing my bill delivered by him to his antagonist and thirty guineas only given in exchange for it
the other gamester presently quitted the room and then watson declared he was ashamed to see me but' says he i find luck runs so damnably against me that i will resolve to leave off play for ever
i have thought of the kind proposal you made me ever since and i promise you there shall be no fault in me if i do not put it in execution'
though i had no great faith in his promises i produced him the remainder of the hundred in consequence of my own for which he gave me a note which was all i ever expected to see in return for my money
we were prevented from any further discourse at present by the arrival of the apothecary who with much joy in his countenance and without even asking his patient how he did proclaimed there was great news arrived in a letter to himself which he said would shortly be public that the duke of monmouth was landed in the west with a vast army of dutch and that another vast fleet hovered over the coast of norfolk and was to make a descent there in order to favour the duke's enterprize with a diversion on that side'
this apothecary was one of the greatest politicians of his time
he was more delighted with the most paultry packet than with the best patient and the highest joy he was capable of he received from having a piece of news in his possession an hour or two sooner than any other person in the town
his advices however were seldom authentic for he would swallow almost anything as a trutha humour which many made use of to impose upon him
thus it happened with what he at present communicated for it was known within a short time afterwards that the duke was really landed but that his army consisted only of a few attendants and as to the diversion in norfolk it was entirely false
the apothecary staid no longer in the room than while he acquainted us with his news and then without saying a syllable to his patient on any other subject departed to spread his advices all over the town
events of this nature in the public are generally apt to eclipse all private concerns
our discourse therefore now became entirely political
 for my own part i had been for some time very seriously affected with the danger to which the protestant religion was so visibly exposed under a popish prince and thought the apprehension of it alone sufficient to justify that insurrection for no real security can ever be found against the persecuting spirit of popery when armed with power except the depriving it of that power as woeful experience presently showed
you know how king james behaved after getting the better of this attempt how little he valued either his royal word or coronation oath or the liberties and rights of his people
but all had not the sense to foresee this at first and therefore the duke of monmouth was weakly supported yet all could feel when the evil came upon them and therefore all united at last to drive out that king against whose exclusion a great party among us had so warmly contended during the reign of his brother and for whom they now fought with such zeal and affection  what you say interrupted jones is very true and it has often struck me as the most wonderful thing i ever read of in history that so soon after this convincing experience which brought our whole nation to join so unanimously in expelling king james for the preservation of our religion and liberties there should be a party among us mad enough to desire the placing his family again on the throne you are not in earnest answered the old man there can be no such party
as bad an opinion as i have of mankind i cannot believe them infatuated to such a degree
there may be some hotheaded papists led by their priests to engage in this desperate cause and think it a holy war but that protestants that are members of the church of england should be such apostates such felos de se i cannot believe it no no young man unacquainted as i am with what has past in the world for these last thirty years i cannot be so imposed upon as to credit so foolish a tale but i see you have a mind to sport with my ignorancecan it be possible replied jones that you have lived so much out of the world as not to know that during that time there have been two rebellions in favour of the son of king james one of which is now actually raging in the very heart of the kingdom at these words the old gentleman started up and in a most solemn tone of voice conjured jones by his maker to tell him if what he said was really true which the other as solemnly affirming he walked several turns about the room in a profound silence then cried then laughed and at last fell down on his knees and blessed god in a loud thanksgiving prayer for having delivered him from all society with human nature which could be capable of such monstrous extravagances
after which being reminded by jones that he had broke off his story he resumed it again in this manner  as mankind in the days i was speaking of was not yet arrived at that pitch of madness which i find they are capable of now and which to be sure i have only escaped by living alone and at a distance from the contagion there was a considerable rising in favour of monmouth and my principles strongly inclining me to take the same part i determined to join him and mr watson from different motives concurring in the same resolution for the spirit of a gamester will carry a man as far upon such an occasion as the spirit of patriotism we soon provided ourselves with all necessaries and went to the duke at bridgewater
the unfortunate event of this enterprize you are i conclude as well acquainted with as myself
i escaped together with mr watson from the battle at sedgemore in which action i received a slight wound
we rode near forty miles together on the exeter road and then abandoning our horses scrambled as well as we could through the fields and byeroads till we arrived at a little wild hut on a common where a poor old woman took all the care of us she could and dressed my wound with salve which quickly healed it  pray sir where was the wound says partridge
the stranger satisfied him it was in his arm and then continued his narrative
here sir said he mr watson left me the next morning in order as he pretended to get us some provision from the town of collumpton butcan i relate it or can you believe itthis mr watson this friend this base barbarous treacherous villain betrayed me to a party of horse belonging to king james and at his return delivered me into their hands
the soldiers being six in number had now seized me and were conducting me to taunton gaol but neither my present situation nor the apprehensions of what might happen to me were half so irksome to my mind as the company of my false friend who having surrendered himself was likewise considered as a prisoner though he was better treated as being to make his peace at my expense
he at first endeavoured to excuse his treachery but when he received nothing but scorn and upbraiding from me he soon changed his note abused me as the most atrocious and malicious rebel and laid all his own guilt to my charge who as he declared had solicited and even threatened him to make him take up arms against his gracious as well as lawful sovereign
this false evidence for in reality he had been much the forwarder of the two stung me to the quick and raised an indignation scarce conceivable by those who have not felt it
however fortune at length took pity on me for as we were got a little beyond wellington in a narrow lane my guards received a false alarm that near fifty of the enemy were at hand upon which they shifted for themselves and left me and my betrayer to do the same
that villain immediately ran from me and i am glad he did or i should have certainly endeavoured though i had no arms to have executed vengeance on his baseness
i was now once more at liberty and immediately withdrawing from the highway into the fields i travelled on scarce knowing which way i went and making it my chief care to avoid all public roads and all townsnay even the most homely houses for i imagined every human creature whom i saw desirous of betraying me
at last after rambling several days about the country during which the fields afforded me the same bed and the same food which nature bestows on our savage brothers of the creation i at length arrived at this place where the solitude and wildness of the country invited me to fix my abode
the first person with whom i took up my habitation was the mother of this old woman with whom i remained concealed till the news of the glorious revolution put an end to all my apprehensions of danger and gave me an opportunity of once more visiting my own home and of enquiring a little into my affairs which i soon settled as agreeably to my brother as to myself having resigned everything to him for which he paid me the sum of a thousand pounds and settled on me an annuity for life
his behaviour in this last instance as in all others was selfish and ungenerous
i could not look on him as my friend nor indeed did he desire that i should so i presently took my leave of him as well as of my other acquaintance and from that day to this my history is little better than a blank  and is it possible sir said jones that you can have resided here from that day to thiso no sir answered the gentleman i have been a great traveller and there are few parts of europe with which i am not acquainted i have not sir cried jones the assurance to ask it of you now indeed it would be cruel after so much breath as you have already spent but you will give me leave to wish for some further opportunity of hearing the excellent observations which a man of your sense and knowledge of the world must have made in so long a course of travelsindeed young gentleman answered the stranger i will endeavour to satisfy your curiosity on this head likewise as far as i am able jones attempted fresh apologies but was prevented and while he and partridge sat with greedy and impatient ears the stranger proceeded as in the next chapter
 the rest of this paragraph and the two following paragraphs   in the first edition were as follows    for my own part i had been for some time very seriously affected   with the danger to which the protestant religion was so visibly   exposed that nothing but the immediate interposition of providence   seemed capable of preserving it for king james had indeed declared   war against the protestant cause
he had brought known papists into   the army and attempted to bring them into the church and into the   university
popish priests swarmed through the nation appeared   publicly in their habits and boasted that they should shortly walk   in procession through the streets
our own clergy were forbid to   preach against popery and bishops were ordered to supend those who   did and to do the business at once an illegal ecclesiastical   commission was erected little inferior to an inquisition of which   probably it was intended to be the ringleader
thus as our duty to   the king can never be called more than our second duty he had   discharged us from this by making it incompatible with our   preserving the first which is surely to heaven
besides this he   had dissolved his subjects from their allegiance by breaking his   coronation oath to which their allegiance is annexed for he had   imprisoned bishops because they would not give up their religion   and turned out judges because they would not absolutely surrender   the law into his hands nay he seized this himself and when he   claimed a dispensing power he declared himself in fact as   absolute as any tyrant ever was or can be
i have recapitulated   these matters in full lest some of them should have been omitted in   history and i think nothing less than such provocations as i have   here mentioned nothing less than certain and imminent danger to   their religion and liberties can justify or even mitigate the   dreadful sin of rebellion in any people    i promise you sir says jones all these facts and more i have   read in history but i will tell you a fact which is not yet   recorded and of which i suppose you are ignorant
there is actually   now a rebellion on foot in this kingdom in favour of the son of that   very king james a professed papist more bigoted if possible than   his father and this carried on by protestants against a king who   hath never in one single instance made the least invasion on our   liberties    prodigious indeed answered the stranger
you tell me what would   be incredible of a nation which did not deserve the character that   virgil gives of a woman varium et mutabile semper
surely this is   to be unworthy of the care which providence seems to have taken of   us in the preservation of our religion against the powerful designs   and constant machinations of popery a preservation so strange and   unaccountable that i almost think we may appeal to it as to a   miracle for the proof of its holiness
prodigious indeed
a   protestant rebellion in favour of a popish prince
the folly of   mankind is as wonderful as their knaverybut to conclude my story   i resolved to take arms in defence of my country of my religion   and my liberty and mr watson joined in the same resolution
we   soon provided ourselves with an necessaries and joined the duke at   bridgewater    the unfortunate event of this enterprise you are perhaps better   acquainted with than myself
i escaped together with mr watson from   the battle at sedgemore    chapter xv
a brief history of europe and a curious discourse between mr jones and the man of the hill
in italy the landlords are very silent
in france they are more talkative but yet civil
in germany and holland they are generally very impertinent
and as for their honesty i believe it is pretty equal in all those countries
the laquais  louange are sure to lose no opportunity of cheating you and as for the postilions i think they are pretty much alike all the world over
these sir are the observations on men which i made in my travels for these were the only men i ever conversed with
my design when i went abroad was to divert myself by seeing the wondrous variety of prospects beasts birds fishes insects and vegetables with which god has been pleased to enrich the several parts of this globe a variety which as it must give great pleasure to a contemplative beholder so doth it admirably display the power and wisdom and goodness of the creator
indeed to say the truth there is but one work in his whole creation that doth him any dishonour and with that i have long since avoided holding any conversation  you will pardon me cries jones but i have always imagined that there is in this very work you mention as great variety as in all the rest for besides the difference of inclination customs and climates have i am told introduced the utmost diversity into human nature  very little indeed answered the other those who travel in order to acquaint themselves with the different manners of men might spare themselves much pains by going to a carnival at venice for there they will see at once all which they can discover in the several courts of europe
the same hypocrisy the same fraud in short the same follies and vices dressed in different habits
in spain these are equipped with much gravity and in italy with vast splendor
in france a knave is dressed like a fop and in the northern countries like a sloven
but human nature is everywhere the same everywhere the object of detestation and scorn
as for my own part i past through all these nations as you perhaps may have done through a croud at a shewjostling to get by them holding my nose with one hand and defending my pockets with the other without speaking a word to any of them while i was pressing on to see what i wanted to see which however entertaining it might be in itself scarce made me amends for the trouble the company gave me  did not you find some of the nations among which you travelled less troublesome to you than others said jones
o yes replied the old man the turks were much more tolerable to me than the christians for they are men of profound taciturnity and never disturb a stranger with questions
now and then indeed they bestow a short curse upon him or spit in his face as he walks the streets but then they have done with him and a man may live an age in their country without hearing a dozen words from them
but of all the people i ever saw heaven defend me from the french
with their damned prate and civilities and doing the honour of their nation to strangers as they are pleased to call it but indeed setting forth their own vanity they are so troublesome that i had infinitely rather pass my life with the hottentots than set my foot in paris again
they are a nasty people but their nastiness is mostly without whereas in france and some other nations that i won't name it is all within and makes them stink much more to my reason than that of hottentots does to my nose
thus sir i have ended the history of my life for as to all that series of years during which i have lived retired here it affords no variety to entertain you and may be almost considered as one day
 the retirement has been so compleat that i could hardly have enjoyed a more absolute solitude in the deserts of the thebais than here in the midst of this populous kingdom
as i have no estate i am plagued with no tenants or stewards my annuity is paid me pretty regularly as indeed it ought to be for it is much less than what i might have expected in return for what i gave up
visits i admit none and the old woman who keeps my house knows that her place entirely depends upon her saving me all the trouble of buying the things that i want keeping off all sollicitation or business from me and holding her tongue whenever i am within hearing
as my walks are all by night i am pretty secure in this wild unfrequented place from meeting any company
some few persons i have met by chance and sent them home heartily frighted as from the oddness of my dress and figure they took me for a ghost or a hobgoblin
but what has happened tonight shows that even here i cannot be safe from the villany of men for without your assistance i had not only been robbed but very probably murdered     the rest of this paragraph is omitted in the third edition  jones thanked the stranger for the trouble he had taken in relating his story and then expressed some wonder how he could possibly endure a life of such solitude in which says he you may well complain of the want of variety
indeed i am astonished how you have filled up or rather killed so much of your time  i am not at all surprized answered the other that to one whose affections and thoughts are fixed on the world my hours should appear to have wanted employment in this place but there is one single act for which the whole life of man is infinitely too short what time can suffice for the contemplation and worship of that glorious immortal and eternal being among the works of whose stupendous creation not only this globe but even those numberless luminaries which we may here behold spangling all the sky though they should many of them be suns lighting different systems of worlds may possibly appear but as a few atoms opposed to the whole earth which we inhabit
can a man who by divine meditations is admitted as it were into the conversation of this ineffable incomprehensible majesty think days or years or ages too long for the continuance of so ravishing an honour
shall the trifling amusements the palling pleasures the silly business of the world roll away our hours too swiftly from us and shall the pace of time seem sluggish to a mind exercised in studies so high so important and so glorious
as no time is sufficient so no place is improper for this great concern
on what object can we cast our eyes which may not inspire us with ideas of his power of his wisdom and of his goodness
it is not necessary that the rising sun should dart his fiery glories over the eastern horizon nor that the boisterous winds should rush from their caverns and shake the lofty forest nor that the opening clouds should pour their deluges on the plains it is not necessary i say that any of these should proclaim his majesty there is not an insect not a vegetable of so low an order in the creation as not to be honoured with bearing marks of the attributes of its great creator marks not only of his power but of his wisdom and goodness
man alone the king of this globe the last and greatest work of the supreme being below the sun man alone hath basely dishonoured his own nature and by dishonesty cruelty ingratitude and treachery hath called his maker's goodness in question by puzzling us to account how a benevolent being should form so foolish and so vile an animal
yet this is the being from whose conversation you think i suppose that i have been unfortunately restrained and without whose blessed society life in your opinion must be tedious and insipid  in the former part of what you said replied jones i most heartily and readily concur but i believe as well as hope that the abhorrence which you express for mankind in the conclusion is much too general
indeed you here fall into an error which in my little experience i have observed to be a very common one by taking the character of mankind from the worst and basest among them whereas indeed as an excellent writer observes nothing should be esteemed as characteristical of a species but what is to be found among the best and most perfect individuals of that species
this error i believe is generally committed by those who from want of proper caution in the choice of their friends and acquaintance have suffered injuries from bad and worthless men two or three instances of which are very unjustly charged on all human nature  i think i had experience enough of it answered the other my first mistress and my first friend betrayed me in the basest manner and in matters which threatened to be of the worst of consequenceseven to bring me to a shameful death  but you will pardon me cries jones if i desire you to reflect who that mistress and who that friend were
what better my good sir could be expected in love derived from the stews or in friendship first produced and nourished at the gamingtable
to take the characters of women from the former instance or of men from the latter would be as unjust as to assert that air is a nauseous and unwholesome element because we find it so in a jakes
i have lived but a short time in the world and yet have known men worthy of the highest friendship and women of the highest love  alas
young man answered the stranger you have lived you confess but a very short time in the world i was somewhat older than you when i was of the same opinion  you might have remained so still replies jones if you had not been unfortunate i will venture to say incautious in the placing your affections
if there was indeed much more wickedness in the world than there is it would not prove such general assertions against human nature since much of this arrives by mere accident and many a man who commits evil is not totally bad and corrupt in his heart
in truth none seem to have any title to assert human nature to be necessarily and universally evil but those whose own minds afford them one instance of this natural depravity which is not i am convinced your case  and such said the stranger will be always the most backward to assert any such thing
knaves will no more endeavour to persuade us of the baseness of mankind than a highwayman will inform you that there are thieves on the road
this would indeed be a method to put you on your guard and to defeat their own purposes
for which reason though knaves as i remember are very apt to abuse particular persons yet they never cast any reflection on human nature in general the old gentleman spoke this so warmly that as jones despaired of making a convert and was unwilling to offend he returned no answer
the day now began to send forth its first streams of light when jones made an apology to the stranger for having staid so long and perhaps detained him from his rest
the stranger answered he never wanted rest less than at present for that day and night were indifferent seasons to him and that he commonly made use of the former for the time of his repose and of the latter for his walks and lucubrations
however said he it is now a most lovely morning and if you can bear any longer to be without your own rest or food i will gladly entertain you with the sight of some very fine prospects which i believe you have not yet seen  jones very readily embraced this offer and they immediately set forward together from the cottage
as for partridge he had fallen into a profound repose just as the stranger had finished his story for his curiosity was satisfied and the subsequent discourse was not forcible enough in its operation to conjure down the charms of sleep
jones therefore left him to enjoy his nap and as the reader may perhaps be at this season glad of the same favour we will here put an end to the eighth book of our history
book ix
containing twelve hours
chapter i
of those who lawfully may and of those who may not write such histories as this
among other good uses for which i have thought proper to institute these several introductory chapters i have considered them as a kind of mark or stamp which may hereafter enable a very indifferent reader to distinguish what is true and genuine in this historic kind of writing from what is false and counterfeit
indeed it seems likely that some such mark may shortly become necessary since the favourable reception which two or three authors have lately procured for their works of this nature from the public will probably serve as an encouragement to many others to undertake the like
thus a swarm of foolish novels and monstrous romances will be produced either to the great impoverishing of booksellers or to the great loss of time and depravation of morals in the reader nay often to the spreading of scandal and calumny and to the prejudice of the characters of many worthy and honest people
i question not but the ingenious author of the spectator was principally induced to prefix greek and latin mottos to every paper from the same consideration of guarding against the pursuit of those scribblers who having no talents of a writer but what is taught by the writingmaster are yet nowise afraid nor ashamed to assume the same titles with the greatest genius than their good brother in the fable was of braying in the lion's skin
by the device therefore of his motto it became impracticable for any man to presume to imitate the spectators without understanding at least one sentence in the learned languages
in the same manner i have now secured myself from the imitation of those who are utterly incapable of any degree of reflection and whose learning is not equal to an essay
i would not be here understood to insinuate that the greatest merit of such historical productions can ever lie in these introductory chapters but in fact those parts which contain mere narrative only afford much more encouragement to the pen of an imitator than those which are composed of observation and reflection
here i mean such imitators as rowe was of shakespear or as horace hints some of the romans were of cato by bare feet and sour faces
to invent good stories and to tell them well are possibly very rare talents and yet i have observed few persons who have scrupled to aim at both and if we examine the romances and novels with which the world abounds i think we may fairly conclude that most of the authors would not have attempted to show their teeth if the expression may be allowed me in any other way of writing nor could indeed have strung together a dozen sentences on any other subject whatever
scribimus indocti doctique passim        each desperate blockhead dares to write      verse is the trade of every living wightfrancis
may be more truly said of the historian and biographer than of any other species of writing for all the arts and sciences even criticism itself require some little degree of learning and knowledge
poetry indeed may perhaps be thought an exception but then it demands numbers or something like numbers whereas to the composition of novels and romances nothing is necessary but paper pens and ink with the manual capacity of using them
this i conceive their productions show to be the opinion of the authors themselves and this must be the opinion of their readers if indeed there be any such
hence we are to derive that universal contempt which the world who always denominate the whole from the majority have cast on all historical writers who do not draw their materials from records
and it is the apprehension of this contempt that hath made us so cautiously avoid the term romance a name with which we might otherwise have been well enough contented
though as we have good authority for all our characters no less indeed than the vast authentic doomsdaybook of nature as is elsewhere hinted our labours have sufficient title to the name of history
certainly they deserve some distinction from those works which one of the wittiest of men regarded only as proceeding from a pruritus or indeed rather from a looseness of the brain
but besides the dishonour which is thus cast on one of the most useful as well as entertaining of all kinds of writing there is just reason to apprehend that by encouraging such authors we shall propagate much dishonour of another kind i mean to the characters of many good and valuable members of society for the dullest writers no more than the dullest companions are always inoffensive
they have both enough of language to be indecent and abusive
and surely if the opinion just above cited be true we cannot wonder that works so nastily derived should be nasty themselves or have a tendency to make others so
to prevent therefore for the future such intemperate abuses of leisure of letters and of the liberty of the press especially as the world seems at present to be more than usually threatened with them i shall here venture to mention some qualifications every one of which are in a pretty high degree necessary to this order of historians
the first is genius without a full vein of which no study says horace can avail us
by genius i would understand that power or rather those powers of the mind which are capable of penetrating into all things within our reach and knowledge and of distinguishing their essential differences
these are no other than invention and judgment and they are both called by the collective name of genius as they are of those gifts of nature which we bring with us into the world
concerning each of which many seem to have fallen into very great errors for by invention i believe is generally understood a creative faculty which would indeed prove most romance writers to have the highest pretensions to it whereas by invention is really meant no more and so the word signifies than discovery or finding out or to explain it at large a quick and sagacious penetration into the true essence of all the objects of our contemplation
this i think can rarely exist without the concomitancy of judgment for how we can be said to have discovered the true essence of two things without discerning their difference seems to me hard to conceive
now this last is the undisputed province of judgment and yet some few men of wit have agreed with all the dull fellows in the world in representing these two to have been seldom or never the property of one and the same person
but though they should be so they are not sufficient for our purpose without a good share of learning for which i could again cite the authority of horace and of many others if any was necessary to prove that tools are of no service to a workman when they are not sharpened by art or when he wants rules to direct him in his work or hath no matter to work upon
all these uses are supplied by learning for nature can only furnish us with capacity or as i have chose to illustrate it with the tools of our profession learning must fit them for use must direct them in it and lastly must contribute part at least of the materials
a competent knowledge of history and of the belleslettres is here absolutely necessary and without this share of knowledge at least to affect the character of an historian is as vain as to endeavour at building a house without timber or mortar or brick or stone
homer and milton who though they added the ornament of numbers to their works were both historians of our order were masters of all the learning of their times
again there is another sort of knowledge beyond the power of learning to bestow and this is to be had by conversation
so necessary is this to the understanding the characters of men that none are more ignorant of them than those learned pedants whose lives have been entirely consumed in colleges and among books for however exquisitely human nature may have been described by writers the true practical system can be learnt only in the world
indeed the like happens in every other kind of knowledge
neither physic nor law are to be practically known from books
nay the farmer the planter the gardener must perfect by experience what he hath acquired the rudiments of by reading
how accurately soever the ingenious mr miller may have described the plant he himself would advise his disciple to see it in the garden
as we must perceive that after the nicest strokes of a shakespear or a jonson of a wycherly or an otway some touches of nature will escape the reader which the judicious action of a garrick of a cibber or a clive can convey to him so on the real stage the character shows himself in a stronger and bolder light than he can be described
and if this be the case in those fine and nervous descriptions which great authors themselves have taken from life how much more strongly will it hold when the writer himself takes his lines not from nature but from books
such characters are only the faint copy of a copy and can have neither the justness nor spirit of an original
 there is a peculiar propriety in mentioning this great actor   and these two most justly celebrated actresses in this place as   they have all formed themselves on the study of nature only and not   on the imitation of their predecessors
hence they have been able to   excel all who have gone before them a degree of merit which the   servile herd of imitators can never possibly arrive at
now this conversation in our historian must be universal that is with all ranks and degrees of men for the knowledge of what is called high life will not instruct him in low nor e converso will his being acquainted with the inferior part of mankind teach him the manners of the superior
and though it may be thought that the knowledge of either may sufficiently enable him to describe at least that in which he hath been conversant yet he will even here fall greatly short of perfection for the follies of either rank do in reality illustrate each other
for instance the affectation of high life appears more glaring and ridiculous from the simplicity of the low and again the rudeness and barbarity of this latter strikes with much stronger ideas of absurdity when contrasted with and opposed to the politeness which controuls the former
besides to say the truth the manners of our historian will be improved by both these conversations for in the one he will easily find examples of plainness honesty and sincerity in the other of refinement elegance and a liberality of spirit which last quality i myself have scarce ever seen in men of low birth and education
nor will all the qualities i have hitherto given my historian avail him unless he have what is generally meant by a good heart and be capable of feeling
the author who will make me weep says horace must first weep himself
in reality no man can paint a distress well which he doth not feel while he is painting it nor do i doubt but that the most pathetic and affecting scenes have been writ with tears
in the same manner it is with the ridiculous
i am convinced i never make my reader laugh heartily but where i have laughed before him unless it should happen at any time that instead of laughing with me he should be inclined to laugh at me
perhaps this may have been the case at some passages in this chapter from which apprehension i will here put an end to it
chapter ii
containing a very surprizing adventure indeed which mr jones met with in his walk with the man of the hill
aurora now first opened her casement anglice the day began to break when jones walked forth in company with the stranger and mounted mazard hill of which they had no sooner gained the summit than one of the most noble prospects in the world presented itself to their view and which we would likewise present to the reader but for two reasons first we despair of making those who have seen this prospect admire our description secondly we very much doubt whether those who have not seen it would understand it
jones stood for some minutes fixed in one posture and directing his eyes towards the south upon which the old gentleman asked what he was looking at with so much attention
alas
sir answered he with a sigh i was endeavouring to trace out my own journey hither
good heavens
what a distance is gloucester from us
what a vast track of land must be between me and my own homeay ay young gentleman  cries the other and by your sighing from what you love better than your own home or i am mistaken
i perceive now the object of your contemplation is not within your sight and yet i fancy you have a pleasure in looking that way jones answered with a smile i find old friend you have not yet forgot the sensations of your youth
i own my thoughts were employed as you have guessed  they now walked to that part of the hill which looks to the northwest and which hangs over a vast and extensive wood
here they were no sooner arrived than they heard at a distance the most violent screams of a woman proceeding from the wood below them
jones listened a moment and then without saying a word to his companion for indeed the occasion seemed sufficiently pressing ran or rather slid down the hill and without the least apprehension or concern for his own safety made directly to the thicket whence the sound had issued
he had not entered far into the wood before he beheld a most shocking sight indeed a woman stript half naked under the hands of a ruffian who had put his garter round her neck and was endeavouring to draw her up to a tree
jones asked no questions at this interval but fell instantly upon the villain and made such good use of his trusty oaken stick that he laid him sprawling on the ground before he could defend himself indeed almost before he knew he was attacked nor did he cease the prosecution of his blows till the woman herself begged him to forbear saying she believed he had sufficiently done his business
the poor wretch then fell upon her knees to jones and gave him a thousand thanks for her deliverance
he presently lifted her up and told her he was highly pleased with the extraordinary accident which had sent him thither for her relief where it was so improbable she should find any adding that heaven seemed to have designed him as the happy instrument of her protection
nay answered she i could almost conceive you to be some good angel and to say the truth you look more like an angel than a man in my eye indeed he was a charming figure and if a very fine person and a most comely set of features adorned with youth health strength freshness spirit and goodnature can make a man resemble an angel he certainly had that resemblance
the redeemed captive had not altogether so much of the humanangelic species she seemed to be at least of the middle age nor had her face much appearance of beauty but her cloaths being torn from all the upper part of her body her breasts which were well formed and extremely white attracted the eyes of her deliverer and for a few moments they stood silent and gazing at each other till the ruffian on the ground beginning to move jones took the garter which had been intended for another purpose and bound both his hands behind him
and now on contemplating his face he discovered greatly to his surprize and perhaps not a little to his satisfaction this very person to be no other than ensign northerton
nor had the ensign forgotten his former antagonist whom he knew the moment he came to himself
his surprize was equal to that of jones but i conceive his pleasure was rather less on this occasion
jones helped northerton upon his legs and then looking him stedfastly in the face i fancy sir said he you did not expect to meet me any more in this world and i confess i had as little expectation to find you here
however fortune i see hath brought us once more together and hath given me satisfaction for the injury i have received even without my own knowledge  it is very much like a man of honour indeed answered northerton to take satisfaction by knocking a man down behind his back
neither am i capable of giving you satisfaction here as i have no sword but if you dare behave like a gentleman let us go where i can furnish myself with one and i will do by you as a man of honour ought  doth it become such a villain as you are cries jones to contaminate the name of honour by assuming it
but i shall waste no time in discourse with you
justice requires satisfaction of you now and shall have it then turning to the woman he asked her if she was near her home or if not whether she was acquainted with any house in the neighbourhood where she might procure herself some decent cloaths in order to proceed to a justice of the peace
she answered she was an entire stranger in that part of the world
jones then recollecting himself said he had a friend near who would direct them indeed he wondered at his not following but in fact the good man of the hill when our heroe departed sat himself down on the brow where though he had a gun in his hand he with great patience and unconcern had attended the issue
jones then stepping without the wood perceived the old man sitting as we have just described him he presently exerted his utmost agility and with surprizing expedition ascended the hill
the old man advised him to carry the woman to upton which he said was the nearest town and there he would be sure of furnishing her with all manner of conveniencies
jones having received his direction to the place took his leave of the man of the hill and desiring him to direct partridge the same way returned hastily to the wood
our heroe at his departure to make this enquiry of his friend had considered that as the ruffian's hands were tied behind him he was incapable of executing any wicked purposes on the poor woman
besides he knew he should not be beyond the reach of her voice and could return soon enough to prevent any mischief
he had moreover declared to the villain that if he attempted the least insult he would be himself immediately the executioner of vengeance on him
but jones unluckily forgot that though the hands of northerton were tied his legs were at liberty nor did he lay the least injunction on the prisoner that he should not make what use of these he pleased
northerton therefore having given no parole of that kind thought he might without any breach of honour depart not being obliged as he imagined by any rules to wait for a formal discharge
he therefore took up his legs which were at liberty and walked off through the wood which favoured his retreat nor did the woman whose eyes were perhaps rather turned toward her deliverer once think of his escape or give herself any concern or trouble to prevent it
jones therefore at his return found the woman alone
he would have spent some time in searching for northerton but she would not permit him earnestly entreating that he would accompany her to the town whither they had been directed
as to the fellow's escape said she it gives me no uneasiness for philosophy and christianity both preach up forgiveness of injuries
but for you sir i am concerned at the trouble i give you nay indeed my nakedness may well make me ashamed to look you in the face and if it was not for the sake of your protection i should wish to go alone  jones offered her his coat but i know not for what reason she absolutely refused the most earnest solicitations to accept it
he then begged her to forget both the causes of her confusion
with regard to the former says he i have done no more than my duty in protecting you and as for the latter i will entirely remove it by walking before you all the way for i would not have my eyes offend you and i could not answer for my power of resisting the attractive charms of so much beauty  thus our heroe and the redeemed lady walked in the same manner as orpheus and eurydice marched heretofore but though i cannot believe that jones was designedly tempted by his fair one to look behind him yet as she frequently wanted his assistance to help her over stiles and had besides many trips and other accidents he was often obliged to turn about
however he had better fortune than what attended poor orpheus for he brought his companion or rather follower safe into the famous town of upton
chapter iii
the arrival of mr jones with his lady at the inn with a very full description of the battle of upton
though the reader we doubt not is very eager to know who this lady was and how she fell into the hands of mr northerton we must beg him to suspend his curiosity for a short time as we are obliged for some very good reasons which hereafter perhaps he may guess to delay his satisfaction a little longer
mr jones and his fair companion no sooner entered the town than they went directly to that inn which in their eyes presented the fairest appearance to the street
here jones having ordered a servant to show a room above stairs was ascending when the dishevelled fair hastily following was laid hold on by the master of the house who cried heyday where is that beggar wench going
stay below stairs i desire you but jones at that instant thundered from above let the lady come up in so authoritative a voice that the good man instantly withdrew his hands and the lady made the best of her way to the chamber
here jones wished her joy of her safe arrival and then departed in order as he promised to send the landlady up with some cloaths
the poor woman thanked him heartily for all his kindness and said she hoped she should see him again soon to thank him a thousand times more
during this short conversation she covered her white bosom as well as she could possibly with her arms for jones could not avoid stealing a sly peep or two though he took all imaginable care to avoid giving any offence
our travellers had happened to take up their residence at a house of exceeding good repute whither irish ladies of strict virtue and many northern lasses of the same predicament were accustomed to resort in their way to bath
the landlady therefore would by no means have admitted any conversation of a disreputable kind to pass under her roof
indeed so foul and contagious are all such proceedings that they contaminate the very innocent scenes where they are committed and give the name of a bad house or of a house of ill repute to all those where they are suffered to be carried on
not that i would intimate that such strict chastity as was preserved in the temple of vesta can possibly be maintained at a public inn
my good landlady did not hope for such a blessing nor would any of the ladies i have spoken of or indeed any others of the most rigid note have expected or insisted on any such thing
but to exclude all vulgar concubinage and to drive all whores in rags from within the walls is within the power of every one
this my landlady very strictly adhered to and this her virtuous guests who did not travel in rags would very reasonably have expected of her
now it required no very blameable degree of suspicion to imagine that mr jones and his ragged companion had certain purposes in their intention which though tolerated in some christian countries connived at in others and practised in all are however as expressly forbidden as murder or any other horrid vice by that religion which is universally believed in those countries
the landlady therefore had no sooner received an intimation of the entrance of the abovesaid persons than she began to meditate the most expeditious means for their expulsion
in order to this she had provided herself with a long and deadly instrument with which in times of peace the chambermaid was wont to demolish the labours of the industrious spider
in vulgar phrase she had taken up the broomstick and was just about to sally from the kitchen when jones accosted her with a demand of a gown and other vestments to cover the halfnaked woman upstairs
nothing can be more provoking to the human temper nor more dangerous to that cardinal virtue patience than solicitations of extraordinary offices of kindness on behalf of those very persons with whom we are highly incensed
for this reason shakespear hath artfully introduced his desdemona soliciting favours for cassio of her husband as the means of inflaming not only his jealousy but his rage to the highest pitch of madness and we find the unfortunate moor less able to command his passion on this occasion than even when he beheld his valued present to his wife in the hands of his supposed rival
in fact we regard these efforts as insults on our understanding and to such the pride of man is very difficultly brought to submit
my landlady though a very goodtempered woman had i suppose some of this pride in her composition for jones had scarce ended his request when she fell upon him with a certain weapon which though it be neither long nor sharp nor hard nor indeed threatens from its appearance with either death or wound hath been however held in great dread and abhorrence by many wise mennay by many brave ones insomuch that some who have dared to look into the mouth of a loaded cannon have not dared to look into a mouth where this weapon was brandished and rather than run the hazard of its execution have contented themselves with making a most pitiful and sneaking figure in the eyes of all their acquaintance
to confess the truth i am afraid mr jones was one of these for though he was attacked and violently belaboured with the aforesaid weapon he could not be provoked to make any resistance but in a most cowardly manner applied with many entreaties to his antagonist to desist from pursuing her blows in plain english he only begged her with the utmost earnestness to hear him but before he could obtain his request my landlord himself entered into the fray and embraced that side of the cause which seemed to stand very little in need of assistance
there are a sort of heroes who are supposed to be determined in their chusing or avoiding a conflict by the character and behaviour of the person whom they are to engage
these are said to know their men and jones i believe knew his woman for though he had been so submissive to her he was no sooner attacked by her husband than he demonstrated an immediate spirit of resentment and enjoined him silence under a very severe penalty no less than that i think of being converted into fuel for his own fire
the husband with great indignation but with a mixture of pity answered you must pray first to be made able
i believe i am a better man than yourself ay every way that i am and presently proceeded to discharge halfadozen whores at the lady above stairs the last of which had scarce issued from his lips when a swinging blow from the cudgel that jones carried in his hand assaulted him over the shoulders
it is a question whether the landlord or the landlady was the most expeditious in returning this blow
my landlord whose hands were empty fell to with his fist and the good wife uplifting her broom and aiming at the head of jones had probably put an immediate end to the fray and to jones likewise had not the descent of this broom been preventednot by the miraculous intervention of any heathen deity but by a very natural though fortunate accident viz by the arrival of partridge who entered the house at that instant for fear had caused him to run every step from the hill and who seeing the danger which threatened his master or companion which you chuse to call him prevented so sad a catastrophe by catching hold of the landlady's arm as it was brandished aloft in the air
the landlady soon perceived the impediment which prevented her blow and being unable to rescue her arm from the hands of partridge she let fall the broom and then leaving jones to the discipline of her husband she fell with the utmost fury on that poor fellow who had already given some intimation of himself by crying zounds
do you intend to kill my friend  partridge though not much addicted to battle would not however stand still when his friend was attacked nor was he much displeased with that part of the combat which fell to his share he therefore returned my landlady's blows as soon as he received them and now the fight was obstinately maintained on all parts and it seemed doubtful to which side fortune would incline when the naked lady who had listened at the top of the stairs to the dialogue which preceded the engagement descended suddenly from above and without weighing the unfair inequality of two to one fell upon the poor woman who was boxing with partridge nor did that great champion desist but rather redoubled his fury when he found fresh succours were arrived to his assistance
victory must now have fallen to the side of the travellers for the bravest troops must yield to numbers had not susan the chambermaid come luckily to support her mistress
this susan was as twohanded a wench according to the phrase as any in the country and would i believe have beat the famed thalestris herself or any of her subject amazons for her form was robust and manlike and every way made for such encounters
as her hands and arms were formed to give blows with great mischief to an enemy so was her face as well contrived to receive blows without any great injury to herself her nose being already flat to her face her lips were so large that no swelling could be perceived in them and moreover they were so hard that a fist could hardly make any impression on them
lastly her cheekbones stood out as if nature had intended them for two bastions to defend her eyes in those encounters for which she seemed so well calculated and to which she was most wonderfully well inclined
this fair creature entering the field of battle immediately filed to that wing where her mistress maintained so unequal a fight with one of either sex
here she presently challenged partridge to single combat
he accepted the challenge and a most desperate fight began between them
now the dogs of war being let loose began to lick their bloody lips now victory with golden wings hung hovering in the air now fortune taking her scales from her shelf began to weigh the fates of tom jones his female companion and partridge against the landlord his wife and maid all which hung in exact balance before her when a goodnatured accident put suddenly an end to the bloody fray with which half of the combatants had already sufficiently feasted
this accident was the arrival of a coach and four upon which my landlord and landlady immediately desisted from fighting and at their entreaty obtained the same favour of their antagonists but susan was not so kind to partridge for that amazonian fair having overthrown and bestrid her enemy was now cuffing him lustily with both her hands without any regard to his request of a cessation of arms or to those loud exclamations of murder which he roared forth
no sooner however had jones quitted the landlord than he flew to the rescue of his defeated companion from whom he with much difficulty drew off the enraged chambermaid but partridge was not immediately sensible of his deliverance for he still lay flat on the floor guarding his face with his hands nor did he cease roaring till jones had forced him to look up and to perceive that the battle was at an end
the landlord who had no visible hurt and the landlady hiding her wellscratched face with her handkerchief ran both hastily to the door to attend the coach from which a young lady and her maid now alighted
these the landlady presently ushered into that room where mr jones had at first deposited his fair prize as it was the best apartment in the house
hither they were obliged to pass through the field of battle which they did with the utmost haste covering their faces with their handkerchiefs as desirous to avoid the notice of any one
indeed their caution was quite unnecessary for the poor unfortunate helen the fatal cause of all the bloodshed was entirely taken up in endeavouring to conceal her own face and jones was no less occupied in rescuing partridge from the fury of susan which being happily effected the poor fellow immediately departed to the pump to wash his face and to stop that bloody torrent which susan had plentifully set aflowing from his nostrils
chapter iv
in which the arrival of a man of war puts a final end to hostilities and causes the conclusion of a firm and lasting peace between all parties
a serjeant and a file of musqueteers with a deserter in their custody arrived about this time
the serjeant presently enquired for the principal magistrate of the town and was informed by my landlord that he himself was vested in that office
he then demanded his billets together with a mug of beer and complaining it was cold spread himself before the kitchen fire
mr jones was at this time comforting the poor distressed lady who sat down at a table in the kitchen and leaning her head upon her arm was bemoaning her misfortunes but lest my fair readers should be in pain concerning a particular circumstance i think proper here to acquaint them that before she had quitted the room above stairs she had so well covered herself with a pillowbeer which she there found that her regard to decency was not in the least violated by the presence of so many men as were now in the room
one of the soldiers now went up to the serjeant and whispered something in his ear upon which he stedfastly fixed his eyes on the lady and having looked at her for near a minute he came up to her saying i ask pardon madam but i am certain i am not deceived you can be no other person than captain waters's lady  the poor woman who in her present distress had very little regarded the face of any person present no sooner looked at the serjeant than she presently recollected him and calling him by his name answered that she was indeed the unhappy person he imagined her to be but added i wonder any one should know me in this disguise to which the serjeant replied he was very much surprized to see her ladyship in such a dress and was afraid some accident had happened to heran accident hath happened to me indeed says she and i am highly obliged to this gentleman pointing to jones that it was not a fatal one or that i am now living to mention itwhatever the gentleman hath done cries the serjeant i am sure the captain will make him amends for it and if i can be of any service your ladyship may command me and i shall think myself very happy to have it in my power to serve your ladyship and so indeed may any one for i know the captain will well reward them for it  the landlady who heard from the stairs all that past between the serjeant and mrs waters came hastily down and running directly up to her began to ask pardon for the offences she had committed begging that all might be imputed to ignorance of her quality for lud
madam says she how should i have imagined that a lady of your fashion would appear in such a dress
i am sure madam if i had once suspected that your ladyship was your ladyship i would sooner have burnt my tongue out than have said what i have said and i hope your ladyship will accept of a gown till you can get your own cloaths  prithee woman says mrs waters cease your impertinence how can you imagine i should concern myself about anything which comes from the lips of such low creatures as yourself
but i am surprized at your assurance in thinking after what is past that i will condescend to put on any of your dirty things
i would have you know creature i have a spirit above that  here jones interfered and begged mrs waters to forgive the landlady and to accept her gown for i must confess cries he our appearance was a little suspicious when first we came in and i am well assured all this good woman did was as she professed out of regard to the reputation of her house  yes upon my truly was it says she the gentleman speaks very much like a gentleman and i see very plainly is so and to be certain the house is well known to be a house of as good reputation as any on the road and though i say it is frequented by gentry of the best quality both irish and english
i defy anybody to say black is my eye for that matter
and as i was saying if i had known your ladyship to be your ladyship i would as soon have burnt my fingers as have affronted your ladyship but truly where gentry come and spend their money i am not willing that they should be scandalized by a set of poor shabby vermin that wherever they go leave more lice than money behind them such folks never raise my compassion for to be certain it is foolish to have any for them and if our justices did as they ought they would be all whipt out of the kingdom for to be certain it is what is most fitting for them
but as for your ladyship i am heartily sorry your ladyship hath had a misfortune and if your ladyship will do me the honour to wear my cloaths till you can get some of your ladyship's own to be certain the best i have is at your ladyship's service  whether cold shame or the persuasions of mr jones prevailed most on mrs waters i will not determine but she suffered herself to be pacified by this speech of my landlady and retired with that good woman in order to apparel herself in a decent manner
my landlord was likewise beginning his oration to jones but was presently interrupted by that generous youth who shook him heartily by the hand and assured him of entire forgiveness saying if you are satisfied my worthy friend i promise you i am and indeed in one sense the landlord had the better reason to be satisfied for he had received a bellyfull of drubbing whereas jones had scarce felt a single blow
partridge who had been all this time washing his bloody nose at the pump returned into the kitchen at the instant when his master and the landlord were shaking hands with each other
as he was of a peaceable disposition he was pleased with those symptoms of reconciliation and though his face bore some marks of susan's fist and many more of her nails he rather chose to be contented with his fortune in the last battle than to endeavour at bettering it in another
the heroic susan was likewise well contented with her victory though it had cost her a black eye which partridge had given her at the first onset
between these two therefore a league was struck and those hands which had been the instruments of war became now the mediators of peace
matters were thus restored to a perfect calm at which the serjeant though it may seem so contrary to the principles of his profession testified his approbation
why now that's friendly said he dn me i hate to see two people bear illwill to one another after they have had a tussel
the only way when friends quarrel is to see it out fairly in a friendly manner as a man may call it either with a fist or sword or pistol according as they like and then let it be all over for my own part dn me if ever i love my friend better than when i am fighting with him
to bear malice is more like a frenchman than an englishman  he then proposed a libation as a necessary part of the ceremony at all treaties of this kind
perhaps the reader may here conclude that he was well versed in antient history but this though highly probable as he cited no authority to support the custom i will not affirm with any confidence
most likely indeed it is that he founded his opinion on very good authority since he confirmed it with many violent oaths
jones no sooner heard the proposal than immediately agreeing with the learned serjeant he ordered a bowl or rather a large mug filled with the liquor used on these occasions to be brought in and then began the ceremony himself
he placed his right hand in that of the landlord and seizing the bowl with his left uttered the usual words and then made his libation
after which the same was observed by all present
indeed there is very little need of being particular in describing the whole form as it differed so little from those libations of which so much is recorded in antient authors and their modern transcribers
the principal difference lay in two instances for first the present company poured the liquor only down their throats and secondly the serjeant who officiated as priest drank the last but he preserved i believe the antient form in swallowing much the largest draught of the whole company and in being the only person present who contributed nothing towards the libation besides his good offices in assisting at the performance
the good people now ranged themselves round the kitchen fire where good humour seemed to maintain an absolute dominion and partridge not only forgot his shameful defeat but converted hunger into thirst and soon became extremely facetious
we must however quit this agreeable assembly for a while and attend mr jones to mrs waters's apartment where the dinner which he had bespoke was now on the table
indeed it took no long time in preparing having been all drest three days before and required nothing more from the cook than to warm it over again
chapter v  an apology for all heroes who have good stomachs with a description of a battle of the amorous kind
heroes notwithstanding the high ideas which by the means of flatterers they may entertain of themselves or the world may conceive of them have certainly more of mortal than divine about them
however elevated their minds may be their bodies at least which is much the major part of most are liable to the worst infirmities and subject to the vilest offices of human nature
among these latter the act of eating which hath by several wise men been considered as extremely mean and derogatory from the philosophic dignity must be in some measure performed by the greatest prince heroe or philosopher upon earth nay sometimes nature hath been so frolicsome as to exact of these dignified characters a much more exorbitant share of this office than she hath obliged those of the lowest order to perform
to say the truth as no known inhabitant of this globe is really more than man so none need be ashamed of submitting to what the necessities of man demand but when those great personages i have just mentioned condescend to aim at confining such low offices to themselvesas when by hoarding or destroying they seem desirous to prevent any others from eatingthen they surely become very low and despicable
now after this short preface we think it no disparagement to our heroe to mention the immoderate ardour with which he laid about him at this season
indeed it may be doubted whether ulysses who by the way seems to have had the best stomach of all the heroes in that eating poem of the odyssey ever made a better meal
three pounds at least of that flesh which formerly had contributed to the composition of an ox was now honoured with becoming part of the individual mr jones
this particular we thought ourselves obliged to mention as it may account for our heroe's temporary neglect of his fair companion who eat but very little and was indeed employed in considerations of a very different nature which passed unobserved by jones till he had entirely satisfied that appetite which a fast of twentyfour hours had procured him but his dinner was no sooner ended than his attention to other matters revived with these matters therefore we shall now proceed to acquaint the reader
mr jones of whose personal accomplishments we have hitherto said very little was in reality one of the handsomest young fellows in the world
his face besides being the picture of health had in it the most apparent marks of sweetness and goodnature
these qualities were indeed so characteristical in his countenance that while the spirit and sensibility in his eyes though they must have been perceived by an accurate observer might have escaped the notice of the less discerning so strongly was this goodnature painted in his look that it was remarked by almost every one who saw him
it was perhaps as much owing to this as to a very fine complexion that his face had a delicacy in it almost inexpressible and which might have given him an air rather too effeminate had it not been joined to a most masculine person and mien which latter had as much in them of the hercules as the former had of the adonis
he was besides active genteel gay and goodhumoured and had a flow of animal spirits which enlivened every conversation where he was present
when the reader hath duly reflected on these many charms which all centered in our heroe and considers at the same time the fresh obligations which mrs waters had to him it will be a mark more of prudery than candour to entertain a bad opinion of her because she conceived a very good opinion of him
but whatever censures may be passed upon her it is my business to relate matters of fact with veracity
mrs waters had in truth not only a good opinion of our heroe but a very great affection for him
to speak out boldly at once she was in love according to the present universallyreceived sense of that phrase by which love is applied indiscriminately to the desirable objects of all our passions appetites and senses and is understood to be that preference which we give to one kind of food rather than to another
but though the love to these several objects may possibly be one and the same in all cases its operations however must be allowed to be different for how much soever we may be in love with an excellent surloin of beef or bottle of burgundy with a damask rose or cremona fiddle yet do we never smile nor ogle nor dress nor flatter nor endeavour by any other arts or tricks to gain the affection of the said beef c sigh indeed we sometimes may but it is generally in the absence not in the presence of the beloved object
for otherwise we might possibly complain of their ingratitude and deafness with the same reason as pasiphae doth of her bull whom she endeavoured to engage by all the coquetry practised with good success in the drawingroom on the much more sensible as well as tender hearts of the fine gentlemen there
the contrary happens in that love which operates between persons of the same species but of different sexes
here we are no sooner in love than it becomes our principal care to engage the affection of the object beloved
for what other purpose indeed are our youth instructed in all the arts of rendering themselves agreeable
if it was not with a view to this love i question whether any of those trades which deal in setting off and adorning the human person would procure a livelihood
nay those great polishers of our manners who are by some thought to teach what principally distinguishes us from the brute creation even dancingmasters themselves might possibly find no place in society
in short all the graces which young ladies and young gentlemen too learn from others and the many improvements which by the help of a lookingglass they add of their own are in reality those very spicula et faces amoris so often mentioned by ovid or as they are sometimes called in our own language the whole artillery of love
now mrs waters and our heroe had no sooner sat down together than the former began to play this artillery upon the latter
but here as we are about to attempt a description hitherto unassayed either in prose or verse we think proper to invoke the assistance of certain arial beings who will we doubt not come kindly to our aid on this occasion
say then ye graces
you that inhabit the heavenly mansions of seraphina's countenance for you are truly divine are always in her presence and well know all the arts of charming say what were the weapons now used to captivate the heart of mr jones  first from two lovely blue eyes whose bright orbs flashed lightning at their discharge flew forth two pointed ogles but happily for our heroe hit only a vast piece of beef which he was then conveying into his plate and harmless spent their force
the fair warrior perceived their miscarriage and immediately from her fair bosom drew forth a deadly sigh
a sigh which none could have heard unmoved and which was sufficient at once to have swept off a dozen beaus so soft so sweet so tender that the insinuating air must have found its subtle way to the heart of our heroe had it not luckily been driven from his ears by the coarse bubbling of some bottled ale which at that time he was pouring forth
many other weapons did she assay but the god of eating if there be any such deity for i do not confidently assert it preserved his votary or perhaps it may not be dignus vindice nodus and the present security of jones may be accounted for by natural means for as love frequently preserves from the attacks of hunger so may hunger possibly in some cases defend us against love
the fair one enraged at her frequent disappointments determined on a short cessation of arms
which interval she employed in making ready every engine of amorous warfare for the renewing of the attack when dinner should be over
no sooner then was the cloth removed than she again began her operations
first having planted her right eye sidewise against mr jones she shot from its corner a most penetrating glance which though great part of its force was spent before it reached our heroe did not vent itself absolutely without effect
this the fair one perceiving hastily withdrew her eyes and levelled them downwards as if she was concerned for what she had done though by this means she designed only to draw him from his guard and indeed to open his eyes through which she intended to surprize his heart
and now gently lifting up those two bright orbs which had already begun to make an impression on poor jones she discharged a volley of small charms at once from her whole countenance in a smile
not a smile of mirth nor of joy but a smile of affection which most ladies have always ready at their command and which serves them to show at once their goodhumour their pretty dimples and their white teeth
this smile our heroe received full in his eyes and was immediately staggered with its force
he then began to see the designs of the enemy and indeed to feel their success
a parley now was set on foot between the parties during which the artful fair so slily and imperceptibly carried on her attack that she had almost subdued the heart of our heroe before she again repaired to acts of hostility
to confess the truth i am afraid mr jones maintained a kind of dutch defence and treacherously delivered up the garrison without duly weighing his allegiance to the fair sophia
in short no sooner had the amorous parley ended and the lady had unmasked the royal battery by carelessly letting her handkerchief drop from her neck than the heart of mr jones was entirely taken and the fair conqueror enjoyed the usual fruits of her victory  here the graces think proper to end their description and here we think proper to end the chapter
chapter vi
a friendly conversation in the kitchen which had a very common though not very friendly conclusion
while our lovers were entertaining themselves in the manner which is partly described in the foregoing chapter they were likewise furnishing out an entertainment for their good friends in the kitchen
and this in a double sense by affording them matter for their conversation and at the same time drink to enliven their spirits
there were now assembled round the kitchen fire besides my landlord and landlady who occasionally went backward and forward mr partridge the serjeant and the coachman who drove the young lady and her maid
partridge having acquainted the company with what he had learnt from the man of the hill concerning the situation in which mrs waters had been found by jones the serjeant proceeded to that part of her history which was known to him
he said she was the wife of mr waters who was a captain in their regiment and had often been with him at quarters
some folks says he used indeed to doubt whether they were lawfully married in a church or no
but for my part that's no business of mine i must own if i was put to my corporal oath i believe she is little better than one of us and i fancy the captain may go to heaven when the sun shines upon a rainy day
but if he does that is neither here nor there for he won't want company
and the lady to give the devil his due is a very good sort of lady and loves the cloth and is always desirous to do strict justice to it for she hath begged off many a poor soldier and by her goodwill would never have any of them punished
but yet to be sure ensign northerton and she were very well acquainted together at our last quarters that is the very right and truth of the matter
but the captain he knows nothing about it and as long as there is enough for him too what does it signify
he loves her not a bit the worse and i am certain would run any man through the body that was to abuse her therefore i won't abuse her for my part
i only repeat what other folks say and to be certain what everybody says there must be some truth inay ay a great deal of truth i warrant you cries partridge veritas odium paritall a parcel of scandalous stuff answered the mistress of the house
i am sure now she is drest she looks like a very good sort of lady and she behaves herself like one for she gave me a guinea for the use of my cloathsa very good lady indeed cries the landlord and if you had not been a little too hasty you would not have quarrelled with her as you did at firstyou need mention that with my truly  answered she if it had not been for your nonsense nothing had happened
you must be meddling with what did not belong to you and throw in your fool's discoursewell well answered he what's past cannot be mended so there's an end of the matteryes cries she for this once but will it be mended ever the more hereafter
this is not the first time i have suffered for your numscull's pate
i wish you would always hold your tongue in the house and meddle only in matters without doors which concern you
don't you remember what happened about seven years agonay my dear returned he don't rip up old stories
come come all's well and i am sorry for what i have done the landlady was going to reply but was prevented by the peacemaking serjeant sorely to the displeasure of partridge who was a great lover of what is called fun and a great promoter of those harmless quarrels which tend rather to the production of comical than tragical incidents
the serjeant asked partridge whither he and his master were travelling
none of your magisters answered partridge i am no man's servant i assure you for though i have had misfortunes in the world i write gentleman after my name and as poor and simple as i may appear now i have taught grammarschool in my time sed hei mihi
non sum quod fuino offence i hope sir said the serjeant where then if i may venture to be so bold may you and your friend be travellingyou have now denominated us right says partridge
amici sumus and i promise you my friend is one of the greatest gentlemen in the kingdom at which words both landlord and landlady pricked up their ears
he is the heir of squire allworthywhat the squire who doth so much good all over the country cries my landlady
even he answered partridgethen i warrant says she he'll have a swinging great estate hereaftermost certainly  answered partridgewell replied the landlady i thought the first moment i saw him he looked like a good sort of gentleman but my husband here to be sure is wiser than anybodyi own my dear  cries he it was a mistakea mistake indeed answered she but when did you ever know me to make such mistakesbut how comes it sir cries the landlord that such a great gentleman walks about the country afooti don't know returned partridge great gentlemen have humours sometimes
he hath now a dozen horses and servants at gloucester and nothing would serve him but last night it being very hot weather he must cool himself with a walk to yon high hill whither i likewise walked with him to bear him company but if ever you catch me there again for i was never so frightened in all my life
we met with the strangest man therei'll be hanged cries the landlord if it was not the man of the hill as they call him if indeed he be a man but i know several people who believe it is the devil that lives therenay nay like enough says partridge and now you put me in the head of it i verily and sincerely believe it was the devil though i could not perceive his cloven foot but perhaps he might have the power given him to hide that since evil spirits can appear in what shapes they pleaseand pray sir says the serjeant no offence i hope but pray what sort of a gentleman is the devil
for i have heard some of our officers say there is no such person and that it is only a trick of the parsons to prevent their being broke for if it was publickly known that there was no devil the parsons would be of no more use than we are in time of peacethose officers says partridge are very great scholars i supposenot much of schollards neither answered the serjeant they have not half your learning sir i believe and to be sure i thought there must be a devil notwithstanding what they said though one of them was a captain for methought thinks i to myself if there be no devil how can wicked people be sent to him
and i have read all that upon a booksome of your officers quoth the landlord will find there is a devil to their shame i believe
i don't question but he'll pay off some old scores upon my account
here was one quartered upon me half a year who had the conscience to take up one of my best beds though he hardly spent a shilling a day in the house and suffered his men to roast cabbages at the kitchen fire because i would not give them a dinner on a sunday
every good christian must desire there should be a devil for the punishment of such wretchesharkee landlord said the serjeant don't abuse the cloth for i won't take itdn the cloth answered the landlord i have suffered enough by thembear witness gentlemen says the serjeant he curses the king and that's high treasoni curse the king
you villain said the landlord
yes you did cries the serjeant you cursed the cloth and that's cursing the king
it's all one and the same for every man who curses the cloth would curse the king if he durst so for matter o' that it's all one and the same thingexcuse me there mr serjeant quoth partridge that's a non sequiturnone of your outlandish linguo answered the serjeant leaping from his seat i will not sit still and hear the cloth abusedyou mistake me friend cries partridge
i did not mean to abuse the cloth i only said your conclusion was a non sequitur
you are another cries the serjeant an you come to that
no more a sequitur than yourself
you are a pack of rascals and i'll prove it for i will fight the best man of you all for twenty pound this challenge effectually silenced partridge whose stomach for drubbing did not so soon return after the hearty meal which he had lately been treated with but the coachman whose bones were less sore and whose appetite for fighting was somewhat sharper did not so easily brook the affront of which he conceived some part at least fell to his share
he started therefore from his seat and advancing to the serjeant swore he looked on himself to be as good a man as any in the army and offered to box for a guinea
the military man accepted the combat but refused the wager upon which both immediately stript and engaged till the driver of horses was so well mauled by the leader of men that he was obliged to exhaust his small remainder of breath in begging for quarter
 this word which the serjeant unhappily mistook for an affront   is a term in logic and means that the conclusion does not follow   from the premises
the young lady was now desirous to depart and had given orders for her coach to be prepared but all in vain for the coachman was disabled from performing his office for that evening
an antient heathen would perhaps have imputed this disability to the god of drink no less than to the god of war for in reality both the combatants had sacrificed as well to the former deity as to the latter
to speak plainly they were both dead drunk nor was partridge in a much better situation
as for my landlord drinking was his trade and the liquor had no more effect on him than it had on any other vessel in his house
the mistress of the inn being summoned to attend mr jones and his companion at their tea gave a full relation of the latter part of the foregoing scene and at the same time expressed great concern for the young lady who she said was under the utmost uneasiness at being prevented from pursuing her journey
she is a sweet pretty creature  added she and i am certain i have seen her face before
i fancy she is in love and running away from her friends
who knows but some young gentleman or other may be expecting her with a heart as heavy as her own  jones fetched a heavy sigh at those words of which though mrs waters observed it she took no notice while the landlady continued in the room but after the departure of that good woman she could not forbear giving our heroe certain hints on her suspecting some very dangerous rival in his affections
the aukward behaviour of mr jones on this occasion convinced her of the truth without his giving her a direct answer to any of her questions but she was not nice enough in her amours to be greatly concerned at the discovery
the beauty of jones highly charmed her eye but as she could not see his heart she gave herself no concern about it
she could feast heartily at the table of love without reflecting that some other already had been or hereafter might be feasted with the same repast
a sentiment which if it deals but little in refinement deals however much in substance and is less capricious and perhaps less illnatured and selfish than the desires of those females who can be contented enough to abstain from the possession of their lovers provided they are sufficiently satisfied that no one else possesses them
chapter vii
containing a fuller account of mrs waters and by what means she came into that distressful situation from which she was rescued by jones
though nature hath by no means mixed up an equal share either of curiosity or vanity in every human composition there is perhaps no individual to whom she hath not allotted such a proportion of both as requires much arts and pains too to subdue and keep undera conquest however absolutely necessary to every one who would in any degree deserve the characters of wisdom or good breeding
as jones therefore might very justly be called a wellbred man he had stifled all that curiosity which the extraordinary manner in which he had found mrs waters must be supposed to have occasioned
he had indeed at first thrown out some few hints to the lady but when he perceived her industriously avoiding any explanation he was contented to remain in ignorance the rather as he was not without suspicion that there were some circumstances which must have raised her blushes had she related the whole truth
now since it is possible that some of our readers may not so easily acquiesce under the same ignorance and as we are very desirous to satisfy them all we have taken uncommon pains to inform ourselves of the real fact with the relation of which we shall conclude this book
this lady then had lived some years with one captain waters who was a captain in the same regiment to which mr northerton belonged
she past for that gentleman's wife and went by his name and yet as the serjeant said there were some doubts concerning the reality of their marriage which we shall not at present take upon us to resolve
mrs waters i am sorry to say it had for some time contracted an intimacy with the abovementioned ensign which did no great credit to her reputation
that she had a remarkable fondness for that young fellow is most certain but whether she indulged this to any very criminal lengths is not so extremely clear unless we will suppose that women never grant every favour to a man but one without granting him that one also
the division of the regiment to which captain waters belonged had two days preceded the march of that company to which mr northerton was the ensign so that the former had reached worcester the very day after the unfortunate reencounter between jones and northerton which we have before recorded
now it had been agreed between mrs waters and the captain that she would accompany him in his march as far as worcester where they were to take their leave of each other and she was thence to return to bath where she was to stay till the end of the winter's campaign against the rebels
with this agreement mr northerton was made acquainted
to say the truth the lady had made him an assignation at this very place and promised to stay at worcester till his division came thither with what view and for what purpose must be left to the reader's divination for though we are obliged to relate facts we are not obliged to do a violence to our nature by any comments to the disadvantage of the loveliest part of the creation
northerton no sooner obtained a release from his captivity as we have seen than he hasted away to overtake mrs waters which as he was a very active nimble fellow he did at the lastmentioned city some few hours after captain waters had left her
at his first arrival he made no scruple of acquainting her with the unfortunate accident which he made appear very unfortunate indeed for he totally extracted every particle of what could be called fault at least in a court of honour though he left some circumstances which might be questionable in a court of law
women to their glory be it spoken are more generally capable of that violent and apparently disinterested passion of love which seeks only the good of its object than men
mrs waters therefore was no sooner apprized of the danger to which her lover was exposed than she lost every consideration besides that of his safety and this being a matter equally agreeable to the gentleman it became the immediate subject of debate between them
after much consultation on this matter it was at length agreed that the ensign should go across the country to hereford whence he might find some conveyance to one of the seaports in wales and thence might make his escape abroad
in all which expedition mrs waters declared she would bear him company and for which she was able to furnish him with money a very material article to mr northerton she having then in her pocket three banknotes to the amount of  besides some cash and a diamond ring of pretty considerable value on her finger
all which she with the utmost confidence revealed to this wicked man little suspecting she should by these means inspire him with a design of robbing her
now as they must by taking horses from worcester have furnished any pursuers with the means of hereafter discovering their route the ensign proposed and the lady presently agreed to make their first stage on foot for which purpose the hardness of the frost was very seasonable
the main part of the lady's baggage was already at bath and she had nothing with her at present besides a very small quantity of linen which the gallant undertook to carry in his own pockets
all things therefore being settled in the evening they arose early the next morning and at five o'clock departed from worcester it being then above two hours before day but the moon which was then at the full gave them all the light she was capable of affording
mrs waters was not of that delicate race of women who are obliged to the invention of vehicles for the capacity of removing themselves from one place to another and with whom consequently a coach is reckoned among the necessaries of life
her limbs were indeed full of strength and agility and as her mind was no less animated with spirit she was perfectly able to keep pace with her nimble lover
having travelled on for some miles in a high road which northerton said he was informed led to hereford they came at the break of day to the side of a large wood where he suddenly stopped and affecting to meditate a moment with himself expressed some apprehensions from travelling any longer in so public a way
upon which he easily persuaded his fair companion to strike with him into a path which seemed to lead directly through the wood and which at length brought them both to the bottom of mazard hill
whether the execrable scheme which he now attempted to execute was the effect of previous deliberation or whether it now first came into his head i cannot determine
but being arrived in this lonely place where it was very improbable he should meet with any interruption he suddenly slipped his garter from his leg and laying violent hands on the poor woman endeavoured to perpetrate that dreadful and detestable fact which we have before commemorated and which the providential appearance of jones did so fortunately prevent
happy was it for mrs waters that she was not of the weakest order of females for no sooner did she perceive by his tying a knot in his garter and by his declarations what his hellish intentions were than she stood stoutly to her defence and so strongly struggled with her enemy screaming all the while for assistance that she delayed the execution of the villain's purpose several minutes by which means mr jones came to her relief at that very instant when her strength failed and she was totally overpowered and delivered her from the ruffian's hands with no other loss than that of her cloaths which were torn from her back and of the diamond ring which during the contention either dropped from her finger or was wrenched from it by northerton
thus reader we have given thee the fruits of a very painful enquiry which for thy satisfaction we have made into this matter
and here we have opened to thee a scene of folly as well as villany which we could scarce have believed a human creature capable of being guilty of had we not remembered that this fellow was at that time firmly persuaded that he had already committed a murder and had forfeited his life to the law
as he concluded therefore that his only safety lay in flight he thought the possessing himself of this poor woman's money and ring would make him amends for the additional burthen he was to lay on his conscience
and here reader we must strictly caution thee that thou dost not take any occasion from the misbehaviour of such a wretch as this to reflect on so worthy and honourable a body of men as are the officers of our army in general
thou wilt be pleased to consider that this fellow as we have already informed thee had neither the birth nor education of a gentleman nor was a proper person to be enrolled among the number of such
if therefore his baseness can justly reflect on any besides himself it must be only on those who gave him his commission
book x
in which the history goes forward about twelve hours
chapter i
containing instructions very necessary to be perused by modern critics
reader it is impossible we should know what sort of person thou wilt be for perhaps thou may'st be as learned in human nature as shakespear himself was and perhaps thou may'st be no wiser than some of his editors
now lest this latter should be the case we think proper before we go any farther together to give thee a few wholesome admonitions that thou may'st not as grossly misunderstand and misrepresent us as some of the said editors have misunderstood and misrepresented their author
first then we warn thee not too hastily to condemn any of the incidents in this our history as impertinent and foreign to our main design because thou dost not immediately conceive in what manner such incident may conduce to that design
this work may indeed be considered as a great creation of our own and for a little reptile of a critic to presume to find fault with any of its parts without knowing the manner in which the whole is connected and before he comes to the final catastrophe is a most presumptuous absurdity
the allusion and metaphor we have here made use of we must acknowledge to be infinitely too great for our occasion but there is indeed no other which is at all adequate to express the difference between an author of the first rate and a critic of the lowest
another caution we would give thee my good reptile is that thou dost not find out too near a resemblance between certain characters here introduced as for instance between the landlady who appears in the seventh book and her in the ninth
thou art to know friend that there are certain characteristics in which most individuals of every profession and occupation agree
to be able to preserve these characteristics and at the same time to diversify their operations is one talent of a good writer
again to mark the nice distinction between two persons actuated by the same vice or folly is another and as this last talent is found in very few writers so is the true discernment of it found in as few readers though i believe the observation of this forms a very principal pleasure in those who are capable of the discovery every person for instance can distinguish between sir epicure mammon and sir fopling flutter but to note the difference between sir fopling flutter and sir courtly nice requires a more exquisite judgment for want of which vulgar spectators of plays very often do great injustice in the theatre where i have sometimes known a poet in danger of being convicted as a thief upon much worse evidence than the resemblance of hands hath been held to be in the law
in reality i apprehend every amorous widow on the stage would run the hazard of being condemned as a servile imitation of dido but that happily very few of our playhouse critics understand enough of latin to read virgil
in the next place we must admonish thee my worthy friend for perhaps thy heart may be better than thy head not to condemn a character as a bad one because it is not perfectly a good one
if thou dost delight in these models of perfection there are books enow written to gratify thy taste but as we have not in the course of our conversation ever happened to meet with any such person we have not chosen to introduce any such here
to say the truth i a little question whether mere man ever arrived at this consummate degree of excellence as well as whether there hath ever existed a monster bad enough to verify that        nulla virtute redemptum        a vitiis     whose vices are not allayed with a single virtue  in juvenal nor do i indeed conceive the good purposes served by inserting characters of such angelic perfection or such diabolical depravity in any work of invention since from contemplating either the mind of man is more likely to be overwhelmed with sorrow and shame than to draw any good uses from such patterns for in the former instance he may be both concerned and ashamed to see a pattern of excellence in his nature which he may reasonably despair of ever arriving at and in contemplating the latter he may be no less affected with those uneasy sensations at seeing the nature of which he is a partaker degraded into so odious and detestable a creature
in fact if there be enough of goodness in a character to engage the admiration and affection of a welldisposed mind though there should appear some of those little blemishes quas humana parum cavit natura they will raise our compassion rather than our abhorrence
indeed nothing can be of more moral use than the imperfections which are seen in examples of this kind since such form a kind of surprize more apt to affect and dwell upon our minds than the faults of very vicious and wicked persons
the foibles and vices of men in whom there is great mixture of good become more glaring objects from the virtues which contrast them and shew their deformity and when we find such vices attended with their evil consequence to our favourite characters we are not only taught to shun them for our own sake but to hate them for the mischiefs they have already brought on those we love
and now my friend having given you these few admonitions we will if you please once more set forward with our history
chapter ii
containing the arrival of an irish gentleman with very extraordinary adventures which ensued at the inn
now the little trembling hare which the dread of all her numerous enemies and chiefly of that cunning cruel carnivorous animal man had confined all the day to her lurkingplace sports wantonly o'er the lawns now on some hollow tree the owl shrill chorister of the night hoots forth notes which might charm the ears of some modern connoisseurs in music now in the imagination of the halfdrunk clown as he staggers through the churchyard or rather charnelyard to his home fear paints the bloody hobgoblin now thieves and ruffians are awake and honest watchmen fast asleep in plain english it was now midnight and the company at the inn as well those who have been already mentioned in this history as some others who arrived in the evening were all in bed
only susan chambermaid was now stirring she being obliged to wash the kitchen before she retired to the arms of the fond expecting hostler
in this posture were affairs at the inn when a gentleman arrived there post
he immediately alighted from his horse and coming up to susan enquired of her in a very abrupt and confused manner being almost out of breath with eagerness whether there was any lady in the house
the hour of night and the behaviour of the man who stared very wildly all the time a little surprized susan so that she hesitated before she made any answer upon which the gentleman with redoubled eagerness begged her to give him a true information saying he had lost his wife and was come in pursuit of her
upon my shoul cries he i have been near catching her already in two or three places if i had not found her gone just as i came up with her
if she be in the house do carry me up in the dark and show her to me and if she be gone away before me do tell me which way i shall go after her to meet her and upon my shoul i will make you the richest poor woman in the nation he then pulled out a handful of guineas a sight which would have bribed persons of much greater consequence than this poor wench to much worse purposes
susan from the account she had received of mrs waters made not the least doubt but that she was the very identical stray whom the right owner pursued
as she concluded therefore with great appearance of reason that she never could get money in an honester way than by restoring a wife to her husband she made no scruple of assuring the gentleman that the lady he wanted was then in the house and was presently afterwards prevailed upon by very liberal promises and some earnest paid into her hands to conduct him to the bedchamber of mrs waters
it hath been a custom long established in the polite world and that upon very solid and substantial reasons that a husband shall never enter his wife's apartment without first knocking at the door
the many excellent uses of this custom need scarce be hinted to a reader who hath any knowledge of the world for by this means the lady hath time to adjust herself or to remove any disagreeable object out of the way for there are some situations in which nice and delicate women would not be discovered by their husbands
to say the truth there are several ceremonies instituted among the polished part of mankind which though they may to coarser judgments appear as matters of mere form are found to have much of substance in them by the more discerning and lucky would it have been had the custom above mentioned been observed by our gentleman in the present instance
knock indeed he did at the door but not with one of those gentle raps which is usual on such occasions
on the contrary when he found the door locked he flew at it with such violence that the lock immediately gave way the door burst open and he fell headlong into the room
he had no sooner recovered his legs than forth from the bed upon his legs likewise appearedwith shame and sorrow are we obliged to proceedour heroe himself who with a menacing voice demanded of the gentleman who he was and what he meant by daring to burst open his chamber in that outrageous manner
the gentleman at first thought he had committed a mistake and was going to ask pardon and retreat when on a sudden as the moon shone very bright he cast his eyes on stays gowns petticoats caps ribbons stockings garters shoes clogs c all which lay in a disordered manner on the floor
all these operating on the natural jealousy of his temper so enraged him that he lost all power of speech and without returning any answer to jones he endeavoured to approach the bed
jones immediately interposing a fierce contention arose which soon proceeded to blows on both sides
and now mrs waters for we must confess she was in the same bed being i suppose awakened from her sleep and seeing two men fighting in her bedchamber began to scream in the most violent manner crying out murder
robbery
and more frequently rape
which last some perhaps may wonder she should mention who do not consider that these words of exclamation are used by ladies in a fright as fa la la ra da c are in music only as the vehicles of sound and without any fixed ideas
next to the lady's chamber was deposited the body of an irish gentleman who arrived too late at the inn to have been mentioned before
this gentleman was one of those whom the irish call a calabalaro or cavalier
he was a younger brother of a good family and having no fortune at home was obliged to look abroad in order to get one for which purpose he was proceeding to the bath to try his luck with cards and the women
this young fellow lay in bed reading one of mrs behn's novels for he had been instructed by a friend that he would find no more effectual method of recommending himself to the ladies than the improving his understanding and filling his mind with good literature
he no sooner therefore heard the violent uproar in the next room than he leapt from his bolster and taking his sword in one hand and the candle which burnt by him in the other he went directly to mrs waters's chamber
if the sight of another man in his shirt at first added some shock to the decency of the lady it made her presently amends by considerably abating her fears for no sooner had the calabalaro entered the room than he cried out mr fitzpatrick what the devil is the maning of this upon which the other immediately answered o mr maclachlan
i am rejoiced you are herethis villain hath debauched my wife and is got into bed with herwhat wife cries maclachlan do not i know mrs fitzpatrick very well and don't i see that the lady whom the gentleman who stands here in his shirt is lying in bed with is none of her  fitzpatrick now perceiving as well by the glimpse he had of the lady as by her voice which might have been distinguished at a greater distance than he now stood from her that he had made a very unfortunate mistake began to ask many pardons of the lady and then turning to jones he said i would have you take notice i do not ask your pardon for you have bate me for which i am resolved to have your blood in the morning  jones treated this menace with much contempt and mr maclachlan answered indeed mr fitzpatrick you may be ashamed of your own self to disturb people at this time of night if all the people in the inn were not asleep you would have awakened them as you have me
the gentleman has served you very rightly
upon my conscience though i have no wife if you had treated her so i would have cut your throat  jones was so confounded with his fears for his lady's reputation that he knew neither what to say or do but the invention of women is as hath been observed much readier than that of men
she recollected that there was a communication between her chamber and that of mr jones relying therefore on his honour and her own assurance she answered i know not what you mean villains
i am wife to none of you
help
rape
murder
rapeand now the landlady coming into the room mrs waters fell upon her with the utmost virulence saying she thought herself in a sober inn and not in a bawdyhouse but that a set of villains had broke into her room with an intent upon her honour if not upon her life and both she said were equally dear to her  the landlady now began to roar as loudly as the poor woman in bed had done before
she cried she was undone and that the reputation of her house which was never blown upon before was utterly destroyed  then turning to the men she cried what in the devil's name is the reason of all this disturbance in the lady's room fitzpatrick hanging down his head repeated that he had committed a mistake for which he heartily asked pardon and then retired with his countryman
jones who was too ingenious to have missed the hint given him by his fair one boldly asserted that he had run to her assistance upon hearing the door broke open with what design he could not conceive unless of robbing the lady which if they intended he said he had the good fortune to prevent i never had a robbery committed in my house since i have kept it cries the landlady i would have you to know sir i harbour no highwaymen here i scorn the word thof i say it
none but honest good gentlefolks are welcome to my house and i thank good luck i have always had enow of such customers indeed as many as i could entertain
here hath been my lord and then she repeated over a catalogue of names and titles many of which we might perhaps be guilty of a breach of privilege by inserting
jones after much patience at length interrupted her by making an apology to mrs waters for having appeared before her in his shirt assuring her that nothing but a concern for her safety could have prevailed on him to do it the reader may inform himself of her answer and indeed of her whole behaviour to the end of the scene by considering the situation which she affected it being that of a modest lady who was awakened out of her sleep by three strange men in her chamber
this was the part which she undertook to perform and indeed she executed it so well that none of our theatrical actresses could exceed her in any of their performances either on or off the stage
and hence i think we may very fairly draw an argument to prove how extremely natural virtue is to the fair sex for though there is not perhaps one in ten thousand who is capable of making a good actress and even among these we rarely see two who are equally able to personate the same character yet this of virtue they can all admirably well put on and as well those individuals who have it not as those who possess it can all act it to the utmost degree of perfection
when the men were all departed mrs waters recovering from her fear recovered likewise from her anger and spoke in much gentler accents to the landlady who did not so readily quit her concern for the reputation of the house in favour of which she began again to number the many great persons who had slept under her roof but the lady stopt her short and having absolutely acquitted her of having had any share in the past disturbance begged to be left to her repose which she said she hoped to enjoy unmolested during the remainder of the night
upon which the landlady after much civility and many courtsies took her leave
chapter iii
a dialogue between the landlady and susan the chambermaid proper to be read by all innkeepers and their servants with the arrival and affable behaviour of a beautiful young lady which may teach persons of condition how they may acquire the love of the whole world
the landlady remembering that susan had been the only person out of bed when the door was burst open resorted presently to her to enquire into the first occasion of the disturbance as well as who the strange gentleman was and when and how he arrived
susan related the whole story which the reader knows already varying the truth only in some circumstances as she saw convenient and totally concealing the money which she had received
but whereas her mistress had in the preface to her enquiry spoken much in compassion for the fright which the lady had been in concerning any intended depredations on her virtue susan could not help endeavouring to quiet the concern which her mistress seemed to be under on that account by swearing heartily she saw jones leap out from her bed
the landlady fell into a violent rage at these words
a likely story truly cried she that a woman should cry out and endeavour to expose herself if that was the case
i desire to know what better proof any lady can give of her virtue than her crying out which i believe twenty people can witness for her she did
i beg madam you would spread no such scandal of any of my guests for it will not only reflect on them but upon the house and i am sure no vagabonds nor wicked beggarly people come here  well says susan then i must not believe my own eyes no indeed must you not always answered her mistress i would not have believed my own eyes against such good gentlefolks
i have not had a better supper ordered this halfyear than they ordered last night and so easy and goodhumoured were they that they found no fault with my worcestershire perry which i sold them for champagne and to be sure it is as well tasted and as wholesome as the best champagne in the kingdom otherwise i would scorn to give it 'em and they drank me two bottles
no no i will never believe any harm of such sober good sort of people  susan being thus silenced her mistress proceeded to other matters
and so you tell me continued she that the strange gentleman came post and there is a footman without with the horses why then he is certainly some of your great gentlefolks too
why did not you ask him whether he'd have any supper
i think he is in the other gentleman's room go up and ask whether he called
perhaps he'll order something when he finds anybody stirring in the house to dress it
now don't commit any of your usual blunders by telling him the fire's out and the fowls alive
and if he should order mutton don't blab out that we have none
the butcher i know killed a sheep just before i went to bed and he never refuses to cut it up warm when i desire it
go remember there's all sorts of mutton and fowls go open the door with gentlemen d'ye call
and if they say nothing ask what his honour will be pleased to have for supper
don't forget his honour
go if you don't mind all these matters better you'll never come to anything  susan departed and soon returned with an account that the two gentlemen were got both into the same bed
two gentlemen says the landlady in the same bed
that's impossible they are two arrant scrubs i warrant them and i believe young squire allworthy guessed right that the fellow intended to rob her ladyship for if he had broke open the lady's door with any of the wicked designs of a gentleman he would never have sneaked away to another room to save the expense of a supper and a bed to himself
they are certainly thieves and their searching after a wife is nothing but a pretence  in these censures my landlady did mr fitzpatrick great injustice for he was really born a gentleman though not worth a groat and though perhaps he had some few blemishes in his heart as well as in his head yet being a sneaking or a niggardly fellow was not one of them
in reality he was so generous a man that whereas he had received a very handsome fortune with his wife he had now spent every penny of it except some little pittance which was settled upon her and in order to possess himself of this he had used her with such cruelty that together with his jealousy which was of the bitterest kind it had forced the poor woman to run away from him
this gentleman then being well tired with his long journey from chester in one day with which and some good dry blows he had received in the scuffle his bones were so sore that added to the soreness of his mind it had quite deprived him of any appetite for eating
and being now so violently disappointed in the woman whom at the maid's instance he had mistaken for his wife it never once entered into his head that she might nevertheless be in the house though he had erred in the first person he had attacked
he therefore yielded to the dissuasions of his friend from searching any farther after her that night and accepted the kind offer of part of his bed
the footman and postboy were in a different disposition
they were more ready to order than the landlady was to provide however after being pretty well satisfied by them of the real truth of the case and that mr fitzpatrick was no thief she was at length prevailed on to set some cold meat before them which they were devouring with great greediness when partridge came into the kitchen
he had been first awaked by the hurry which we have before seen and while he was endeavouring to compose himself again on his pillow a screechowl had given him such a serenade at his window that he leapt in a most horrible affright from his bed and huddling on his cloaths with great expedition ran down to the protection of the company whom he heard talking below in the kitchen
his arrival detained my landlady from returning to her rest for she was just about to leave the other two guests to the care of susan but the friend of young squire allworthy was not to be so neglected especially as he called for a pint of wine to be mulled
she immediately obeyed by putting the same quantity of perry to the fire for this readily answered to the name of every kind of wine
the irish footman was retired to bed and the postboy was going to follow but partridge invited him to stay and partake of his wine which the lad very thankfully accepted
the schoolmaster was indeed afraid to return to bed by himself and as he did not know how soon he might lose the company of my landlady he was resolved to secure that of the boy in whose presence he apprehended no danger from the devil or any of his adherents
and now arrived another postboy at the gate upon which susan being ordered out returned introducing two young women in riding habits one of which was so very richly laced that partridge and the postboy instantly started from their chairs and my landlady fell to her courtsies and her ladyships with great eagerness
the lady in the rich habit said with a smile of great condescension if you will give me leave madam i will warm myself a few minutes at your kitchen fire for it is really very cold but i must insist on disturbing no one from his seat this was spoken on account of partridge who had retreated to the other end of the room struck with the utmost awe and astonishment at the splendor of the lady's dress
indeed she had a much better title to respect than this for she was one of the most beautiful creatures in the world
the lady earnestly desired partridge to return to his seat but could not prevail
she then pulled off her gloves and displayed to the fire two hands which had every property of snow in them except that of melting
her companion who was indeed her maid likewise pulled off her gloves and discovered what bore an exact resemblance in cold and colour to a piece of frozen beef
i wish madam quoth the latter your ladyship would not think of going any farther tonight
i am terribly afraid your ladyship will not be able to bear the fatigue  why sure cries the landlady her ladyship's honour can never intend it
o bless me
farther tonight indeed
let me beseech your ladyship not to think on'tbut to be sure your ladyship can't
what will your honour be pleased to have for supper
i have mutton of all kinds and some nice chicken  i think madam said the lady it would be rather breakfast than supper but i can't eat anything and if i stay shall only lie down for an hour or two
however if you please madam you may get me a little sack whey made very small and thin  yes madam cries the mistress of the house i have some excellent white wineyou have no sack then says the lady
yes an't please your honour i have i may challenge the country for thatbut let me beg your ladyship to eat something  upon my word i can't eat a morsel answered the lady and i shall be much obliged to you if you will please to get my apartment ready as soon as possible for i am resolved to be on horseback again in three hours  why susan cries the landlady is there a fire lit yet in the wildgoose
i am sorry madam all my best rooms are full
several people of the first quality are now in bed
here's a great young squire and many other great gentlefolks of quality susan answered that the irish gentlemen were got into the wildgoose  was ever anything like it says the mistress why the devil would you not keep some of the best rooms for the quality when you know scarce a day passes without some calling hereif they be gentlemen i am certain when they know it is for her ladyship they will get up again  not upon my account says the lady i will have no person disturbed for me
if you have a room that is commonly decent it will serve me very well though it be never so plain
i beg madam you will not give yourself so much trouble on my account o madam cries the other i have several very good rooms for that matter but none good enough for your honour's ladyship
however as you are so condescending to take up with the best i have do susan get a fire in the rose this minute
will your ladyship be pleased to go up now or stay till the fire is lighted i think i have sufficiently warmed myself answered the lady so if you please i will go now i am afraid i have kept people and particularly that gentleman meaning partridge too long in the cold already
indeed i cannot bear to think of keeping any person from the fire this dreadful weathershe then departed with her maid the landlady marching with two lighted candles before her
when that good woman returned the conversation in the kitchen was all upon the charms of the young lady
there is indeed in perfect beauty a power which none almost can withstand for my landlady though she was not pleased at the negative given to the supper declared she had never seen so lovely a creature
partridge ran out into the most extravagant encomiums on her face though he could not refrain from paying some compliments to the gold lace on her habit the postboy sung forth the praises of her goodness which were likewise echoed by the other postboy who was now come in
she's a true good lady i warrant her says he for she hath mercy upon dumb creatures for she asked me every now and tan upon the journey if i did not think she should hurt the horses by riding too fast
and when she came in she charged me to give them as much corn as ever they would eat  such charms are there in affability and so sure is it to attract the praises of all kinds of people
it may indeed be compared to the celebrated mrs hussey
 it is equally sure to set off every female perfection to the highest advantage and to palliate and conceal every defect
a short reflection which we could not forbear making in this place where my reader hath seen the loveliness of an affable deportment and truth will now oblige us to contrast it by showing the reverse
 a celebrated mantuamaker in the strand famous for setting off   the shapes of women
chapter iv
containing infallible nostrums for procuring universal disesteem and hatred
the lady had no sooner laid herself on her pillow than the waitingwoman returned to the kitchen to regale with some of those dainties which her mistress had refused
the company at her entrance shewed her the same respect which they had before paid to her mistress by rising but she forgot to imitate her by desiring them to sit down again
indeed it was scarce possible they should have done so for she placed her chair in such a posture as to occupy almost the whole fire
she then ordered a chicken to be broiled that instant declaring if it was not ready in a quarter of an hour she would not stay for it
now though the said chicken was then at roost in the stable and required the several ceremonies of catching killing and picking before it was brought to the gridiron my landlady would nevertheless have undertaken to do all within the time but the guest being unfortunately admitted behind the scenes must have been witness to the fourberie the poor woman was therefore obliged to confess that she had none in the house but madam said she i can get any kind of mutton in an instant from the butcher's  do you think then answered the waitinggentlewoman that i have the stomach of a horse to eat mutton at this time of night
sure you people that keep inns imagine your betters are like yourselves
indeed i expected to get nothing at this wretched place
i wonder my lady would stop at it
i suppose none but tradesmen and grasiers ever call here the landlady fired at this indignity offered to her house however she suppressed her temper and contented herself with saying very good quality frequented it she thanked heaven don't tell me cries the other of quality
i believe i know more of people of quality than such as youbut prithee without troubling me with any of your impertinence do tell me what i can have for supper for though i cannot eat horseflesh i am really hungry why truly madam answered the landlady you could not take me again at such a disadvantage for i must confess i have nothing in the house unless a cold piece of beef which indeed a gentleman's footman and the postboy have almost cleared to the bone woman said mrs abigail so for shortness we will call her i entreat you not to make me sick
if i had fasted a month i could not eat what had been touched by the fingers of such fellows
is there nothing neat or decent to be had in this horrid place what think you of some eggs and bacon madam said the landlady
are your eggs new laid
are you certain they were laid today
and let me have the bacon cut very nice and thin for i can't endure anything that's grossprithee try if you can do a little tolerably for once and don't think you have a farmer's wife or some of those creatures in the housethe landlady began then to handle her knife but the other stopt her saying good woman i must insist upon your first washing your hands for i am extremely nice and have been always used from my cradle to have everything in the most elegant manner  the landlady who governed herself with much difficulty began now the necessary preparations for as to susan she was utterly rejected and with such disdain that the poor wench was as hard put to it to restrain her hands from violence as her mistress had been to hold her tongue
this indeed susan did not entirely for though she literally kept it within her teeth yet there it muttered many marrycomeups as good flesh and blood as yourself with other such indignant phrases
while the supper was preparing mrs abigail began to lament she had not ordered a fire in the parlour but she said that was now too late
however said she i have novelty to recommend a kitchen for i do not believe i ever eat in one before then turning to the postboys she asked them why they were not in the stable with their horses
if i must eat my hard fare here madam cries she to the landlady i beg the kitchen may be kept clear that i may not be surrounded with all the blackguards in town as for you sir says she to partridge you look somewhat like a gentleman and may sit still if you please i don't desire to disturb anybody but mob  yes yes madam cries partridge i am a gentleman i do assure you and i am not so easily to be disturbed
non semper vox casualis est verbo nominativus this latin she took to be some affront and answered you may be a gentleman sir but you don't show yourself as one to talk latin to a woman partridge made a gentle reply and concluded with more latin upon which she tossed up her nose and contented herself by abusing him with the name of a great scholar
the supper being now on the table mrs abigail eat very heartily for so delicate a person and while a second course of the same was by her order preparing she said and so madam you tell me your house is frequented by people of great quality  the landlady answered in the affirmative saying there were a great many very good quality and gentlefolks in it now
there's young squire allworthy as that gentleman there knows  and pray who is this young gentleman of quality this young squire allworthy said abigail
who should he be answered partridge but the son and heir of the great squire allworthy of somersetshire  upon my word said she you tell me strange news for i know mr allworthy of somersetshire very well and i know he hath no son alive  the landlady pricked up her ears at this and partridge looked a little confounded
however after a short hesitation he answered indeed madam it is true everybody doth not know him to be squire allworthy's son for he was never married to his mother but his son he certainly is and will be his heir too as certainly as his name is jones at that word abigail let drop the bacon which she was conveying to her mouth and cried out you surprize me sir
is it possible mr jones should be now in the house quare non answered partridge it is possible and it is certain  abigail now made haste to finish the remainder of her meal and then repaired back to her mistress when the conversation passed which may be read in the next chapter
chapter v  showing who the amiable lady and her unamiable maid were
as in the month of june the damask rose which chance hath planted among the lilies with their candid hue mixes his vermilion or as some playsome heifer in the pleasant month of may diffuses her odoriferous breath over the flowery meadows or as in the blooming month of april the gentle constant dove perched on some fair bough sits meditating on her mate so looking a hundred charms and breathing as many sweets her thoughts being fixed on her tommy with a heart as good and innocent as her face was beautiful sophia for it was she herself lay reclining her lovely head on her hand when her maid entered the room and running directly to the bed cried madammadamwho doth your ladyship think is in the house sophia starting up cried i hope my father hath not overtaken us no madam it is one worth a hundred fathers mr jones himself is here at this very instant mr jones says sophia it is impossible
i cannot be so fortunate her maid averred the fact and was presently detached by her mistress to order him to be called for she said she was resolved to see him immediately
mrs honour had no sooner left the kitchen in the manner we have before seen than the landlady fell severely upon her
the poor woman had indeed been loading her heart with foul language for some time and now it scoured out of her mouth as filth doth from a mudcart when the board which confines it is removed
partridge likewise shovelled in his share of calumny and what may surprize the reader not only bespattered the maid but attempted to sully the lilywhite character of sophia herself
never a barrel the better herring cries he noscitur a socio is a true saying
it must be confessed indeed that the lady in the fine garments is the civiller of the two but i warrant neither of them are a bit better than they should be
a couple of bath trulls i'll answer for them your quality don't ride about at this time o' night without servants sbodlikins and that's true  cries the landlady you have certainly hit upon the very matter for quality don't come into a house without bespeaking a supper whether they eat or no  while they were thus discoursing mrs honour returned and discharged her commission by bidding the landlady immediately wake mr jones and tell him a lady wanted to speak with him
the landlady referred her to partridge saying he was the squire's friend but for her part she never called menfolks especially gentlemen and then walked sullenly out of the kitchen
honour applied herself to partridge but he refused for my friend cries he went to bed very late and he would be very angry to be disturbed so soon mrs honour insisted still to have him called saying she was sure instead of being angry that he would be to the highest degree delighted when he knew the occasion another time perhaps he might cries partridge but non omnia possumus omnes
one woman is enough at once for a reasonable man what do you mean by one woman fellow cries honour
none of your fellow answered partridge
he then proceeded to inform her plainly that jones was in bed with a wench and made use of an expression too indelicate to be here inserted which so enraged mrs honour that she called him jackanapes and returned in a violent hurry to her mistress whom she acquainted with the success of her errand and with the account she had received which if possible she exaggerated being as angry with jones as if he had pronounced all the words that came from the mouth of partridge
she discharged a torrent of abuse on the master and advised her mistress to quit all thoughts of a man who had never shown himself deserving of her
she then ripped up the story of molly seagrim and gave the most malicious turn to his formerly quitting sophia herself which i must confess the present incident not a little countenanced
the spirits of sophia were too much dissipated by concern to enable her to stop the torrent of her maid
at last however she interrupted her saying i never can believe this some villain hath belied him
you say you had it from his friend but surely it is not the office of a friend to betray such secrets i suppose cries honour the fellow is his pimp for i never saw so illlooked a villain
besides such profligate rakes as mr jones are never ashamed of these matters  to say the truth this behaviour of partridge was a little inexcusable but he had not slept off the effect of the dose which he swallowed the evening before which had in the morning received the addition of above a pint of wine or indeed rather of malt spirits for the perry was by no means pure
now that part of his head which nature designed for the reservoir of drink being very shallow a small quantity of liquor overflowed it and opened the sluices of his heart so that all the secrets there deposited run out
these sluices were indeed naturally very illsecured
to give the bestnatured turn we can to his disposition he was a very honest man for as he was the most inquisitive of mortals and eternally prying into the secrets of others so he very faithfully paid them by communicating in return everything within his knowledge
while sophia tormented with anxiety knew not what to believe nor what resolution to take susan arrived with the sackwhey
mrs honour immediately advised her mistress in a whisper to pump this wench who probably could inform her of the truth
sophia approved it and began as follows come hither child now answer me truly what i am going to ask you and i promise you i will very well reward you
is there a young gentleman in this house a handsome young gentleman that here sophia blushed and was confounded
a young gentleman cries honour that came hither in company with that saucy rascal who is now in the kitchen susan answered there wasdo you know anything of any lady continues sophia any lady
i don't ask you whether she is handsome or no perhaps she is not that's nothing to the purpose but do you know of any lady la madam  cries honour you will make a very bad examiner
hark'ee child  says she is not that very young gentleman now in bed with some nasty trull or other here susan smiled and was silent
answer the question child says sophia and here's a guinea for youa guinea
madam cries susan la what's a guinea
if my mistress should know it i shall certainly lose my place that very instant  here's another for you says sophia and i promise you faithfully your mistress shall never know it susan after a very short hesitation took the money and told the whole story concluding with saying if you have any great curiosity madam i can steal softly into his room and see whether he be in his own bed or no she accordingly did this by sophia's desire and returned with an answer in the negative
sophia now trembled and turned pale
mrs honour begged her to be comforted and not to think any more of so worthless a fellow
why there says susan i hope madam your ladyship won't be offended but pray madam is not your ladyship's name madam sophia western  how is it possible you should know me answered sophia
why that man that the gentlewoman spoke of who is in the kitchen told about you last night
but i hope your ladyship is not angry with me  indeed child said she i am not pray tell me all and i promise you i'll reward you why madam continued susan that man told us all in the kitchen that madam sophia westernindeed i don't know how to bring it outhere she stopt till having received encouragement from sophia and being vehemently pressed by mrs honour she proceeded thushe told us madam though to be sure it is all a lie that your ladyship was dying for love of the young squire and that he was going to the wars to get rid of you
i thought to myself then he was a falsehearted wretch but now to see such a fine rich beautiful lady as you be forsaken for such an ordinary woman for to be sure so she is and another man's wife into the bargain
it is such a strange unnatural thing in a manner  sophia gave her a third guinea and telling her she would certainly be her friend if she mentioned nothing of what had passed nor informed any one who she was dismissed the girl with orders to the postboy to get the horses ready immediately
being now left alone with her maid she told her trusty waitingwoman that she never was more easy than at present
i am now convinced  said she he is not only a villain but a low despicable wretch
i can forgive all rather than his exposing my name in so barbarous a manner
that renders him the object of my contempt
yes honour i am now easy i am indeed i am very easy and then she burst into a violent flood of tears
after a short interval spent by sophia chiefly in crying and assuring her maid that she was perfectly easy susan arrived with an account that the horses were ready when a very extraordinary thought suggested itself to our young heroine by which mr jones would be acquainted with her having been at the inn in a way which if any sparks of affection for her remained in him would be at least some punishment for his faults
the reader will be pleased to remember a little muff which hath had the honour of being more than once remembered already in this history
this muff ever since the departure of mr jones had been the constant companion of sophia by day and her bedfellow by night and this muff she had at this very instant upon her arm whence she took it off with great indignation and having writ her name with her pencil upon a piece of paper which she pinned to it she bribed the maid to convey it into the empty bed of mr jones in which if he did not find it she charged her to take some method of conveying it before his eyes in the morning
then having paid for what mrs honour had eaten in which bill was included an account for what she herself might have eaten she mounted her horse and once more assuring her companion that she was perfectly easy continued her journey
chapter vi
containing among other things the ingenuity of partridge the madness of jones and the folly of fitzpatrick
it was now past five in the morning and other company began to rise and come to the kitchen among whom were the serjeant and the coachman who being thoroughly reconciled made a libation or in the english phrase drank a hearty cup together
in this drinking nothing more remarkable happened than the behaviour of partridge who when the serjeant drank a health to king george repeated only the word king nor could he be brought to utter more for though he was going to fight against his own cause yet he could not be prevailed upon to drink against it
mr jones being now returned to his own bed but from whence he returned we must beg to be excused from relating summoned partridge from this agreeable company who after a ceremonious preface having obtained leave to offer his advice delivered himself as follows  it is sir an old saying and a true one that a wise man may sometimes learn counsel from a fool i wish therefore i might be so bold as to offer you my advice which is to return home again and leave these horrida bella these bloody wars to fellows who are contented to swallow gunpowder because they have nothing else to eat
now everybody knows your honour wants for nothing at home when that's the case why should any man travel abroad  partridge cries jones thou art certainly a coward i wish therefore thou wouldst return home thyself and trouble me no more  i ask your honour's pardon cries partridge i spoke on your account more than my own for as to me heaven knows my circumstances are bad enough and i am so far from being afraid that i value a pistol or a blunderbuss or any such thing no more than a popgun
every man must die once and what signifies the manner how
besides perhaps i may come off with the loss only of an arm or a leg
i assure you sir i was never less afraid in my life and so if your honour is resolved to go on i am resolved to follow you
but in that case i wish i might give my opinion
to be sure it is a scandalous way of travelling for a great gentleman like you to walk afoot
now here are two or three good horses in the stable which the landlord will certainly make no scruple of trusting you with but if he should i can easily contrive to take them and let the worst come to the worst the king would certainly pardon you as you are going to fight in his cause  now as the honesty of partridge was equal to his understanding and both dealt only in small matters he would never have attempted a roguery of this kind had he not imagined it altogether safe for he was one of those who have more consideration of the gallows than of the fitness of things but in reality he thought he might have committed this felony without any danger for besides that he doubted not but the name of mr allworthy would sufficiently quiet the landlord he conceived they should be altogether safe whatever turn affairs might take as jones he imagined would have friends enough on one side and as his friends would as well secure him on the other
when mr jones found that partridge was in earnest in this proposal he very severely rebuked him and that in such bitter terms that the other attempted to laugh it off and presently turned the discourse to other matters saying he believed they were then in a bawdy house and that he had with much ado prevented two wenches from disturbing his honour in the middle of the night
heyday says he i believe they got into your chamber whether i would or no for here lies the muff of one of them on the ground indeed as jones returned to his bed in the dark he had never perceived the muff on the quilt and in leaping into his bed he had tumbled it on the floor
this partridge now took up and was going to put into his pocket when jones desired to see it
the muff was so very remarkable that our heroe might possibly have recollected it without the information annexed
but his memory was not put to that hard office for at the same instant he saw and read the words sophia western upon the paper which was pinned to it
his looks now grew frantic in a moment and he eagerly cried out oh heavens
how came this muff here i know no more than your honour cried partridge but i saw it upon the arm of one of the women who would have disturbed you if i would have suffered them  where are they cries jones jumping out of bed and laying hold of his cloaths
many miles off i believe by this time said partridge
and now jones upon further enquiry was sufficiently assured that the bearer of this muff was no other than the lovely sophia herself
the behaviour of jones on this occasion his thoughts his looks his words his actions were such as beggar all description
after many bitter execrations on partridge and not fewer on himself he ordered the poor fellow who was frightened out of his wits to run down and hire him horses at any rate and a very few minutes afterwards having shuffled on his clothes he hastened downstairs to execute the orders himself which he had just before given
but before we proceed to what passed on his arrival in the kitchen it will be necessary to recur to what had there happened since partridge had first left it on his master's summons
the serjeant was just marched off with his party when the two irish gentlemen arose and came downstairs both complaining that they had been so often waked by the noises in the inn that they had never once been able to close their eyes all night
the coach which had brought the young lady and her maid and which perhaps the reader may have hitherto concluded was her own was indeed a returned coach belonging to mr king of bath one of the worthiest and honestest men that ever dealt in horseflesh and whose coaches we heartily recommend to all our readers who travel that road
by which means they may perhaps have the pleasure of riding in the very coach and being driven by the very coachman that is recorded in this history
the coachman having but two passengers and hearing mr maclachlan was going to bath offered to carry him thither at a very moderate price
he was induced to this by the report of the hostler who said that the horse which mr maclachlan had hired from worcester would be much more pleased with returning to his friends there than to prosecute a long journey for that the said horse was rather a twolegged than a fourlegged animal
mr maclachlan immediately closed with the proposal of the coachman and at the same time persuaded his friend fitzpatrick to accept of the fourth place in the coach
this conveyance the soreness of his bones made more agreeable to him than a horse and being well assured of meeting with his wife at bath he thought a little delay would be of no consequence
maclachlan who was much the sharper man of the two no sooner heard that this lady came from chester with the other circumstances which he learned from the hostler than it came into his head that she might possibly be his friend's wife and presently acquainted him with this suspicion which had never once occurred to fitzpatrick himself
to say the truth he was one of those compositions which nature makes up in too great a hurry and forgets to put any brains into their head
now it happens to this sort of men as to bad hounds who never hit off a fault themselves but no sooner doth a dog of sagacity open his mouth than they immediately do the same and without the guidance of any scent run directly forwards as fast as they are able
in the same manner the very moment mr maclachlan had mentioned his apprehension mr fitzpatrick instantly concurred and flew directly upstairs to surprize his wife before he knew where she was and unluckily as fortune loves to play tricks with those gentlemen who put themselves entirely under her conduct ran his head against several doors and posts to no purpose
much kinder was she to me when she suggested that simile of the hounds just before inserted since the poor wife may on these occasions be so justly compared to a hunted hare
like that little wretched animal she pricks up her ears to listen after the voice of her pursuer like her flies away trembling when she hears it and like her is generally overtaken and destroyed in the end
this was not however the case at present for after a long fruitless search mr fitzpatrick returned to the kitchen where as if this had been a real chace entered a gentleman hallowing as hunters do when the hounds are at a fault
he was just alighted from his horse and had many attendants at his heels
here reader it may be necessary to acquaint thee with some matters which if thou dost know already thou art wiser than i take thee to be
and this information thou shalt receive in the next chapter
chapter vii
in which are concluded the adventures that happened at the inn at upton
in the first place then this gentleman just arrived was no other person than squire western himself who was come hither in pursuit of his daughter and had he fortunately been two hours earlier he had not only found her but his niece into the bargain for such was the wife of mr fitzpatrick who had run away with her five years before out of the custody of that sage lady madam western
now this lady had departed from the inn much about the same time with sophia for having been waked by the voice of her husband she had sent up for the landlady and being by her apprized of the matter had bribed the good woman at an extravagant price to furnish her with horses for her escape
such prevalence had money in this family and though the mistress would have turned away her maid for a corrupt hussy if she had known as much as the reader yet she was no more proof against corruption herself than poor susan had been
mr western and his nephew were not known to one another nor indeed would the former have taken any notice of the latter if he had known him for this being a stolen match and consequently an unnatural one in the opinion of the good squire he had from the time of her committing it abandoned the poor young creature who was then no more than eighteen as a monster and had never since suffered her to be named in his presence
the kitchen was now a scene of universal confusion western enquiring after his daughter and fitzpatrick as eagerly after his wife when jones entered the room unfortunately having sophia's muff in his hand
as soon as western saw jones he set up the same holla as is used by sportsmen when their game is in view
he then immediately run up and laid hold of jones crying we have got the dog fox i warrant the bitch is not far off the jargon which followed for some minutes where many spoke different things at the same time as it would be very difficult to describe so would it be no less unpleasant to read
jones having at length shaken mr western off and some of the company having interfered between them our heroe protested his innocence as to knowing anything of the lady when parson supple stepped up and said it is folly to deny it for why the marks of guilt are in thy hands
i will myself asseverate and bind it by an oath that the muff thou bearest in thy hand belongeth unto madam sophia for i have frequently observed her of later days to bear it about her my daughter's muff cries the squire in a rage
hath he got my daughter's muff
bear witness the goods are found upon him
i'll have him before a justice of peace this instant
where is my daughter villain sir said jones i beg you would be pacified
the muff i acknowledge is the young lady's but upon my honour i have never seen her at these words western lost all patience and grew inarticulate with rage
some of the servants had acquainted fitzpatrick who mr western was
the good irishman therefore thinking he had now an opportunity to do an act of service to his uncle and by that means might possibly obtain his favour stept up to jones and cried out upon my conscience sir you may be ashamed of denying your having seen the gentleman's daughter before my face when you know i found you there upon the bed together then turning to western he offered to conduct him immediately to the room where his daughter was which offer being accepted he the squire the parson and some others ascended directly to mrs waters's chamber which they entered with no less violence than mr fitzpatrick had done before
the poor lady started from her sleep with as much amazement as terror and beheld at her bedside a figure which might very well be supposed to have escaped out of bedlam
such wildness and confusion were in the looks of mr western who no sooner saw the lady than he started back shewing sufficiently by his manner before he spoke that this was not the person sought after
so much more tenderly do women value their reputation than their persons that though the latter seemed now in more danger than before yet as the former was secure the lady screamed not with such violence as she had done on the other occasion
however she no sooner found herself alone than she abandoned all thoughts of further repose and as she had sufficient reason to be dissatisfied with her present lodging she dressed herself with all possible expedition
mr western now proceeded to search the whole house but to as little purpose as he had disturbed poor mrs waters
he then returned disconsolate into the kitchen where he found jones in the custody of his servants
this violent uproar had raised all the people in the house though it was yet scarcely daylight
among these was a grave gentleman who had the honour to be in the commission of the peace for the county of worcester
of which mr western was no sooner informed than he offered to lay his complaint before him
the justice declined executing his office as he said he had no clerk present nor no book about justice business and that he could not carry all the law in his head about stealing away daughters and such sort of things
here mr fitzpatrick offered to lend him his assistance informing the company that he had been himself bred to the law
and indeed he had served three years as clerk to an attorney in the north of ireland when chusing a genteeler walk in life he quitted his master came over to england and set up that business which requires no apprenticeship namely that of a gentleman in which he had succeeded as hath been already partly mentioned
mr fitzpatrick declared that the law concerning daughters was out of the present case that stealing a muff was undoubtedly felony and the goods being found upon the person were sufficient evidence of the fact
the magistrate upon the encouragement of so learned a coadjutor and upon the violent intercession of the squire was at length prevailed upon to seat himself in the chair of justice where being placed upon viewing the muff which jones still held in his hand and upon the parson's swearing it to be the property of mr western he desired mr fitzpatrick to draw up a commitment which he said he would sign
jones now desired to be heard which was at last with difficulty granted him
he then produced the evidence of mr partridge as to the finding it but what was still more susan deposed that sophia herself had delivered the muff to her and had ordered her to convey it into the chamber where mr jones had found it
whether a natural love of justice or the extraordinary comeliness of jones had wrought on susan to make the discovery i will not determine but such were the effects of her evidence that the magistrate throwing himself back in his chair declared that the matter was now altogether as clear on the side of the prisoner as it had before been against him with which the parson concurred saying the lord forbid he should be instrumental in committing an innocent person to durance
the justice then arose acquitted the prisoner and broke up the court
mr western now gave every one present a hearty curse and immediately ordering his horses departed in pursuit of his daughter without taking the least notice of his nephew fitzpatrick or returning any answer to his claim of kindred notwithstanding all the obligations he had just received from that gentleman
in the violence moreover of his hurry and of his passion he luckily forgot to demand the muff of jones i say luckily for he would have died on the spot rather than have parted with it
jones likewise with his friend partridge set forward the moment he had paid his reckoning in quest of his lovely sophia whom he now resolved never more to abandon the pursuit of
nor could he bring himself even to take leave of mrs waters of whom he detested the very thoughts as she had been though not designedly the occasion of his missing the happiest interview with sophia to whom he now vowed eternal constancy
as for mrs waters she took the opportunity of the coach which was going to bath for which place she set out in company with the two irish gentlemen the landlady kindly lending her her cloaths in return for which she was contented only to receive about double their value as a recompence for the loan
upon the road she was perfectly reconciled to mr fitzpatrick who was a very handsome fellow and indeed did all she could to console him in the absence of his wife
thus ended the many odd adventures which mr jones encountered at his inn at upton where they talk to this day of the beauty and lovely behaviour of the charming sophia by the name of the somersetshire angel
chapter viii
in which the history goes backward
before we proceed any farther in our history it may be proper to look a little back in order to account for the extraordinary appearance of sophia and her father at the inn at upton
the reader may be pleased to remember that in the ninth chapter of the seventh book of our history we left sophia after a long debate between love and duty deciding the cause as it usually i believe happens in favour of the former
this debate had arisen as we have there shown from a visit which her father had just before made her in order to force her consent to a marriage with blifil and which he had understood to be fully implied in her acknowledgment that she neither must nor could refuse any absolute command of his  now from this visit the squire retired to his evening potation overjoyed at the success he had gained with his daughter and as he was of a social disposition and willing to have partakers in his happiness the beer was ordered to flow very liberally into the kitchen so that before eleven in the evening there was not a single person sober in the house except only mrs western herself and the charming sophia
early in the morning a messenger was despatched to summon mr blifil for though the squire imagined that young gentleman had been much less acquainted than he really was with the former aversion of his daughter as he had not however yet received her consent he longed impatiently to communicate it to him not doubting but that the intended bride herself would confirm it with her lips
as to the wedding it had the evening before been fixed by the male parties to be celebrated on the next morning save one
breakfast was now set forth in the parlour where mr blifil attended and where the squire and his sister likewise were assembled and now sophia was ordered to be called
o shakespear
had i thy pen
o hogarth
had i thy pencil
then would i draw the picture of the poor servingman who with pale countenance staring eyes chattering teeth faultering tongue and trembling limbs       e'en such a man so faint so spiritless      so dull so dead in look so woebegone      drew priam's curtains in the dead of night      and would have told him half his troy was burn'd  entered the room and declaredthat madam sophia was not to be found
not to be found cries the squire starting from his chair zounds and dnation
blood and fury
where when how whatnot to be found
where  la
brother said mrs western with true political coldness you are always throwing yourself into such violent passions for nothing
my niece i suppose is only walked out into the garden
i protest you are grown so unreasonable that it is impossible to live in the house with you  nay nay answered the squire returning as suddenly to himself as he had gone from himself if that be all the matter it signifies not much but upon my soul my mind misgave me when the fellow said she was not to be found he then gave orders for the bell to be rung in the garden and sat himself contentedly down
no two things could be more the reverse of each other than were the brother and sister in most instances particularly in this that as the brother never foresaw anything at a distance but was most sagacious in immediately seeing everything the moment it had happened so the sister eternally foresaw at a distance but was not so quicksighted to objects before her eyes
of both these the reader may have observed examples and indeed both their several talents were excessive for as the sister often foresaw what never came to pass so the brother often saw much more than was actually the truth
this was not however the case at present
the same report was brought from the garden as before had been brought from the chamber that madam sophia was not to be found
the squire himself now sallied forth and began to roar forth the name of sophia as loudly and in as hoarse a voice as whilome did hercules that of hylas and as the poet tells us that the whole shore echoed back the name of that beautiful youth so did the house the garden and all the neighbouring fields resound nothing but the name of sophia in the hoarse voices of the men and in the shrill pipes of the women while echo seemed so pleased to repeat the beloved sound that if there is really such a person i believe ovid hath belied her sex
nothing reigned for a long time but confusion till at last the squire having sufficiently spent his breath returned to the parlour where he found mrs western and mr blifil and threw himself with the utmost dejection in his countenance into a great chair
here mrs western began to apply the following consolation  brother i am sorry for what hath happened and that my niece should have behaved herself in a manner so unbecoming her family but it is all your own doings and you have nobody to thank but yourself
you know she hath been educated always in a manner directly contrary to my advice and now you see the consequence
have i not a thousand times argued with you about giving my niece her own will
but you know i never could prevail upon you and when i had taken so much pains to eradicate her headstrong opinions and to rectify your errors in policy you know she was taken out of my hands so that i have nothing to answer for
had i been trusted entirely with the care of her education no such accident as this had ever befallen you so that you must comfort yourself by thinking it was all your own doing and indeed what else could be expected from such indulgence  zounds
sister answered he you are enough to make one mad
have i indulged her
have i given her her willit was no longer ago than last night that i threatened if she disobeyed me to confine her to her chamber upon bread and water as long as she livedyou would provoke the patience of job  did ever mortal hear the like replied she
brother if i had not the patience of fifty jobs you would make me forget all decency and decorum
why would you interfere
did i not beg you did i not intreat you to leave the whole conduct to me
you have defeated all the operations of the campaign by one false step
would any man in his senses have provoked a daughter by such threats as these
how often have i told you that english women are not to be treated like ciracessian slaves
we have the protection of the world we are to be won by gentle means only and not to be hectored and bullied and beat into compliance
i thank heaven no salique law governs here
brother you have a roughness in your manner which no woman but myself would bear
i do not wonder my niece was frightened and terrified into taking this measure and to speak honestly i think my niece will be justified to the world for what she hath done
i repeat it to you again brother you must comfort yourself by rememb'ring that it is all your own fault
how often have i advised here western rose hastily from his chair and venting two or three horrid imprecations ran out of the room
 possibly circassian
when he was departed his sister expressed more bitterness if possible against him than she had done while he was present for the truth of which she appealed to mr blifil who with great complacence acquiesced entirely in all she said but excused all the faults of mr western as they must be considered he said to have proceeded from the too inordinate fondness of a father which must be allowed the name of an amiable weakness so much the more inexcuseable  answered the lady for whom doth he ruin by his fondness but his own child to which blifil immediately agreed
mrs western then began to express great confusion on the account of mr blifil and of the usage which he had received from a family to which he intended so much honour
on this subject she treated the folly of her niece with great severity but concluded with throwing the whole on her brother who she said was inexcuseable to have proceeded so far without better assurances of his daughter's consent but he was says she always of a violent headstrong temper and i can scarce forgive myself for all the advice i have thrown away upon him  after much of this kind of conversation which perhaps would not greatly entertain the reader was it here particularly related mr blifil took his leave and returned home not highly pleased with his disappointment which however the philosophy which he had acquired from square and the religion infused into him by thwackum together with somewhat else taught him to bear rather better than more passionate lovers bear these kinds of evils
chapter ix
the escape of sophia
it is now time to look after sophia whom the reader if he loves her half so well as i do will rejoice to find escaped from the clutches of her passionate father and from those of her dispassionate lover
twelve times did the iron register of time beat on the sonorous bellmetal summoning the ghosts to rise and walk their nightly roundin plainer language it was twelve o'clock and all the family as we have said lay buried in drink and sleep except only mrs western who was deeply engaged in reading a political pamphlet and except our heroine who now softly stole downstairs and having unbarred and unlocked one of the housedoors sallied forth and hastened to the place of appointment
notwithstanding the many pretty arts which ladies sometimes practise to display their fears on every little occasion almost as many as the other sex uses to conceal theirs certainly there is a degree of courage which not only becomes a woman but is often necessary to enable her to discharge her duty
it is indeed the idea of fierceness and not of bravery which destroys the female character for who can read the story of the justly celebrated arria without conceiving as high an opinion of her gentleness and tenderness as of her fortitude
at the same time perhaps many a woman who shrieks at a mouse or a rat may be capable of poisoning a husband or what is worse of driving him to poison himself
sophia with all the gentleness which a woman can have had all the spirit which she ought to have
when therefore she came to the place of appointment and instead of meeting her maid as was agreed saw a man ride directly up to her she neither screamed out nor fainted away not that her pulse then beat with its usual regularity for she was at first under some surprize and apprehension but these were relieved almost as soon as raised when the man pulling off his hat asked her in a very submissive manner if her ladyship did not expect to meet another lady and then proceeded to inform her that he was sent to conduct her to that lady
sophia could have no possible suspicion of any falsehood in this account she therefore mounted resolutely behind the fellow who conveyed her safe to a town about five miles distant where she had the satisfaction of finding the good mrs honour for as the soul of the waitingwoman was wrapt up in those very habiliments which used to enwrap her body she could by no means bring herself to trust them out of her sight
upon these therefore she kept guard in person while she detached the aforesaid fellow after her mistress having given him all proper instructions
they now debated what course to take in order to avoid the pursuit of mr western who they knew would send after them in a few hours
the london road had such charms for honour that she was desirous of going on directly alleging that as sophia could not be missed till eight or nine the next morning her pursuers would not be able to overtake her even though they knew which way she had gone
but sophia had too much at stake to venture anything to chance nor did she dare trust too much to her tender limbs in a contest which was to be decided only by swiftness
she resolved therefore to travel across the country for at least twenty or thirty miles and then to take the direct road to london
so having hired horses to go twenty miles one way when she intended to go twenty miles the other she set forward with the same guide behind whom she had ridden from her father's house the guide having now taken up behind him in the room of sophia a much heavier as well as much less lovely burden being indeed a huge portmanteau well stuffed with those outside ornaments by means of which the fair honour hoped to gain many conquests and finally to make her fortune in london city
when they had gone about two hundred paces from the inn on the london road sophia rode up to the guide and with a voice much fuller of honey than was ever that of plato though his mouth is supposed to have been a beehive begged him to take the first turning which led towards bristol
reader i am not superstitious nor any great believer of modern miracles
i do not therefore deliver the following as a certain truth for indeed i can scarce credit it myself but the fidelity of an historian obliges me to relate what hath been confidently asserted
the horse then on which the guide rode is reported to have been so charmed by sophia's voice that he made a full stop and expressed an unwillingness to proceed any farther
perhaps however the fact may be true and less miraculous than it hath been represented since the natural cause seems adequate to the effect for as the guide at that moment desisted from a constant application of his armed right heel for like hudibras he wore but one spur it is more than possible that this omission alone might occasion the beast to stop especially as this was very frequent with him at other times
but if the voice of sophia had really an effect on the horse it had very little on the rider
he answered somewhat surlily that measter had ordered him to go a different way and that he should lose his place if he went any other than that he was ordered  sophia finding all her persuasions had no effect began now to add irresistible charms to her voice charms which according to the proverb makes the old mare trot instead of standing still charms
to which modern ages have attributed all that irresistible force which the antients imputed to perfect oratory
in a word she promised she would reward him to his utmost expectation
the lad was not totally deaf to these promises but he disliked their being indefinite for though perhaps he had never heard that word yet that in fact was his objection
he said gentlevolks did not consider the case of poor volks that he had like to have been turned away the other day for riding about the country with a gentleman from squire allworthy's who did not reward him as he should have done  with whom says sophia eagerly
with a gentleman from squire allworthy's repeated the lad the squire's son i think they call 'unwhither
which way did he go says sophiawhy a little o' one side o' bristol about twenty miles off answered the ladguide me says sophia to the same place and i'll give thee a guinea or two if one is not sufficientto be certain said the boy it is honestly worth two when your ladyship considers what a risk i run but however if your ladyship will promise me the two guineas i'll e'en venture to be certain it is a sinful thing to ride about my measter's horses but one comfort is i can only be turned away and two guineas will partly make me amends  the bargain being thus struck the lad turned aside into the bristol road and sophia set forward in pursuit of jones highly contrary to the remonstrances of mrs honour who had much more desire to see london than to see mr jones for indeed she was not his friend with her mistress as he had been guilty of some neglect in certain pecuniary civilities which are by custom due to the waitinggentlewoman in all love affairs and more especially in those of a clandestine kind
this we impute rather to the carelessness of his temper than to any want of generosity but perhaps she derived it from the latter motive
certain it is that she hated him very bitterly on that account and resolved to take every opportunity of injuring him with her mistress
it was therefore highly unlucky for her that she had gone to the very same town and inn whence jones had started and still more unlucky was she in having stumbled on the same guide and on this accidental discovery which sophia had made
our travellers arrived at hambrook at the break of day where honour was against her will charged to enquire the route which mr jones had taken
of this indeed the guide himself could have informed them but sophia i know not for what reason never asked him the question
 this was the village where jones met the quaker
when mrs honour had made her report from the landlord sophia with much difficulty procured some indifferent horses which brought her to the inn where jones had been confined rather by the misfortune of meeting with a surgeon than by having met with a broken head
here honour being again charged with a commission of enquiry had no sooner applied herself to the landlady and had described the person of mr jones than that sagacious woman began in the vulgar phrase to smell a rat
when sophia therefore entered the room instead of answering the maid the landlady addressing herself to the mistress began the following speech good lackaday
why there now who would have thought it
i protest the loveliest couple that ever eye beheld
ifackins madam it is no wonder the squire run on so about your ladyship
he told me indeed you was the finest lady in the world and to be sure so you be
mercy on him poor heart
i bepitied him so i did when he used to hug his pillow and call it his dear madam sophia
i did all i could to dissuade him from going to the wars i told him there were men enow that were good for nothing else but to be killed that had not the love of such fine ladies sure says sophia the good woman is distracted no no cries the landlady i am not distracted
what doth your ladyship think i don't know then
i assure you he told me all what saucy fellow cries honour told you anything of my lady no saucy fellow answered the landlady but the young gentleman you enquired after and a very pretty young gentleman he is and he loves madam sophia western to the bottom of his soul he love my lady
i'd have you to know woman she is meat for his masternay honour said sophia interrupting her don't be angry with the good woman she intends no harm no marry don't i answered the landlady emboldened by the soft accents of sophia and then launched into a long narrative too tedious to be here set down in which some passages dropt that gave a little offence to sophia and much more to her waitingwoman who hence took occasion to abuse poor jones to her mistress the moment they were alone together saying that he must be a very pitiful fellow and could have no love for a lady whose name he would thus prostitute in an alehouse  sophia did not see his behaviour in so very disadvantageous a light and was perhaps more pleased with the violent raptures of his love which the landlady exaggerated as much as she had done every other circumstance than she was offended with the rest and indeed she imputed the whole to the extravagance or rather ebullience of his passion and to the openness of his heart
this incident however being afterwards revived in her mind and placed in the most odious colours by honour served to heighten and give credit to those unlucky occurrences at upton and assisted the waitingwoman in her endeavours to make her mistress depart from that inn without seeing jones
the landlady finding sophia intended to stay no longer than till her horses were ready and that without either eating or drinking soon withdrew when honour began to take her mistress to task for indeed she used great freedom and after a long harangue in which she reminded her of her intention to go to london and gave frequent hints of the impropriety of pursuing a young fellow she at last concluded with this serious exhortation for heaven's sake madam consider what you are about and whither you are going  this advice to a lady who had already rode near forty miles and in no very agreeable season may seem foolish enough
it may be supposed she had well considered and resolved this already nay mrs honour by the hints she threw out seemed to think so and this i doubt not is the opinion of many readers who have i make no doubt been long since well convinced of the purpose of our heroine and have heartily condemned her for it as a wanton baggage
but in reality this was not the case
sophia had been lately so distracted between hope and fear her duty and love to her father her hatred to blifil her compassion and why should we not confess the truth
her love for jones which last the behaviour of her father of her aunt of every one else and more particularly of jones himself had blown into a flame that her mind was in that confused state which may be truly said to make us ignorant of what we do or whither we go or rather indeed indifferent as to the consequence of either
the prudent and sage advice of her maid produced however some cool reflection and she at length determined to go to gloucester and thence to proceed directly to london
but unluckily a few miles before she entered that town she met the hackattorney who as is before mentioned had dined there with mr jones
this fellow being well known to mrs honour stopt and spoke to her of which sophia at that time took little notice more than to enquire who he was
but having had a more particular account from honour of this man afterwards at gloucester and hearing of the great expedition he usually made in travelling for which as hath been before observed he was particularly famous recollecting likewise that she had overheard mrs honour inform him that they were going to gloucester she began to fear lest her father might by this fellow's means be able to trace her to that city wherefore if she should there strike into the london road she apprehended he would certainly be able to overtake her
she therefore altered her resolution and having hired horses to go a week's journey a way which she did not intend to travel she again set forward after a light refreshment contrary to the desire and earnest entreaties of her maid and to the no less vehement remonstrances of mrs whitefield who from good breeding or perhaps from good nature for the poor young lady appeared much fatigued pressed her very heartily to stay that evening at gloucester
having refreshed herself only with some tea and with lying about two hours on the bed while her horses were getting ready she resolutely left mrs whitefield's about eleven at night and striking directly into the worcester road within less than four hours arrived at that very inn where we last saw her
having thus traced our heroine very particularly back from her departure till her arrival at upton we shall in a very few words bring her father to the same place who having received the first scent from the postboy who conducted his daughter to hambrook very easily traced her afterwards to gloucester whence he pursued her to upton as he had learned mr jones had taken that route for partridge to use the squire's expression left everywhere a strong scent behind him and he doubted not in the least but sophia travelled or as he phrased it ran the same way
he used indeed a very coarse expression which need not be here inserted as foxhunters who alone will understand it will easily suggest it to themselves

chapter i
a crust for the critics
in our last initial chapter we may be supposed to have treated that formidable set of men who are called critics with more freedom than becomes us since they exact and indeed generally receive great condescension from authors
we shall in this therefore give the reasons of our conduct to this august body and here we shall perhaps place them in a light in which they have not hitherto been seen
this word critic is of greek derivation and signifies judgment
hence i presume some persons who have not understood the original and have seen the english translation of the primitive have concluded that it meant judgment in the legal sense in which it is frequently used as equivalent to condemnation
i am the rather inclined to be of that opinion as the greatest number of critics hath of late years been found amongst the lawyers
many of these gentlemen from despair perhaps of ever rising to the bench in westminsterhall have placed themselves on the benches at the playhouse where they have exerted their judicial capacity and have given judgment ie condemned without mercy
the gentlemen would perhaps be well enough pleased if we were to leave them thus compared to one of the most important and honourable offices in the commonwealth and if we intended to apply to their favour we would do so but as we design to deal very sincerely and plainly too with them we must remind them of another officer of justice of a much lower rank to whom as they not only pronounce but execute their own judgment they bear likewise some remote resemblance
but in reality there is another light in which these modern critics may with great justice and propriety be seen and this is that of a common slanderer
if a person who prys into the characters of others with no other design but to discover their faults and to publish them to the world deserves the title of a slanderer of the reputations of men why should not a critic who reads with the same malevolent view be as properly stiled the slanderer of the reputation of books
vice hath not i believe a more abject slave society produces not a more odious vermin nor can the devil receive a guest more worthy of him nor possibly more welcome to him than a slanderer
the world i am afraid regards not this monster with half the abhorrence which he deserves and i am more afraid to assign the reason of this criminal lenity shown towards him yet it is certain that the thief looks innocent in the comparison nay the murderer himself can seldom stand in competition with his guilt for slander is a more cruel weapon than a sword as the wounds which the former gives are always incurable
one method indeed there is of killing and that the basest and most execrable of all which bears an exact analogy to the vice here disclaimed against and that is poison a means of revenge so base and yet so horrible that it was once wisely distinguished by our laws from all other murders in the peculiar severity of the punishment
besides the dreadful mischiefs done by slander and the baseness of the means by which they are effected there are other circumstances that highly aggravate its atrocious quality for it often proceeds from no provocation and seldom promises itself any reward unless some black and infernal mind may propose a reward in the thoughts of having procured the ruin and misery of another
shakespear hath nobly touched this vice when he says   who steals my purse steals trash 't is something nothing   'twas mine 'tis his and hath been slave to thousands   but he that filches from me my good name   robs me of that which not enriches him   but makes me poor indeed  with all this my good reader will doubtless agree but much of it will probably seem too severe when applied to the slanderer of books
but let it here be considered that both proceed from the same wicked disposition of mind and are alike void of the excuse of temptation
nor shall we conclude the injury done this way to be very slight when we consider a book as the author's offspring and indeed as the child of his brain
the reader who hath suffered his muse to continue hitherto in a virgin state can have but a very inadequate idea of this kind of paternal fondness
to such we may parody the tender exclamation of macduff alas
thou hast written no book but the author whose muse hath brought forth will feel the pathetic strain perhaps will accompany me with tears especially if his darling be already no more while i mention the uneasiness with which the big muse bears about her burden the painful labour with which she produces it and lastly the care the fondness with which the tender father nourishes his favourite till it be brought to maturity and produced into the world
nor is there any paternal fondness which seems less to savour of absolute instinct and which may so well be reconciled to worldly wisdom as this
these children may most truly be called the riches of their father and many of them have with true filial piety fed their parent in his old age so that not only the affection but the interest of the author may be highly injured by these slanderers whose poisonous breath brings his book to an untimely end
lastly the slander of a book is in truth the slander of the author for as no one can call another bastard without calling the mother a whore so neither can any one give the names of sad stuff horrid nonsense c to a book without calling the author a blockhead which though in a moral sense it is a preferable appellation to that of villain is perhaps rather more injurious to his worldly interest
now however ludicrous all this may appear to some others i doubt not will feel and acknowledge the truth of it nay may perhaps think i have not treated the subject with decent solemnity but surely a man may speak truth with a smiling countenance
in reality to depreciate a book maliciously or even wantonly is at least a very illnatured office and a morose snarling critic may i believe be suspected to be a bad man
i will therefore endeavour in the remaining part of this chapter to explain the marks of this character and to show what criticism i here intend to obviate for i can never be understood unless by the very persons here meant to insinuate that there are no proper judges of writing or to endeavour to exclude from the commonwealth of literature any of those noble critics to whose labours the learned world are so greatly indebted
such were aristotle horace and longinus among the antients dacier and bossu among the french and some perhaps among us who have certainly been duly authorised to execute at least a judicial authority in foro literario
but without ascertaining all the proper qualifications of a critic which i have touched on elsewhere i think i may very boldly object to the censures of any one past upon works which he hath not himself read
such censurers as these whether they speak from their own guess or suspicion or from the report and opinion of others may properly be said to slander the reputation of the book they condemn
such may likewise be suspected of deserving this character who without assigning any particular faults condemn the whole in general defamatory terms such as vile dull dd stuff c and particularly by the use of the monosyllable low a word which becomes the mouth of no critic who is not right honourable
again though there may be some faults justly assigned in the work yet if those are not in the most essential parts or if they are compensated by greater beauties it will savour rather of the malice of a slanderer than of the judgment of a true critic to pass a severe sentence upon the whole merely on account of some vicious part
this is directly contrary to the sentiments of horace       verum ubi plura nitent in carmine non ego paucis      offendor maculis quas aut incuria fudit      aut humana parum cavit natura       but where the beauties more in number shine      i am not angry when a casual line      that with some trivial faults unequal flows      a careless hand or human frailty showsmr francis
for as martial says aliter non fit avite liber
no book can be otherwise composed
all beauty of character as well as of countenance and indeed of everything human is to be tried in this manner
cruel indeed would it be if such a work as this history which hath employed some thousands of hours in the composing should be liable to be condemned because some particular chapter or perhaps chapters may be obnoxious to very just and sensible objections
and yet nothing is more common than the most rigorous sentence upon books supported by such objections which if they were rightly taken and that they are not always do by no means go to the merit of the whole
in the theatre especially a single expression which doth not coincide with the taste of the audience or with any individual critic of that audience is sure to be hissed and one scene which should be disapproved would hazard the whole piece
to write within such severe rules as these is as impossible as to live up to some splenetic opinions and if we judge according to the sentiments of some critics and of some christians no author will be saved in this world and no man in the next
chapter ii
the adventures which sophia met with after her leaving upton
our history just before it was obliged to turn about and travel backwards had mentioned the departure of sophia and her maid from the inn we shall now therefore pursue the steps of that lovely creature and leave her unworthy lover a little longer to bemoan his illluck or rather his illconduct
sophia having directed her guide to travel through byeroads across the country they now passed the severn and had scarce got a mile from the inn when the young lady looking behind her saw several horses coming after on full speed
this greatly alarmed her fears and she called to the guide to put on as fast as possible
he immediately obeyed her and away they rode a full gallop
but the faster they went the faster were they followed and as the horses behind were somewhat swifter than those before so the former were at length overtaken
a happy circumstance for poor sophia whose fears joined to her fatigue had almost overpowered her spirits but she was now instantly relieved by a female voice that greeted her in the softest manner and with the utmost civility
this greeting sophia as soon as she could recover her breath with like civility and with the highest satisfaction to herself returned
the travellers who joined sophia and who had given her such terror consisted like her own company of two females and a guide
the two parties proceeded three full miles together before any one offered again to open their mouths when our heroine having pretty well got the better of her fear but yet being somewhat surprized that the other still continued to attend her as she pursued no great road and had already passed through several turnings accosted the strange lady in a most obliging tone and said she was very happy to find they were both travelling the same way the other who like a ghost only wanted to be spoke to readily answered that the happiness was entirely hers that she was a perfect stranger in that country and was so overjoyed at meeting a companion of her own sex that she had perhaps been guilty of an impertinence which required great apology in keeping pace with her more civilities passed between these two ladies for mrs honour had now given place to the fine habit of the stranger and had fallen into the rear
but though sophia had great curiosity to know why the other lady continued to travel on through the same byeroads with herself nay though this gave her some uneasiness yet fear or modesty or some other consideration restrained her from asking the question
the strange lady now laboured under a difficulty which appears almost below the dignity of history to mention
her bonnet had been blown from her head not less than five times within the last mile nor could she come at any ribbon or handkerchief to tie it under her chin
when sophia was informed of this she immediately supplied her with a handkerchief for this purpose which while she was pulling from her pocket she perhaps too much neglected the management of her horse for the beast now unluckily making a false step fell upon his forelegs and threw his fair rider from his back
though sophia came head foremost to the ground she happily received not the least damage and the same circumstances which had perhaps contributed to her fall now preserved her from confusion for the lane which they were then passing was narrow and very much overgrown with trees so that the moon could here afford very little light and was moreover at present so obscured in a cloud that it was almost perfectly dark
by these means the young lady's modesty which was extremely delicate escaped as free from injury as her limbs and she was once more reinstated in her saddle having received no other harm than a little fright by her fall
daylight at length appeared in its full lustre and now the two ladies who were riding over a common side by side looking stedfastly at each other at the same moment both their eyes became fixed both their horses stopt and both speaking together with equal joy pronounced the one the name of sophia the other that of harriet
this unexpected encounter surprized the ladies much more than i believe it will the sagacious reader who must have imagined that the strange lady could be no other than mrs fitzpatrick the cousin of miss western whom we before mentioned to have sallied from the inn a few minutes after her
so great was the surprize and joy which these two cousins conceived at this meeting for they had formerly been most intimate acquaintance and friends and had long lived together with their aunt western that it is impossible to recount half the congratulations which passed between them before either asked a very natural question of the other namely whither she was going
this at last however came first from mrs fitzpatrick but easy and natural as the question may seem sophia found it difficult to give it a very ready and certain answer
she begged her cousin therefore to suspend all curiosity till they arrived at some inn which i suppose says she can hardly be far distant and believe me harriet i suspend as much curiosity on my side for indeed i believe our astonishment is pretty equal  the conversation which passed between these ladies on the road was i apprehend little worth relating and less certainly was that between the two waitingwomen for they likewise began to pay their compliments to each other
as for the guides they were debarred from the pleasure of discourse the one being placed in the van and the other obliged to bring up the rear
in this posture they travelled many hours till they came into a wide and wellbeaten road which as they turned to the right soon brought them to a very fair promising inn where they all alighted but so fatigued was sophia that as she had sat her horse during the last five or six miles with great difficulty so was she now incapable of dismounting from him without assistance
this the landlord who had hold of her horse presently perceiving offered to lift her in his arms from her saddle and she too readily accepted the tender of his service
indeed fortune seems to have resolved to put sophia to the blush that day and the second malicious attempt succeeded better than the first for my landlord had no sooner received the young lady in his arms than his feet which the gout had lately very severely handled gave way and down he tumbled but at the same time with no less dexterity than gallantry contrived to throw himself under his charming burden so that he alone received any bruise from the fall for the great injury which happened to sophia was a violent shock given to her modesty by an immoderate grin which at her rising from the ground she observed in the countenances of most of the byestanders
this made her suspect what had really happened and what we shall not here relate for the indulgence of those readers who are capable of laughing at the offence given to a young lady's delicacy
accidents of this kind we have never regarded in a comical light nor will we scruple to say that he must have a very inadequate idea of the modesty of a beautiful young woman who would wish to sacrifice it to so paltry a satisfaction as can arise from laughter
this fright and shock joined to the violent fatigue which both her mind and body had undergone almost overcame the excellent constitution of sophia and she had scarce strength sufficient to totter into the inn leaning on the arm of her maid
here she was no sooner seated than she called for a glass of water but mrs honour very judiciously in my opinion changed it into a glass of wine
mrs fitzpatrick hearing from mrs honour that sophia had not been in bed during the two last nights and observing her to look very pale and wan with her fatigue earnestly entreated her to refresh herself with some sleep
she was yet a stranger to her history or her apprehensions but had she known both she would have given the same advice for rest was visibly necessary for her and their long journey through byeroads so entirely removed all danger of pursuit that she was herself perfectly easy on that account
sophia was easily prevailed on to follow the counsel of her friend which was heartily seconded by her maid
mrs fitzpatrick likewise offered to bear her cousin company which sophia with much complacence accepted
the mistress was no sooner in bed than the maid prepared to follow her example
she began to make many apologies to her sister abigail for leaving her alone in so horrid a place as an inn but the other stopt her short being as well inclined to a nap as herself and desired the honour of being her bedfellow
sophia's maid agreed to give her a share of her bed but put in her claim to all the honour
so after many courtsies and compliments to bed together went the waitingwomen as their mistresses had done before them
it was usual with my landlord as indeed it is with the whole fraternity to enquire particularly of all coachmen footmen postboys and others into the names of all his guests what their estate was and where it lay
it cannot therefore be wondered at that the many particular circumstances which attended our travellers and especially their retiring all to sleep at so extraordinary and unusual an hour as ten in the morning should excite his curiosity
as soon therefore as the guides entered the kitchen he began to examine who the ladies were and whence they came but the guides though they faithfully related all they knew gave him very little satisfaction
on the contrary they rather enflamed his curiosity than extinguished it
this landlord had the character among all his neighbours of being a very sagacious fellow
he was thought to see farther and deeper into things than any man in the parish the parson himself not excepted
perhaps his look had contributed not a little to procure him this reputation for there was in this something wonderfully wise and significant especially when he had a pipe in his mouth which indeed he seldom was without
his behaviour likewise greatly assisted in promoting the opinion of his wisdom
in his deportment he was solemn if not sullen and when he spoke which was seldom he always delivered himself in a slow voice and though his sentences were short they were still interrupted with many hums and ha's ay ays and other expletives so that though he accompanied his words with certain explanatory gestures such as shaking or nodding the head or pointing with his forefinger he generally left his hearers to understand more than he expressed nay he commonly gave them a hint that he knew much more than he thought proper to disclose
this last circumstance alone may indeed very well account for his character of wisdom since men are strangely inclined to worship what they do not understand
a grand secret upon which several imposers on mankind have totally relied for the success of their frauds
this polite person now taking his wife aside asked her what she thought of the ladies lately arrived think of them said the wife why what should i think of them i know answered he what i think
the guides tell strange stories
one pretends to be come from gloucester and the other from upton and neither of them for what i can find can tell whither they are going
but what people ever travel across the country from upton hither especially to london
and one of the maidservants before she alighted from her horse asked if this was not the london road
now i have put all these circumstances together and whom do you think i have found them out to be nay  answered she you know i never pretend to guess at your discoveriesit is a good girl replied he chucking her under the chin i must own you have always submitted to my knowledge of these matters
why then depend upon it mind what i saydepend upon it they are certainly some of the rebel ladies who they say travel with the young chevalier and have taken a roundabout way to escape the duke's army  husband quoth the wife you have certainly hit it for one of them is dressed as fine as any princess and to be sure she looks for all the world like onebut yet when i consider one thingwhen you consider cries the landlord contemptuouslycome pray let's hear what you considerwhy it is answered the wife that she is too humble to be any very great lady for while our betty was warming the bed she called her nothing but child and my dear and sweetheart and when betty offered to pull off her shoes and stockings she would not suffer her saying she would not give her the trouble  pugh answered the husband that is nothing
dost think because you have seen some great ladies rude and uncivil to persons below them that none of them know how to behave themselves when they come before their inferiors
i think i know people of fashion when i see themi think i do
did not she call for a glass of water when she came in
another sort of women would have called for a dram you know they would
if she be not a woman of very great quality sell me for a fool and i believe those who buy me will have a bad bargain
now would a woman of her quality travel without a footman unless upon some such extraordinary occasion nay to be sure husband cries she you know these matters better than i or most folk i think i do know something said he
to be sure answered the wife the poor little heart looked so piteous when she sat down in the chair i protest i could not help having a compassion for her almost as much as if she had been a poor body
but what's to be done husband
if an she be a rebel i suppose you intend to betray her up to the court
well she's a sweettempered goodhumoured lady be she what she will and i shall hardly refrain from crying when i hear she is hanged or beheaded pooh answered the husbandbut as to what's to be done it is not so easy a matter to determine
i hope before she goes away we shall have the news of a battle for if the chevalier should get the better she may gain us interest at court and make our fortunes without betraying her why that's true replied the wife and i heartily hope she will have it in her power
certainly she's a sweet good lady it would go horribly against me to have her come to any harm pooh cries the landlord women are always so tenderhearted
why you would not harbour rebels would you no certainly answered the wife and as for betraying her come what will on't nobody can blame us
it is what anybody would do in our case  while our politic landlord who had not we see undeservedly the reputation of great wisdom among his neighbours was engaged in debating this matter with himself for he paid little attention to the opinion of his wife news arrived that the rebels had given the duke the slip and had got a day's march towards london and soon after arrived a famous jacobite squire who with great joy in his countenance shook the landlord by the hand saying all's our own boy ten thousand honest frenchmen are landed in suffolk
old england for ever
ten thousand french my brave lad
i am going to tap away directly  this news determined the opinion of the wise man and he resolved to make his court to the young lady when she arose for he had now he said discovered that she was no other than madam jenny cameron herself
chapter iii
a very short chapter in which however is a sun a moon a star and an angel
the sun for he keeps very good hours at this time of the year had been some time retired to rest when sophia arose greatly refreshed by her sleep which short as it was nothing but her extreme fatigue could have occasioned for though she had told her maid and perhaps herself too that she was perfectly easy when she left upton yet it is certain her mind was a little affected with that malady which is attended with all the restless symptoms of a fever and is perhaps the very distemper which physicians mean if they mean anything by the fever on the spirits
mrs fitzpatrick likewise left her bed at the same time and having summoned her maid immediately dressed herself
she was really a very pretty woman and had she been in any other company but that of sophia might have been thought beautiful but when mrs honour of her own accord attended for her mistress would not suffer her to be waked and had equipped our heroine the charms of mrs fitzpatrick who had performed the office of the morningstar and had preceded greater glories shared the fate of that star and were totally eclipsed the moment those glories shone forth
perhaps sophia never looked more beautiful than she did at this instant
we ought not therefore to condemn the maid of the inn for her hyperbole who when she descended after having lighted the fire declared and ratified it with an oath that if ever there was an angel upon earth she was now abovestairs
sophia had acquainted her cousin with her design to go to london and mrs fitzpatrick had agreed to accompany her for the arrival of her husband at upton had put an end to her design of going to bath or to her aunt western
they had therefore no sooner finished their tea than sophia proposed to set out the moon then shining extremely bright and as for the frost she defied it nor had she any of those apprehensions which many young ladies would have felt at travelling by night for she had as we have before observed some little degree of natural courage and this her present sensations which bordered somewhat on despair greatly encreased
besides as she had already travelled twice with safety by the light of the moon she was the better emboldened to trust to it a third time
the disposition of mrs fitzpatrick was more timorous for though the greater terrors had conquered the less and the presence of her husband had driven her away at so unseasonable an hour from upton yet being now arrived at a place where she thought herself safe from his pursuit these lesser terrors of i know not what operated so strongly that she earnestly entreated her cousin to stay till the next morning and not expose herself to the dangers of travelling by night
sophia who was yielding to an excess when she could neither laugh nor reason her cousin out of these apprehensions at last gave way to them
perhaps indeed had she known of her father's arrival at upton it might have been more difficult to have persuaded her for as to jones she had i am afraid no great horror at the thoughts of being overtaken by him nay to confess the truth i believe she rather wished than feared it though i might honestly enough have concealed this wish from the reader as it was one of those secret spontaneous emotions of the soul to which the reason is often a stranger
when our young ladies had determined to remain all that evening in their inn they were attended by the landlady who desired to know what their ladyships would be pleased to eat
such charms were there in the voice in the manner and in the affable deportment of sophia that she ravished the landlady to the highest degree and that good woman concluding that she had attended jenny cameron became in a moment a stanch jacobite and wished heartily well to the young pretender's cause from the great sweetness and affability with which she had been treated by his supposed mistress
the two cousins began now to impart to each other their reciprocal curiosity to know what extraordinary accidents on both sides occasioned this so strange and unexpected meeting
at last mrs fitzpatrick having obtained of sophia a promise of communicating likewise in her turn began to relate what the reader if he is desirous to know her history may read in the ensuing chapter
chapter iv
the history of mrs fitzpatrick
mrs fitzpatrick after a silence of a few moments fetching a deep sigh thus began  it is natural to the unhappy to feel a secret concern in recollecting those periods of their lives which have been most delightful to them
the remembrance of past pleasures affects us with a kind of tender grief like what we suffer for departed friends and the ideas of both may be said to haunt our imaginations
for this reason i never reflect without sorrow on those days the happiest far of my life which we spent together when both were under the care of my aunt western
alas
why are miss graveairs and miss giddy no more
you remember i am sure when we knew each other by no other names
indeed you gave the latter appellation with too much cause
i have since experienced how much i deserved it
you my sophia was always my superior in everything and i heartily hope you will be so in your fortune
i shall never forget the wise and matronly advice you once gave me when i lamented being disappointed of a ball though you could not be then fourteen years oldo my sophy how blest must have been my situation when i could think such a disappointment a misfortune and when indeed it was the greatest i had ever known  and yet my dear harriet answered sophia it was then a serious matter with you
comfort yourself therefore with thinking that whatever you now lament may hereafter appear as trifling and contemptible as a ball would at this time  alas my sophia replied the other lady you yourself will think otherwise of my present situation for greatly must that tender heart be altered if my misfortunes do not draw many a sigh nay many a tear from you
the knowledge of this should perhaps deter me from relating what i am convinced will so much affect you here mrs fitzpatrick stopt till at the repeated entreaties of sophia she thus proceeded  though you must have heard much of my marriage yet as matters may probably have been misrepresented i will set out from the very commencement of my unfortunate acquaintance with my present husband which was at bath soon after you left my aunt and returned home to your father
among the gay young fellows who were at this season at bath mr fitzpatrick was one
he was handsome dgag extremely gallant and in his dress exceeded most others
in short my dear if you was unluckily to see him now i could describe him no better than by telling you he was the very reverse of everything which he is for he hath rusticated himself so long that he is become an absolute wild irishman
but to proceed in my story the qualifications which he then possessed so well recommended him that though the people of quality at that time lived separate from the rest of the company and excluded them from all their parties mr fitzpatrick found means to gain admittance
it was perhaps no easy matter to avoid him for he required very little or no invitation and as being handsome and genteel he found it no very difficult matter to ingratiate himself with the ladies so he having frequently drawn his sword the men did not care publickly to affront him
had it not been for some such reason i believe he would have been soon expelled by his own sex for surely he had no strict title to be preferred to the english gentry nor did they seem inclined to show him any extraordinary favour
they all abused him behind his back which might probably proceed from envy for by the women he was well received and very particularly distinguished by them
my aunt though no person of quality herself as she had always lived about the court was enrolled in that party for by whatever means you get into the polite circle when you are once there it is sufficient merit for you that you are there
this observation young as you was you could scarce avoid making from my aunt who was free or reserved with all people just as they had more or less of this merit
and this merit i believe it was which principally recommended mr fitzpatrick to her favour
in which he so well succeeded that he was always one of her private parties
nor was he backward in returning such distinction for he soon grew so very particular in his behaviour to her that the scandal club first began to take notice of it and the betterdisposed persons made a match between them
for my own part i confess i made no doubt but that his designs were strictly honourable as the phrase is that is to rob a lady of her fortune by way of marriage
my aunt was i conceived neither young enough nor handsome enough to attract much wicked inclination but she had matrimonial charms in great abundance
i was the more confirmed in this opinion from the extraordinary respect which he showed to myself from the first moment of our acquaintance
this i understood as an attempt to lessen if possible that disinclination which my interest might be supposed to give me towards the match and i know not but in some measure it had that effect for as i was well contented with my own fortune and of all people the least a slave to interested views so i could not be violently the enemy of a man with whose behaviour to me i was greatly pleased and the more so as i was the only object of such respect for he behaved at the same time to many women of quality without any respect at all
agreeable as this was to me he soon changed it into another kind of behaviour which was perhaps more so
he now put on much softness and tenderness and languished and sighed abundantly
at times indeed whether from art or nature i will not determine he gave his usual loose to gaiety and mirth but this was always in general company and with other women for even in a countrydance when he was not my partner he became grave and put on the softest look imaginable the moment he approached me
indeed he was in all things so very particular towards me that i must have been blind not to have discovered it
and and and and you was more pleased still my dear harriet cries sophia you need not be ashamed added she sighing for sure there are irresistible charms in tenderness which too many men are able to affect true answered her cousin men who in all other instances want common sense are very machiavels in the art of loving
i wish i did not know an instancewell scandal now began to be as busy with me as it had before been with my aunt and some good ladies did not scruple to affirm that mr fitzpatrick had an intrigue with us both
but what may seem astonishing my aunt never saw nor in the least seemed to suspect that which was visible enough i believe from both our behaviours
one would indeed think that love quite puts out the eyes of an old woman
in fact they so greedily swallow the addresses which are made to them that like an outrageous glutton they are not at leisure to observe what passes amongst others at the same table
this i have observed in more cases than my own and this was so strongly verified by my aunt that though she often found us together at her return from the pump the least canting word of his pretending impatience at her absence effectually smothered all suspicion
one artifice succeeded with her to admiration
this was his treating me like a little child and never calling me by any other name in her presence but that of pretty miss
this indeed did him some disservice with your humble servant but i soon saw through it especially as in her absence he behaved to me as i have said in a different manner
however if i was not greatly disobliged by a conduct of which i had discovered the design i smarted very severely for it for my aunt really conceived me to be what her lover as she thought him called me and treated me in all respects as a perfect infant
to say the truth i wonder she had not insisted on my again wearing leadingstrings
at last my lover for so he was thought proper in a most solemn manner to disclose a secret which i had known long before
he now placed all the love which he had pretended to my aunt to my account
he lamented in very pathetic terms the encouragement she had given him and made a high merit of the tedious hours in which he had undergone her conversationwhat shall i tell you my dear sophiathen i will confess the truth
i was pleased with my man
i was pleased with my conquest
to rival my aunt delighted me to rival so many other women charmed me
in short i am afraid i did not behave as i should do even upon the very first declarationi wish i did not almost give him positive encouragement before we parted
the bath now talked loudlyi might almost say roared against me
several young women affected to shun my acquaintance not so much perhaps from any real suspicion as from a desire of banishing me from a company in which i too much engrossed their favourite man
and here i cannot omit expressing my gratitude to the kindness intended me by mr nash who took me one day aside and gave me advice which if i had followed i had been a happy woman
child' says he i am sorry to see the familiarity which subsists between you and a fellow who is altogether unworthy of you and i am afraid will prove your ruin
as for your old stinking aunt if it was to be no injury to you and my pretty sophy western i assure you i repeat his words i should be heartily glad that the fellow was in possession of all that belongs to her
i never advise old women for if they take it into their heads to go to the devil it is no more possible than worth while to keep them from him
innocence and youth and beauty are worthy a better fate and i would save them from his clutches
let me advise you therefore dear child never suffer this fellow to be particular with you again'
many more things he said to me which i have now forgotten and indeed i attended very little to them at the time for inclination contradicted all he said and besides i could not be persuaded that women of quality would condescend to familiarity with such a person as he described
but i am afraid my dear i shall tire you with a detail of so many minute circumstances
to be concise therefore imagine me married imagine me with my husband at the feet of my aunt and then imagine the maddest woman in bedlam in a raving fit and your imagination will suggest to you no more than what really happened
the very next day my aunt left the place partly to avoid seeing mr fitzpatrick or myself and as much perhaps to avoid seeing any one else for though i am told she hath since denied everything stoutly i believe she was then a little confounded at her disappointment
since that time i have written to her many letters but never could obtain an answer which i must own sits somewhat the heavier as she herself was though undesignedly the occasion of all my sufferings for had it not been under the colour of paying his addresses to her mr fitzpatrick would never have found sufficient opportunities to have engaged my heart which in other circumstances i still flatter myself would not have been an easy conquest to such a person
indeed i believe i should not have erred so grossly in my choice if i had relied on my own judgment but i trusted totally to the opinion of others and very foolishly took the merit of a man for granted whom i saw so universally well received by the women
what is the reason my dear that we who have understandings equal to the wisest and greatest of the other sex so often make choice of the silliest fellows for companions and favourites
it raises my indignation to the highest pitch to reflect on the numbers of women of sense who have been undone by fools here she paused a moment but sophia making no answer she proceeded as in the next chapter
chapter v  in which the history of mrs fitzpatrick is continued
we remained at bath no longer than a fortnight after our wedding for as to any reconciliation with my aunt there were no hopes and of my fortune not one farthing could be touched till i was of age of which i now wanted more than two years
my husband therefore was resolved to set out for ireland against which i remonstrated very earnestly and insisted on a promise which he had made me before our marriage that i should never take this journey against my consent and indeed i never intended to consent to it nor will anybody i believe blame me for that resolution but this however i never mentioned to my husband and petitioned only for the reprieve of a month but he had fixed the day and to that day he obstinately adhered
the evening before our departure as we were disputing this point with great eagerness on both sides he started suddenly from his chair and left me abruptly saying he was going to the rooms
he was hardly out of the house when i saw a paper lying on the floor which i suppose he had carelessly pulled from his pocket together with his handkerchief
this paper i took up and finding it to be a letter i made no scruple to open and read it and indeed i read it so often that i can repeat it to you almost word for word
this then was the letter    'to mr brian fitzpatrick    'sir    'yours received and am surprized you should use me in this manner   as have never seen any of your cash unless for one linseywoolsey   coat and your bill now is upwards of 
consider sir how often   you have fobbed me off with your being shortly to be married to this   lady and t'other lady but i can neither live on hopes or promises   nor will my woollendraper take any such in payment
you tell me you   are secure of having either the aunt or the niece and that you   might have married the aunt before this whose jointure you say is   immense but that you prefer the niece on account of her ready   money
pray sir take a fool's advice for once and marry the first   you can get
you will pardon my offering my advice as you know i   sincerely wish you well
shall draw on you per next post in favour   of messieurs john drugget and company at fourteen days which doubt   not your honouring and am    sir your humble servant 'sam
cosgrave'
this was the letter word for word
guess my dear girlguess how this letter affected me
you prefer the niece on account of her ready money
if every one of these words had been a dagger i could with pleasure have stabbed them into his heart but i will not recount my frantic behaviour on the occasion
i had pretty well spent my tears before his return home but sufficient remains of them appeared in my swollen eyes
he threw himself sullenly into his chair and for a long time we were both silent
at length in a haughty tone he said i hope madam your servants have packed up all your things for the coach will be ready by six in the morning'
my patience was totally subdued by this provocation and i answered no sir there is a letter still remains unpacked' and then throwing it on the table i fell to upbraiding him with the most bitter language i could invent
whether guilt or shame or prudence restrained him i cannot say but though he is the most passionate of men he exerted no rage on this occasion
he endeavoured on the contrary to pacify me by the most gentle means
he swore the phrase in the letter to which i principally objected was not his nor had he ever written any such
he owned indeed the having mentioned his marriage and that preference which he had given to myself but denied with many oaths the having mentioned any such matter at all on account of the straits he was in for money arising he said from his having too long neglected his estate in ireland
and this he said which he could not bear to discover to me was the only reason of his having so strenuously insisted on our journey
he then used several very endearing expressions and concluded by a very fond caress and many violent protestations of love
there was one circumstance which though he did not appeal to it had much weight with me in his favour and that was the word jointure in the taylor's letter whereas my aunt never had been married and this mr fitzpatrick well knewas i imagined therefore that the fellow must have inserted this of his own head or from hearsay i persuaded myself he might have ventured likewise on that odious line on no better authority
what reasoning was this my dear
was i not an advocate rather than a judgebut why do i mention such a circumstance as this or appeal to it for the justification of my forgivenessin short had he been guilty of twenty times as much half the tenderness and fondness which he used would have prevailed on me to have forgiven him
i now made no farther objections to our setting out which we did the next morning and in a little more than a week arrived at the seat of mr fitzpatrick
your curiosity will excuse me from relating any occurrences which past during our journey for it would indeed be highly disagreeable to travel it over again and no less so to you to travel it over with me
this seat then is an ancient mansionhouse if i was in one of those merry humours in which you have so often seen me i could describe it to you ridiculously enough
it looked as if it had been formerly inhabited by a gentleman
here was room enough and not the less room on account of the furniture for indeed there was very little in it
an old woman who seemed coeval with the building and greatly resembled her whom chamont mentions in the orphan received us at the gate and in a howl scarce human and to me unintelligible welcomed her master home
in short the whole scene was so gloomy and melancholy that it threw my spirits into the lowest dejection which my husband discerning instead of relieving encreased by two or three malicious observations
there are good houses madam' says he as you find in other places besides england but perhaps you had rather be in a dirty lodgings at bath'
happy my dear is the woman who in any state of life hath a cheerful goodnatured companion to support and comfort her
but why do i reflect on happy situations only to aggravate my own misery
my companion far from clearing up the gloom of solitude soon convinced me that i must have been wretched with him in any place and in any condition
in a word he was a surly fellow a character perhaps you have never seen for indeed no woman ever sees it exemplified but in a father a brother or a husband and though you have a father he is not of that character
this surly fellow had formerly appeared to me the very reverse and so he did still to every other person
good heaven
how is it possible for a man to maintain a constant lie in his appearance abroad and in company and to content himself with shewing disagreeable truth only at home
here my dear they make themselves amends for the uneasy restraint which they put on their tempers in the world for i have observed the more merry and gay and goodhumoured my husband hath at any time been in company the more sullen and morose he was sure to become at our next private meeting
how shall i describe his barbarity
to my fondness he was cold and insensible
my little comical ways which you my sophy and which others have called so agreeable he treated with contempt
in my most serious moments he sung and whistled and whenever i was thoroughly dejected and miserable he was angry and abused me for though he was never pleased with my goodhumour nor ascribed it to my satisfaction in him yet my low spirits always offended him and those he imputed to my repentance of having as he said married an irishman
you will easily conceive my dear graveairs i ask your pardon i really forgot myself that when a woman makes an imprudent match in the sense of the world that is when she is not an arrant prostitute to pecuniary interest she must necessarily have some inclination and affection for her man
you will as easily believe that this affection may possibly be lessened nay i do assure you contempt will wholly eradicate it
this contempt i now began to entertain for my husband whom i now discovered to bei must use the expressionan arrant blockhead
perhaps you will wonder i did not make this discovery long before but women will suggest a thousand excuses to themselves for the folly of those they like besides give me leave to tell you it requires a most penetrating eye to discern a fool through the disguises of gaiety and good breeding
it will be easily imagined that when i once despised my husband as i confess to you i soon did i must consequently dislike his company and indeed i had the happiness of being very little troubled with it for our house was now most elegantly furnished our cellars well stocked and dogs and horses provided in great abundance
as my gentleman therefore entertained his neighbours with great hospitality so his neighbours resorted to him with great alacrity and sports and drinking consumed so much of his time that a small part of his conversation that is to say of his illhumours fell to my share
happy would it have been for me if i could as easily have avoided all other disagreeable company but alas
i was confined to some which constantly tormented me and the more as i saw no prospect of being relieved from them
these companions were my own racking thoughts which plagued and in a manner haunted me night and day
in this situation i past through a scene the horrors of which can neither be painted nor imagined
think my dear figure if you can to yourself what i must have undergone
i became a mother by the man i scorned hated and detested
i went through all the agonies and miseries of a lyingin ten times more painful in such a circumstance than the worst labour can be when one endures it for a man one loves in a desert or rather indeed a scene of riot and revel without a friend without a companion or without any of those agreeable circumstances which often alleviate and perhaps sometimes more than compensate the sufferings of our sex at that season    chapter vi
in which the mistake of the landlord throws sophia into a dreadful consternation
mrs fitzpatrick was proceeding in her narrative when she was interrupted by the entrance of dinner greatly to the concern of sophia for the misfortunes of her friend had raised her anxiety and left her no appetite but what mrs fitzpatrick was to satisfy by her relation
the landlord now attended with a plate under his arm and with the same respect in his countenance and address which he would have put on had the ladies arrived in a coach and six
the married lady seemed less affected with her own misfortunes than was her cousin for the former eat very heartily whereas the latter could hardly swallow a morsel
sophia likewise showed more concern and sorrow in her countenance than appeared in the other lady who having observed these symptoms in her friend begged her to be comforted saying perhaps all may yet end better than either you or i expect  our landlord thought he had now an opportunity to open his mouth and was resolved not to omit it
i am sorry madam cries he that your ladyship can't eat for to be sure you must be hungry after so long fasting
i hope your ladyship is not uneasy at anything for as madam there says all may end better than anybody expects
a gentleman who was here just now brought excellent news and perhaps some folks who have given other folks the slip may get to london before they are overtaken and if they do i make no doubt but they will find people who will be very ready to receive them  all persons under the apprehension of danger convert whatever they see and hear into the objects of that apprehension
sophia therefore immediately concluded from the foregoing speech that she was known and pursued by her father
she was now struck with the utmost consternation and for a few minutes deprived of the power of speech which she no sooner recovered than she desired the landlord to send his servants out of the room and then addressing herself to him said i perceive sir you know who we are but i beseech younay i am convinced if you have any compassion or goodness you will not betray us  i betray your ladyship quoth the landlord no and then he swore several very hearty oaths i would sooner be cut into ten thousand pieces
i hate all treachery
i
i never betrayed any one in my life yet and i am sure i shall not begin with so sweet a lady as your ladyship
all the world would very much blame me if i should since it will be in your ladyship's power so shortly to reward me
my wife can witness for me i knew your ladyship the moment you came into the house i said it was your honour before i lifted you from your horse and i shall carry the bruises i got in your ladyship's service to the grave but what signified that as long as i saved your ladyship
to be sure some people this morning would have thought of getting a reward but no such thought ever entered into my head
i would sooner starve than take any reward for betraying your ladyship  i promise you sir says sophia if it be ever in my power to reward you you shall not lose by your generosity  alackaday madam answered the landlord in your ladyship's power
heaven put it as much into your will
i am only afraid your honour will forget such a poor man as an innkeeper but if your ladyship should not i hope you will remember what reward i refusedrefused
that is i would have refused and to be sure it may be called refusing for i might have had it certainly and to be sure you might have been in some housesbut for my part would not methinks for the world have your ladyship wrong me so much as to imagine i ever thought of betraying you even before i heard the good news  what news pray says sophia something eagerly
hath not your ladyship heard it then cries the landlord nay like enough for i heard it only a few minutes ago and if i had never heard it may the devil fly away with me this instant if i would have betrayed your honour
no if i would may i here he subjoined several dreadful imprecations which sophia at last interrupted and begged to know what he meant by the newshe was going to answer when mrs honour came running into the room all pale and breathless and cried out madam we are all undone all ruined they are come they are come these words almost froze up the blood of sophia but mrs fitzpatrick asked honour who were comewho answered she why the french several hundred thousands of them are landed and we shall be all murdered and ravished  as a miser who hath in some wellbuilt city a cottage value twenty shillings when at a distance he is alarmed with the news of a fire turns pale and trembles at his loss but when he finds the beautiful palaces only are burnt and his own cottage remains safe he comes instantly to himself and smiles at his good fortunes or as for we dislike something in the former simile the tender mother when terrified with the apprehension that her darling boy is drowned is struck senseless and almost dead with consternation but when she is told that little master is safe and the victory only with twelve hundred brave men gone to the bottom life and sense again return maternal fondness enjoys the sudden relief from all its fears and the general benevolence which at another time would have deeply felt the dreadful catastrophe lies fast asleep in her mindso sophia than whom none was more capable of tenderly feeling the general calamity of her country found such immediate satisfaction from the relief of those terrors she had of being overtaken by her father that the arrival of the french scarce made any impression on her
she gently chid her maid for the fright into which she had thrown her and said she was glad it was no worse for that she had feared somebody else was come  ay ay quoth the landlord smiling her ladyship knows better things she knows the french are our very best friends and come over hither only for our good
they are the people who are to make old england flourish again
i warrant her honour thought the duke was coming and that was enough to put her into a fright
i was going to tell your ladyship the newshis honour's majesty heaven bless him hath given the duke the slip and is marching as fast as he can to london and ten thousand french are landed to join him on the road  sophia was not greatly pleased with this news nor with the gentleman who related it but as she still imagined he knew her for she could not possibly have any suspicion of the real truth she durst not show any dislike
and now the landlord having removed the cloth from the table withdrew but at his departure frequently repeated his hopes of being remembered hereafter
the mind of sophia was not at all easy under the supposition of being known at this house for she still applied to herself many things which the landlord had addressed to jenny cameron she therefore ordered her maid to pump out of him by what means he had become acquainted with her person and who had offered him the reward for betraying her she likewise ordered the horses to be in readiness by four in the morning at which hour mrs fitzpatrick promised to bear her company and then composing herself as well as she could she desired that lady to continue her story
chapter vii
in which mrs fitzpatrick concludes her history
while mrs honour in pursuance of the commands of her mistress ordered a bowl of punch and invited my landlord and landlady to partake of it mrs fitzpatrick thus went on with her relation
most of the officers who were quartered at a town in our neighbourhood were of my husband's acquaintance
among these there was a lieutenant a very pretty sort of man and who was married to a woman so agreeable both in her temper and conversation that from our first knowing each other which was soon after my lyingin we were almost inseparable companions for i had the good fortune to make myself equally agreeable to her
the lieutenant who was neither a sot nor a sportsman was frequently of our parties indeed he was very little with my husband and no more than good breeding constrained him to be as he lived almost constantly at our house
my husband often expressed much dissatisfaction at the lieutenant's preferring my company to his he was very angry with me on that account and gave me many a hearty curse for drawing away his companions saying i ought to be dn'd for having spoiled one of the prettiest fellows in the world by making a milksop of him'
you will be mistaken my dear sophia if you imagine that the anger of my husband arose from my depriving him of a companion for the lieutenant was not a person with whose society a fool could be pleased and if i should admit the possibility of this so little right had my husband to place the loss of his companion to me that i am convinced it was my conversation alone which induced him ever to come to the house
no child it was envy the worst and most rancorous kind of envy the envy of superiority of understanding
the wretch could not bear to see my conversation preferred to his by a man of whom he could not entertain the least jealousy
o my dear sophy you are a woman of sense if you marry a man as is most probable you will of less capacity than yourself make frequent trials of his temper before marriage and see whether he can bear to submit to such a superioritypromise me sophy you will take this advice for you will hereafter find its importance it is very likely i shall never marry at all answered sophia i think at least i shall never marry a man in whose understanding i see any defects before marriage and i promise you i would rather give up my own than see any such afterwards give up your understanding  replied mrs fitzpatrick oh fie child
i will not believe so meanly of you
everything else i might myself be brought to give up but never this
nature would not have allotted this superiority to the wife in so many instances if she had intended we should all of us have surrendered it to the husband
this indeed men of sense never expect of us of which the lieutenant i have just mentioned was one notable example for though he had a very good understanding he always acknowledged as was really true that his wife had a better
and this perhaps was one reason of the hatred my tyrant bore her
before he would be so governed by a wife he said especially such an ugly b for indeed she was not a regular beauty but very agreeable and extremely genteel he would see all the women upon earth at the devil which was a very usual phrase with him
he said he wondered what i could see in her to be so charmed with her company since this woman says he hath come among us there is an end of your beloved reading which you pretended to like so much that you could not afford time to return the visits of the ladies in this country and i must confess i had been guilty of a little rudeness this way for the ladies there are at least no better than the mere country ladies here and i think i need make no other excuse to you for declining any intimacy with them
this correspondence however continued a whole year even all the while the lieutenant was quartered in that town for which i was contented to pay the tax of being constantly abused in the manner above mentioned by my husband i mean when he was at home for he was frequently absent a month at a time at dublin and once made a journey of two months to london in all which journeys i thought it a very singular happiness that he never once desired my company nay by his frequent censures on men who could not travel as he phrased it without a wife tied up to their tail he sufficiently intimated that had i been never so desirous of accompanying him my wishes would have been in vain but heaven knows such wishes were very far from my thoughts
at length my friend was removed from me and i was again left to my solitude to the tormenting conversation with my own reflections and to apply to books for my only comfort
i now read almost all day long
how many books do you think i read in three months i can't guess indeed cousin answered sophia
perhaps half a score half a score
half a thousand child answered the other
i read a good deal in daniel's english history of france a great deal in plutarch's lives the atalantis pope's homer dryden's plays chillingworth the countess d'aulnois and locke's human understanding
during this interval i wrote three very supplicating and i thought moving letters to my aunt but as i received no answer to any of them my disdain would not suffer me to continue my application here she stopt and looking earnestly at sophia said methinks my dear i read something in your eyes which reproaches me of a neglect in another place where i should have met with a kinder return indeed dear harriet answered sophia your story is an apology for any neglect but indeed i feel that i have been guilty of a remissness without so good an excuseyet pray proceed for i long though i tremble to hear the end  thus then mrs fitzpatrick resumed her narrativemy husband now took a second journey to england where he continued upwards of three months during the greater part of this time i led a life which nothing but having led a worse could make me think tolerable for perfect solitude can never be reconciled to a social mind like mine but when it relieves you from the company of those you hate
what added to my wretchedness was the loss of my little infant not that i pretend to have had for it that extravagant tenderness of which i believe i might have been capable under other circumstances but i resolved in every instance to discharge the duty of the tenderest mother and this care prevented me from feeling the weight of that heaviest of all things when it can be at all said to lie heavy on our hands
i had spent full ten weeks almost entirely by myself having seen nobody all that time except my servants and a very few visitors when a young lady a relation to my husband came from a distant part of ireland to visit me
she had staid once before a week at my house and then i gave her a pressing invitation to return for she was a very agreeable woman and had improved good natural parts by a proper education
indeed she was to me a welcome guest
a few days after her arrival perceiving me in very low spirits without enquiring the cause which indeed she very well knew the young lady fell to compassionating my case
she said though politeness had prevented me from complaining to my husband's relations of his behaviour yet they all were very sensible of it and felt great concern upon that account but none more than herself'
and after some more general discourse on this head which i own i could not forbear countenancing at last after much previous precaution and enjoined concealment she communicated to me as a profound secretthat my husband kept a mistress
you will certainly imagine i heard this news with the utmost insensibilityupon my word if you do your imagination will mislead you
contempt had not so kept down my anger to my husband but that hatred rose again on this occasion
what can be the reason of this
are we so abominably selfish that we can be concerned at others having possession even of what we despise
or are we not rather abominably vain and is not this the greatest injury done to our vanity
what think you sophia  i don't know indeed answered sophia i have never troubled myself with any of these deep contemplations but i think the lady did very ill in communicating to you such a secret  and yet my dear this conduct is natural replied mrs fitzpatrick and when you have seen and read as much as myself you will acknowledge it to be so  i am sorry to hear it is natural returned sophia for i want neither reading nor experience to convince me that it is very dishonourable and very illnatured nay it is surely as illbred to tell a husband or wife of the faults of each other as to tell them of their own  well continued mrs fitzpatrick my husband at last returned and if i am thoroughly acquainted with my own thoughts i hated him now more than ever but i despised him rather less for certainly nothing so much weakens our contempt as an injury done to our pride or our vanity
he now assumed a carriage to me so very different from what he had lately worn and so nearly resembling his behaviour the first week of our marriage that had i now had any spark of love remaining he might possibly have rekindled my fondness for him
but though hatred may succeed to contempt and may perhaps get the better of it love i believe cannot
the truth is the passion of love is too restless to remain contented without the gratification which it receives from its object and one can no more be inclined to love without loving than we can have eyes without seeing
when a husband therefore ceases to be the object of this passion it is most probable some other mani say my dear if your husband grows indifferent to youif you once come to despise himi saythat isif you have the passion of love in youlud
i have bewildered myself sobut one is apt in these abstracted considerations to lose the concatenation of ideas as mr locke saysin short the truth isin short i scarce know what it is but as i was saying my husband returned and his behaviour at first greatly surprized me but he soon acquainted me with the motive and taught me to account for it
in a word then he had spent and lost all the ready money of my fortune and as he could mortgage his own estate no deeper he was now desirous to supply himself with cash for his extravagance by selling a little estate of mine which he could not do without my assistance and to obtain this favour was the whole and sole motive of all the fondness which he now put on
with this i peremptorily refused to comply
i told him and i told him truly that had i been possessed of the indies at our first marriage he might have commanded it all for it had been a constant maxim with me that where a woman disposes of her heart she should always deposit her fortune but as he had been so kind long ago to restore the former into my possession i was resolved likewise to retain what little remained of the latter
i will not describe to you the passion into which these words and the resolute air in which they were spoken threw him nor will i trouble you with the whole scene which succeeded between us
out came you may be well assured the story of the mistress and out it did come with all the embellishments which anger and disdain could bestow upon it
mr fitzpatrick seemed a little thunderstruck with this and more confused than i had seen him though his ideas are always confused enough heaven knows
he did not however endeavour to exculpate himself but took a method which almost equally confounded me
what was this but recrimination
he affected to be jealoushe may for aught i know be inclined enough to jealousy in his natural temper nay he must have had it from nature or the devil must have put it into his head for i defy all the world to cast a just aspersion on my character nay the most scandalous tongues have never dared censure my reputation
my fame i thank heaven hath been always as spotless as my life and let falsehood itself accuse that if it dare
no my dear graveairs however provoked however illtreated however injured in my love i have firmly resolved never to give the least room for censure on this accountand yet my dear there are some people so malicious some tongues so venomous that no innocence can escape them
the most undesigned word the most accidental look the least familiarity the most innocent freedom will be misconstrued and magnified into i know not what by some people
but i despise my dear graveairs i despise all such slander
no such malice i assure you ever gave me an uneasy moment
no no i promise you i am above all thatbut where was i
o let me see i told you my husband was jealousand of whom i praywhy of whom but the lieutenant i mentioned to you before
he was obliged to resort above a year and more back to find any object for this unaccountable passion if indeed he really felt any such and was not an arrant counterfeit in order to abuse me
but i have tired you already with too many particulars
i will now bring my story to a very speedy conclusion
in short then after many scenes very unworthy to be repeated in which my cousin engaged so heartily on my side that mr fitzpatrick at last turned her out of doors when he found i was neither to be soothed nor bullied into compliance he took a very violent method indeed
perhaps you will conclude he beat me but this though he hath approached very near to it he never actually did
he confined me to my room without suffering me to have either pen ink paper or book and a servant every day made my bed and brought me my food
when i had remained a week under this imprisonment he made me a visit and with the voice of a schoolmaster or what is often much the same of a tyrant asked me if i would yet comply'
i answered very stoutly that i would die first'
then so you shall and be dnd'
cries he for you shall never go alive out of this room'
here i remained a fortnight longer and to say the truth my constancy was almost subdued and i began to think of submission when one day in the absence of my husband who was gone abroad for some short time by the greatest good fortune in the world an accident happenediat a time when i began to give way to the utmost despaireverything would be excusable at such a timeat that very time i receivedbut it would take up an hour to tell you all particularsin one word then for i will not tire you with circumstances gold the common key to all padlocks opened my door and set me at liberty
i now made haste to dublin where i immediately procured a passage to england and was proceeding to bath in order to throw myself into the protection of my aunt or of your father or of any relation who would afford it me
my husband overtook me last night at the inn where i lay and which you left a few minutes before me but i had the good luck to escape him and to follow you
and thus my dear ends my history a tragical one i am sure it is to myself but perhaps i ought rather to apologize to you for its dullness  sophia heaved a deep sigh and answered indeed harriet i pity you from my soulbut what could you expect
why why would you marry an irishman  upon my word replied her cousin your censure is unjust
there are among the irish men of as much worth and honour as any among the english nay to speak the truth generosity of spirit is rather more common among them
i have known some examples there too of good husbands and i believe these are not very plenty in england
ask me rather what i could expect when i married a fool and i will tell you a solemn truth i did not know him to be socan no man said sophia in a very low and altered voice do you think make a bad husband who is not a fool that answered the other is too general a negative but none i believe is so likely as a fool to prove so
among my acquaintance the silliest fellows are the worst husbands and i will venture to assert as a fact that a man of sense rarely behaves very ill to a wife who deserves very well    chapter viii
a dreadful alarm in the inn with the arrival of an unexpected friend of mrs fitzpatrick
sophia now at the desire of her cousin relatednot what follows but what hath gone before in this history for which reason the reader will i suppose excuse me for not repeating it over again
one remark however i cannot forbear making on her narrative namely that she made no more mention of jones from the beginning to the end than if there had been no such person alive
this i will neither endeavour to account for nor to excuse
indeed if this may be called a kind of dishonesty it seems the more inexcusable from the apparent openness and explicit sincerity of the other ladybut so it was
just as sophia arrived at the conclusion of her story there arrived in the room where the two ladies were sitting a noise not unlike in loudness to that of a pack of hounds just let out from their kennel nor in shrillness to cats when caterwauling or to screech owls or indeed more like for what animal can resemble a human voice
to those sounds which in the pleasant mansions of that gate which seems to derive its name from a duplicity of tongues issue from the mouths and sometimes from the nostrils of those fair river nymphs ycleped of old the naades in the vulgar tongue translated oysterwenches for when instead of the antient libations of milk and honey and oil the rich distillation from the juniperberry or perhaps from malt hath by the early devotion of their votaries been poured forth in great abundance should any daring tongue with unhallowed license prophane ie depreciate the delicate fat milton oyster the plaice sound and firm the flounder as much alive as when in the water the shrimp as big as a prawn the fine cod alive but a few hours ago or any other of the various treasures which those waterdeities who fish the sea and rivers have committed to the care of the nymphs the angry naades lift up their immortal voices and the prophane wretch is struck deaf for his impiety
such was the noise which now burst from one of the rooms below and soon the thunder which long had rattled at a distance began to approach nearer and nearer till having ascended by degrees upstairs it at last entered the apartment where the ladies were
in short to drop all metaphor and figure mrs honour having scolded violently belowstairs and continued the same all the way up came in to her mistress in a most outrageous passion crying out what doth your ladyship think
would you imagine that this impudent villain the master of this house hath had the impudence to tell me nay to stand it out to my face that your ladyship is that nasty stinking whre jenny cameron they call her that runs about the country with the pretender
nay the lying saucy villain had the assurance to tell me that your ladyship had owned yourself to be so but i have clawed the rascal i have left the marks of my nails in his impudent face
my lady
says i you saucy scoundrel my lady is meat for no pretenders
she is a young lady of as good fashion and family and fortune as any in somersetshire
did you never hear of the great squire western sirrah
she is his only daughter she is and heiress to all his great estate
my lady to be called a nasty scotch whre by such a varletto be sure i wish i had knocked his brains out with the punchbowl  the principal uneasiness with which sophia was affected on this occasion honour had herself caused by having in her passion discovered who she was
however as this mistake of the landlord sufficiently accounted for those passages which sophia had before mistaken she acquired some ease on that account nor could she upon the whole forbear smiling
this enraged honour and she cried indeed madam i did not think your ladyship would have made a laughing matter of it
to be called whore by such an impudent low rascal
your ladyship may be angry with me for aught i know for taking your part since proffered service they say stinks but to be sure i could never bear to hear a lady of mine called whorenor will i bear it
i am sure your ladyship is as virtuous a lady as ever sat foot on english ground and i will claw any villain's eyes out who dares for to offer to presume for to say the least word to the contrary
nobody ever could say the least ill of the character of any lady that ever i waited upon  hinc illae lachrymae in plain truth honour had as much love for her mistress as most servants have that is to saybut besides this her pride obliged her to support the character of the lady she waited on for she thought her own was in a very close manner connected with it
in proportion as the character of her mistress was raised hers likewise as she conceived was raised with it and on the contrary she thought the one could not be lowered without the other
on this subject reader i must stop a moment to tell thee a story
the famous nell gwynn stepping one day from a house where she had made a short visit into her coach saw a great mob assembled and her footman all bloody and dirty the fellow being asked by his mistress the reason of his being in that condition answered i have been fighting madam with an impudent rascal who called your ladyship a whre'
you blockhead' replied mrs gwynn at this rate you must fight every day of your life why you fool all the world knows it'
do they'
cries the fellow in a muttering voice after he had shut the coachdoor they shan't call me a whore's footman for all that
'  thus the passion of mrs honour appears natural enough even if it were to be no otherwise accounted for but in reality there was another cause of her anger for which we must beg leave to remind our reader of a circumstance mentioned in the above simile
there are indeed certain liquors which being applied to our passions or to fire produce effects the very reverse of those produced by water as they serve to kindle and inflame rather than to extinguish
among these the generous liquor called punch is one
it was not therefore without reason that the learned dr cheney used to call drinking punch pouring liquid fire down your throat
now mrs honour had unluckily poured so much of this liquid fire down her throat that the smoke of it began to ascend into her pericranium and blinded the eyes of reason which is there supposed to keep her residence while the fire itself from the stomach easily reached the heart and there inflamed the noble passion of pride
so that upon the whole we shall cease to wonder at the violent rage of the waitingwoman though at first sight we must confess the cause seems inadequate to the effect
sophia and her cousin both did all in their power to extinguish these flames which had roared so loudly all over the house
they at length prevailed or to carry the metaphor one step farther the fire having consumed all the fuel which the language affords to wit every reproachful term in it at last went out of its own accord
but though tranquillity was restored abovestairs it was not so below where my landlady highly resenting the injury done to the beauty of her husband by the fleshspades of mrs honour called aloud for revenge and justice
as to the poor man who had principally suffered in the engagement he was perfectly quiet
perhaps the blood which he lost might have cooled his anger for the enemy had not only applied her nails to his cheeks but likewise her fist to his nostrils which lamented the blow with tears of blood in great abundance
to this we may add reflections on his mistake but indeed nothing so effectually silenced his resentment as the manner in which he now discovered his error for as to the behaviour of mrs honour it had the more confirmed him in his opinion but he was now assured by a person of great figure and who was attended by a great equipage that one of the ladies was a woman of fashion and his intimate acquaintance
by the orders of this person the landlord now ascended and acquainted our fair travellers that a great gentleman below desired to do them the honour of waiting on them
sophia turned pale and trembled at this message though the reader will conclude it was too civil notwithstanding the landlord's blunder to have come from her father but fear hath the common fault of a justice of peace and is apt to conclude hastily from every slight circumstance without examining the evidence on both sides
to ease the reader's curiosity therefore rather than his apprehensions we proceed to inform him that an irish peer had arrived very late that evening at the inn in his way to london
this nobleman having sallied from his supper at the hurricane before commemorated had seen the attendant of mrs fitzpatrick and upon a short enquiry was informed that her lady with whom he was very particularly acquainted was above
this information he had no sooner received than he addressed himself to the landlord pacified him and sent him upstairs with compliments rather civiller than those which were delivered
it may perhaps be wondered at that the waitingwoman herself was not the messenger employed on this occasion but we are sorry to say she was not at present qualified for that or indeed for any other office
the rum for so the landlord chose to call the distillation from malt had basely taken the advantage of the fatigue which the poor woman had undergone and had made terrible depredations on her noble faculties at a time when they were very unable to resist the attack
we shall not describe this tragical scene too fully but we thought ourselves obliged by that historic integrity which we profess shortly to hint a matter which we would otherwise have been glad to have spared
many historians indeed for want of this integrity or of diligence to say no worse often leave the reader to find out these little circumstances in the dark and sometimes to his great confusion and perplexity
sophia was very soon eased of her causeless fright by the entry of the noble peer who was not only an intimate acquaintance of mrs fitzpatrick but in reality a very particular friend of that lady
to say truth it was by his assistance that she had been enabled to escape from her husband for this nobleman had the same gallant disposition with those renowned knights of whom we read in heroic story and had delivered many an imprisoned nymph from durance
he was indeed as bitter an enemy to the savage authority too often exercised by husbands and fathers over the young and lovely of the other sex as ever knighterrant was to the barbarous power of enchanters nay to say truth i have often suspected that those very enchanters with which romance everywhere abounds were in reality no other than the husbands of those days and matrimony itself was perhaps the enchanted castle in which the nymphs were said to be confined
this nobleman had an estate in the neighbourhood of fitzpatrick and had been for some time acquainted with the lady
no sooner therefore did he hear of her confinement than he earnestly applied himself to procure her liberty which he presently effected not by storming the castle according to the example of antient heroes but by corrupting the governor in conformity with the modern art of war in which craft is held to be preferable to valour and gold is found to be more irresistible than either lead or steel
this circumstance however as the lady did not think it material enough to relate to her friend we would not at that time impart it to the reader
we rather chose to leave him a while under a supposition that she had found or coined or by some very extraordinary perhaps supernatural means had possessed herself of the money with which she had bribed her keeper than to interrupt her narrative by giving a hint of what seemed to her of too little importance to be mentioned
the peer after a short conversation could not forbear expressing some surprize at meeting the lady in that place nor could he refrain from telling her he imagined she had been gone to bath
mrs fitzpatrick very freely answered that she had been prevented in her purpose by the arrival of a person she need not mention
in short  says she i was overtaken by my husband for i need not affect to conceal what the world knows too well already
i had the good fortune to escape in a most surprizing manner and am now going to london with this young lady who is a near relation of mine and who hath escaped from as great a tyrant as my own  his lordship concluding that this tyrant was likewise a husband made a speech full of compliments to both the ladies and as full of invectives against his own sex nor indeed did he avoid some oblique glances at the matrimonial institution itself and at the unjust powers given by it to man over the more sensible and more meritorious part of the species
he ended his oration with an offer of his protection and of his coach and six which was instantly accepted by mrs fitzpatrick and at last upon her persuasions by sophia
matters being thus adjusted his lordship took his leave and the ladies retired to rest where mrs fitzpatrick entertained her cousin with many high encomiums on the character of the noble peer and enlarged very particularly on his great fondness for his wife saying she believed he was almost the only person of high rank who was entirely constant to the marriage bed
indeed added she my dear sophy that is a very rare virtue amongst men of condition
never expect it when you marry for believe me if you do you will certainly be deceived  a gentle sigh stole from sophia at these words which perhaps contributed to form a dream of no very pleasant kind but as she never revealed this dream to any one so the reader cannot expect to see it related here
chapter ix
the morning introduced in some pretty writing
a stagecoach
the civility of chambermaids
the heroic temper of sophia
her generosity
the return to it
the departure of the company and their arrival at london with some remarks for the use of travellers
those members of society who are born to furnish the blessings of life now began to light their candles in order to pursue their daily labours for the use of those who are born to enjoy these blessings
the sturdy hind now attends the levee of his fellowlabourer the ox the cunning artificer the diligent mechanic spring from their hard mattress and now the bonny housemaid begins to repair the disordered drumroom while the riotous authors of that disorder in broken interrupted slumbers tumble and toss as if the hardness of down disquieted their repose
in simple phrase the clock had no sooner struck seven than the ladies were ready for their journey and at their desire his lordship and his equipage were prepared to attend them
and now a matter of some difficulty arose and this was how his lordship himself should be conveyed for though in stagecoaches where passengers are properly considered as so much luggage the ingenious coachman stows half a dozen with perfect ease into the place of four for well he contrives that the fat hostess or wellfed alderman may take up no more room than the slim miss or taper master it being the nature of guts when well squeezed to give way and to lie in a narrow compass yet in these vehicles which are called for distinction's sake gentlemen's coaches though they are often larger than the others this method of packing is never attempted
his lordship would have put a short end to the difficulty by very gallantly desiring to mount his horse but mrs fitzpatrick would by no means consent to it
it was therefore concluded that the abigails should by turns relieve each other on one of his lordship's horses which was presently equipped with a sidesaddle for that purpose
everything being settled at the inn the ladies discharged their former guides and sophia made a present to the landlord partly to repair the bruise which he had received under herself and partly on account of what he had suffered under the hands of her enraged waitingwoman
and now sophia first discovered a loss which gave her some uneasiness and this was of the hundredpound bankbill which her father had given her at their last meeting and which within a very inconsiderable trifle was all the treasure she was at present worth
she searched everywhere and shook and tumbled all her things to no purpose the bill was not to be found and she was at last fully persuaded that she had lost it from her pocket when she had the misfortune of tumbling from her horse in the dark lane as before recorded a fact that seemed the more probable as she now recollected some discomposure in her pockets which had happened at that time and the great difficulty with which she had drawn forth her handkerchief the very instant before her fall in order to relieve the distress of mrs fitzpatrick
misfortunes of this kind whatever inconveniencies they may be attended with are incapable of subduing a mind in which there is any strength without the assistance of avarice
sophia therefore though nothing could be worse timed than this accident at such a season immediately got the better of her concern and with her wonted serenity and cheerfulness of countenance returned to her company
his lordship conducted the ladies into the vehicle as he did likewise mrs honour who after many civilities and more dear madams at last yielded to the wellbred importunities of her sister abigail and submitted to be complimented with the first ride in the coach in which indeed she would afterwards have been contented to have pursued her whole journey had not her mistress after several fruitless intimations at length forced her to take her turn on horseback
the coach now having received its company began to move forwards attended by many servants and led by two captains who had before rode with his lordship and who would have been dismissed from the vehicle upon a much less worthy occasion than was this of accommodating two ladies
in this they acted only as gentlemen but they were ready at any time to have performed the office of a footman or indeed would have condescended lower for the honour of his lordship's company and for the convenience of his table
my landlord was so pleased with the present he had received from sophia that he rather rejoiced in than regretted his bruise or his scratches
the reader will perhaps be curious to know the quantum of this present but we cannot satisfy his curiosity
whatever it was it satisfied the landlord for his bodily hurt but he lamented he had not known before how little the lady valued her money for to be sure  says he one might have charged every article double and she would have made no cavil at the reckoning  his wife however was far from drawing this conclusion whether she really felt any injury done to her husband more than he did himself i will not say certain it is she was much less satisfied with the generosity of sophia
indeed cries she my dear the lady knows better how to dispose of her money than you imagine
she might very well think we should not put up such a business without some satisfaction and the law would have cost her an infinite deal more than this poor little matter which i wonder you would take you are always so bloodily wise quoth the husband it would have cost her more would it
dost fancy i don't know that as well as thee
but would any of that more or so much have come into our pockets
indeed if son tom the lawyer had been alive i could have been glad to have put such a pretty business into his hands
he would have got a good picking out of it but i have no relation now who is a lawyer and why should i go to law for the benefit of strangers nay to be sure answered she you must know best i believe i do replied he
i fancy when money is to be got i can smell it out as well as another
everybody let me tell you would not have talked people out of this
mind that i say everybody would not have cajoled this out of her mind that the wife then joined in the applause of her husband's sagacity and thus ended the short dialogue between them on this occasion
we will therefore take our leave of these good people and attend his lordship and his fair companions who made such good expedition that they performed a journey of ninety miles in two days and on the second evening arrived in london without having encountered any one adventure on the road worthy the dignity of this history to relate
our pen therefore shall imitate the expedition which it describes and our history shall keep pace with the travellers who are its subject
good writers will indeed do well to imitate the ingenious traveller in this instance who always proportions his stay at any place to the beauties elegancies and curiosities which it affords
at eshur at stowe at wilton at eastbury and at prior's park days are too short for the ravished imagination while we admire the wondrous power of art in improving nature
in some of these art chiefly engages our admiration in others nature and art contend for our applause but in the last the former seems to triumph
here nature appears in her richest attire and art dressed with the modestest simplicity attends her benignant mistress
here nature indeed pours forth the choicest treasures which she hath lavished on this world and here human nature presents you with an object which can be exceeded only in the other
the same taste the same imagination which luxuriously riots in these elegant scenes can be amused with objects of far inferior note
the woods the rivers the lawns of devon and of dorset attract the eye of the ingenious traveller and retard his pace which delay he afterwards compensates by swiftly scouring over the gloomy heath of bagshot or that pleasant plain which extends itself westward from stockbridge where no other object than one single tree only in sixteen miles presents itself to the view unless the clouds in compassion to our tired spirits kindly open their variegated mansions to our prospect
not so travels the moneymeditating tradesman the sagacious justice the dignified doctor the warmclad grazier with all the numerous offspring of wealth and dulness
on they jog with equal pace through the verdant meadows or over the barren heath their horses measuring four miles and a half per hour with the utmost exactness the eyes of the beast and of his master being alike directed forwards and employed in contemplating the same objects in the same manner
with equal rapture the good rider surveys the proudest boasts of the architect and those fair buildings with which some unknown name hath adorned the rich cloathing town where heaps of bricks are piled up as a kind of monument to show that heaps of money have been piled there before
and now reader as we are in haste to attend our heroine we will leave to thy sagacity to apply all this to the boeotian writers and to those authors who are their opposites
this thou wilt be abundantly able to perform without our aid
bestir thyself therefore on this occasion for though we will always lend thee proper assistance in difficult places as we do not like some others expect thee to use the arts of divination to discover our meaning yet we shall not indulge thy laziness where nothing but thy own attention is required for thou art highly mistaken if thou dost imagine that we intended when we began this great work to leave thy sagacity nothing to do or that without sometimes exercising this talent thou wilt be able to travel through our pages with any pleasure or profit to thyself
chapter x
containing a hint or two concerning virtue and a few more concerning suspicion
our company being arrived at london were set down at his lordship's house where while they refreshed themselves after the fatigue of their journey servants were despatched to provide a lodging for the two ladies for as her ladyship was not then in town mrs fitzpatrick would by no means consent to accept a bed in the mansion of the peer
some readers will perhaps condemn this extraordinary delicacy as i may call it of virtue as too nice and scrupulous but we must make allowances for her situation which must be owned to have been very ticklish and when we consider the malice of censorious tongues we must allow if it was a fault the fault was an excess on the right side and which every woman who is in the selfsame situation will do well to imitate
the most formal appearance of virtue when it is only an appearance may perhaps in very abstracted considerations seem to be rather less commendable than virtue itself without this formality but it will however be always more commended and this i believe will be granted by all that it is necessary unless in some very particular cases for every woman to support either the one or the other
a lodging being prepared sophia accompanied her cousin for that evening but resolved early in the morning to enquire after the lady into whose protection as we have formerly mentioned she had determined to throw herself when she quitted her father's house
and this she was the more eager in doing from some observations she had made during her journey in the coach
now as we would by no means fix the odious character of suspicion on sophia we are almost afraid to open to our reader the conceits which filled her mind concerning mrs fitzpatrick of whom she certainly entertained at present some doubts which as they are very apt to enter into the bosoms of the worst of people we think proper not to mention more plainly till we have first suggested a word or two to our reader touching suspicion in general
of this there have always appeared to me to be two degrees
the first of these i chuse to derive from the heart as the extreme velocity of its discernment seems to denote some previous inward impulse and the rather as this superlative degree often forms its own objects sees what is not and always more than really exists
this is that quicksighted penetration whose hawk's eyes no symptom of evil can escape which observes not only upon the actions but upon the words and looks of men and as it proceeds from the heart of the observer so it dives into the heart of the observed and there espies evil as it were in the first embryo nay sometimes before it can be said to be conceived
an admirable faculty if it were infallible but as this degree of perfection is not even claimed by more than one mortal being so from the fallibility of such acute discernment have arisen many sad mischiefs and most grievous heartaches to innocence and virtue
i cannot help therefore regarding this vast quicksightedness into evil as a vicious excess and as a very pernicious evil in itself
and i am the more inclined to this opinion as i am afraid it always proceeds from a bad heart for the reasons i have above mentioned and for one more namely because i never knew it the property of a good one
now from this degree of suspicion i entirely and absolutely acquit sophia
a second degree of this quality seems to arise from the head
this is indeed no other than the faculty of seeing what is before your eyes and of drawing conclusions from what you see
the former of these is unavoidable by those who have any eyes and the latter is perhaps no less certain and necessary a consequence of our having any brains
this is altogether as bitter an enemy to guilt as the former is to innocence nor can i see it in an unamiable light even though through human fallibility it should be sometimes mistaken
for instance if a husband should accidentally surprize his wife in the lap or in the embraces of some of those pretty young gentlemen who profess the art of cuckoldmaking i should not highly i think blame him for concluding something more than what he saw from the familiarities which he really had seen and which we are at least favourable enough to when we call them innocent freedoms
the reader will easily suggest great plenty of instances to himself i shall add but one more which however unchristian it may be thought by some i cannot help esteeming to be strictly justifiable and this is a suspicion that a man is capable of doing what he hath done already and that it is possible for one who hath been a villain once to act the same part again
and to confess the truth of this degree of suspicion i believe sophia was guilty
from this degree of suspicion she had in fact conceived an opinion that her cousin was really not better than she should be
the case it seems was this mrs fitzpatrick wisely considered that the virtue of a young lady is in the world in the same situation with a poor hare which is certain whenever it ventures abroad to meet its enemies for it can hardly meet any other
no sooner therefore was she determined to take the first opportunity of quitting the protection of her husband than she resolved to cast herself under the protection of some other man and whom could she so properly choose to be her guardian as a person of quality of fortune of honour and who besides a gallant disposition which inclines men to knighterrantry that is to be the champions of ladies in distress had often declared a violent attachment to herself and had already given her all the instances of it in his power
but as the law hath foolishly omitted this office of vicehusband or guardian to an eloped lady and as malice is apt to denominate him by a more disagreeable appellation it was concluded that his lordship should perform all such kind offices to the lady in secret and without publickly assuming the character of her protector
nay to prevent any other person from seeing him in this light it was agreed that the lady should proceed directly to bath and that his lordship should first go to london and thence should go down to that place by the advice of his physicians
now all this sophia very plainly understood not from the lips or behaviour of mrs fitzpatrick but from the peer who was infinitely less expert at retaining a secret than was the good lady and perhaps the exact secrecy which mrs fitzpatrick had observed on this head in her narrative served not a little to heighten those suspicions which were now risen in the mind of her cousin
sophia very easily found out the lady she sought for indeed there was not a chairman in town to whom her house was not perfectly well known and as she received in return of her first message a most pressing invitation she immediately accepted it
mrs fitzpatrick indeed did not desire her cousin to stay with her with more earnestness than civility required
whether she had discerned and resented the suspicion abovementioned or from what other motive it arose i cannot say but certain it is she was full as desirous of parting with sophia as sophia herself could be of going
the young lady when she came to take leave of her cousin could not avoid giving her a short hint of advice
she begged her for heaven's sake to take care of herself and to consider in how dangerous a situation she stood adding she hoped some method would be found of reconciling her to her husband
you must remember my dear says she the maxim which my aunt western hath so often repeated to us both that whenever the matrimonial alliance is broke and war declared between husband and wife she can hardly make a disadvantageous peace for herself on any conditions
these are my aunt's very words and she hath had a great deal of experience in the world mrs fitzpatrick answered with a contemptuous smile never fear me child take care of yourself for you are younger than i i will come and visit you in a few days but dear sophy let me give you one piece of advice leave the character of graveairs in the country for believe me it will sit very awkwardly upon you in this town  thus the two cousins parted and sophia repaired directly to lady bellaston where she found a most hearty as well as a most polite welcome
the lady had taken a great fancy to her when she had seen her formerly with her aunt western
she was indeed extremely glad to see her and was no sooner acquainted with the reasons which induced her to leave the squire and to fly to london than she highly applauded her sense and resolution and after expressing the highest satisfaction in the opinion which sophia had declared she entertained of her ladyship by chusing her house for an asylum she promised her all the protection which it was in her power to give
as we have now brought sophia into safe hands the reader will i apprehend be contented to deposit her there a while and to look a little after other personages and particularly poor jones whom we have left long enough to do penance for his past offences which as is the nature of vice brought sufficient punishment upon him themselves
book xii
containing the same individual time with the former
chapter i
showing what is to be deemed plagiarism in a modern author and what is to be considered as lawful prize
the learned reader must have observed that in the course of this mighty work i have often translated passages out of the best antient authors without quoting the original or without taking the least notice of the book from whence they were borrowed
this conduct in writing is placed in a very proper light by the ingenious abb bannier in his preface to his mythology a work of great erudition and of equal judgment
it will be easy says he for the reader to observe that i have frequently had greater regard to him than to my own reputation for an author certainly pays him a considerable compliment when for his sake he suppresses learned quotations that come in his way and which would have cost him but the bare trouble of transcribing  to fill up a work with these scraps may indeed be considered as a downright cheat on the learned world who are by such means imposed upon to buy a second time in fragments and by retail what they have already in gross if not in their memories upon their shelves and it is still more cruel upon the illiterate who are drawn in to pay for what is of no manner of use to them
a writer who intermixes great quantity of greek and latin with his works deals by the ladies and fine gentlemen in the same paultry manner with which they are treated by the auctioneers who often endeavour so to confound and mix up their lots that in order to purchase the commodity you want you are obliged at the same time to purchase that which will do you no service
and yet as there is no conduct so fair and disinterested but that it may be misunderstood by ignorance and misrepresented by malice i have been sometimes tempted to preserve my own reputation at the expense of my reader and to transcribe the original or at least to quote chapter and verse whenever i have made use either of the thought or expression of another
i am indeed in some doubt that i have often suffered by the contrary method and that by suppressing the original author's name i have been rather suspected of plagiarism than reputed to act from the amiable motive assigned by that justly celebrated frenchman
now to obviate all such imputations for the future i do here confess and justify the fact
the antients may be considered as a rich common where every person who hath the smallest tenement in parnassus hath a free right to fatten his muse
or to place it in a clearer light we moderns are to the antients what the poor are to the rich
by the poor here i mean that large and venerable body which in english we call the mob
now whoever hath had the honour to be admitted to any degree of intimacy with this mob must well know that it is one of their established maxims to plunder and pillage their rich neighbours without any reluctance and that this is held to be neither sin nor shame among them
and so constantly do they abide and act by this maxim that in every parish almost in the kingdom there is a kind of confederacy ever carrying on against a certain person of opulence called the squire whose property is considered as freebooty by all his poor neighbours who as they conclude that there is no manner of guilt in such depredations look upon it as a point of honour and moral obligation to conceal and to preserve each other from punishment on all such occasions
in like manner are the antients such as homer virgil horace cicero and the rest to be esteemed among us writers as so many wealthy squires from whom we the poor of parnassus claim an immemorial custom of taking whatever we can come at
this liberty i demand and this i am as ready to allow again to my poor neighbours in their turn
all i profess and all i require of my brethren is to maintain the same strict honesty among ourselves which the mob show to one another
to steal from one another is indeed highly criminal and indecent for this may be strictly stiled defrauding the poor sometimes perhaps those who are poorer than ourselves or to set it under the most opprobrious colours robbing the spittal
since therefore upon the strictest examination my own conscience cannot lay any such pitiful theft to my charge i am contented to plead guilty to the former accusation nor shall i ever scruple to take to myself any passage which i shall find in an antient author to my purpose without setting down the name of the author from whence it was taken
nay i absolutely claim a property in all such sentiments the moment they are transcribed into my writings and i expect all readers henceforwards to regard them as purely and entirely my own
this claim however i desire to be allowed me only on condition that i preserve strict honesty towards my poor brethren from whom if ever i borrow any of that little of which they are possessed i shall never fail to put their mark upon it that it may be at all times ready to be restored to the right owner
the omission of this was highly blameable in one mr moore who having formerly borrowed some lines of pope and company took the liberty to transcribe six of them into his play of the rival modes
mr pope however very luckily found them in the said play and laying violent hands on his own property transferred it back again into his own works and for a further punishment imprisoned the said moore in the loathsome dungeon of the dunciad where his unhappy memory now remains and eternally will remain as a proper punishment for such his unjust dealings in the poetical trade
chapter ii
in which though the squire doth not find his daughter something is found which puts an end to his pursuit
the history now returns to the inn at upton whence we shall first trace the footsteps of squire western for as he will soon arrive at an end of his journey we shall have then full leisure to attend our heroe
the reader may be pleased to remember that the said squire departed from the inn in great fury and in that fury he pursued his daughter
the hostler having informed him that she had crossed the severn he likewise past that river with his equipage and rode full speed vowing the utmost vengeance against poor sophia if he should but overtake her
he had not gone far before he arrived at a crossway
here he called a short council of war in which after hearing different opinions he at last gave the direction of his pursuit to fortune and struck directly into the worcester road
in this road he proceeded about two miles when he began to bemoan himself most bitterly frequently crying out what pity is it
sure never was so unlucky a dog as myself and then burst forth a volley of oaths and execrations
the parson attempted to administer comfort to him on this occasion
sorrow not sir says he like those without hope
howbeit we have not yet been able to overtake young madam we may account it some good fortune that we have hitherto traced her course aright
peradventure she will soon be fatigated with her journey and will tarry in some inn in order to renovate her corporeal functions and in that case in all moral certainty you will very briefly be compos voti  pogh
dn the slut answered the squire i am lamenting the loss of so fine a morning for hunting
it is confounded hard to lose one of the best scenting days in all appearance which hath been this season and especially after so long a frost  whether fortune who now and then shows some compassion in her wantonest tricks might not take pity of the squire and as she had determined not to let him overtake his daughter might not resolve to make him amends some other way i will not assert but he had hardly uttered the words just before commemorated and two or three oaths at their heels when a pack of hounds began to open their melodious throats at a small distance from them which the squire's horse and his rider both perceiving both immediately pricked up their ears and the squire crying she's gone she's gone
damn me if she is not gone instantly clapped spurs to the beast who little needed it having indeed the same inclination with his master and now the whole company crossing into a cornfield rode directly towards the hounds with much hallowing and whooping while the poor parson blessing himself brought up the rear
thus fable reports that the fair grimalkin whom venus at the desire of a passionate lover converted from a cat into a fine woman no sooner perceived a mouse than mindful of her former sport and still retaining her pristine nature she leaped from the bed of her husband to pursue the little animal
what are we to understand by this
not that the bride was displeased with the embraces of her amorous bridegroom for though some have remarked that cats are subject to ingratitude yet women and cats too will be pleased and purr on certain occasions
the truth is as the sagacious sir roger l'estrange observes in his deep reflections that if we shut nature out at the door she will come in at the window and that puss though a madam will be a mouser still in the same manner we are not to arraign the squire of any want of love for his daughter for in reality he had a great deal we are only to consider that he was a squire and a sportsman and then we may apply the fable to him and the judicious reflections likewise
the hounds ran very hard as it is called and the squire pursued over hedge and ditch with all his usual vociferation and alacrity and with all his usual pleasure nor did the thoughts of sophia ever once intrude themselves to allay the satisfaction he enjoyed in the chace which he said was one of the finest he ever saw and which he swore was very well worth going fifty miles for
as the squire forgot his daughter the servants we may easily believe forgot their mistress and the parson after having expressed much astonishment in latin to himself at length likewise abandoned all farther thoughts of the young lady and jogging on at a distance behind began to meditate a portion of doctrine for the ensuing sunday
the squire who owned the hounds was highly pleased with the arrival of his brother squire and sportsman for all men approve merit in their own way and no man was more expert in the field than mr western nor did any other better know how to encourage the dogs with his voice and to animate the hunt with his holla
sportsmen in the warmth of a chace are too much engaged to attend to any manner of ceremony nay even to the offices of humanity for if any of them meet with an accident by tumbling into a ditch or into a river the rest pass on regardless and generally leave him to his fate during this time therefore the two squires though often close to each other interchanged not a single word
the master of the hunt however often saw and approved the great judgment of the stranger in drawing the dogs when they were at a fault and hence conceived a very high opinion of his understanding as the number of his attendants inspired no small reverence to his quality
as soon therefore as the sport was ended by the death of the little animal which had occasioned it the two squires met and in all squirelike greeting saluted each other
the conversation was entertaining enough and what we may perhaps relate in an appendix or on some other occasion but as it nowise concerns this history we cannot prevail on ourselves to give it a place here
it concluded with a second chace and that with an invitation to dinner
this being accepted was followed by a hearty bout of drinking which ended in as hearty a nap on the part of squire western
our squire was by no means a match either for his host or for parson supple at his cups that evening for which the violent fatigue of mind as well as body that he had undergone may very well account without the least derogation from his honour
he was indeed according to the vulgar phrase whistle drunk for before he had swallowed the third bottle he became so entirely overpowered that though he was not carried off to bed till long after the parson considered him as absent and having acquainted the other squire with all relating to sophia he obtained his promise of seconding those arguments which he intended to urge the next morning for mr western's return
no sooner therefore had the good squire shaken off his evening and began to call for his morning draught and to summon his horses in order to renew his pursuit than mr supple began his dissuasives which the host so strongly seconded that they at length prevailed and mr western agreed to return home being principally moved by one argument viz that he knew not which way to go and might probably be riding farther from his daughter instead of towards her
he then took leave of his brother sportsman and expressing great joy that the frost was broken which might perhaps be no small motive to his hastening home set forwards or rather backwards for somersetshire but not before he had first despatched part of his retinue in quest of his daughter after whom he likewise sent a volley of the most bitter execrations which he could invent
chapter iii
the departure of jones from upton with what passed between him and partridge on the road
at length we are once more come to our heroe and to say truth we have been obliged to part with him so long that considering the condition in which we left him i apprehend many of our readers have concluded we intended to abandon him for ever he being at present in that situation in which prudent people usually desist from enquiring any farther after their friends lest they should be shocked by hearing such friends had hanged themselves
but in reality if we have not all the virtues i will boldly say neither have we all the vices of a prudent character and though it is not easy to conceive circumstances much more miserable than those of poor jones at present we shall return to him and attend upon him with the same diligence as if he was wantoning in the brightest beams of fortune
mr jones then and his companion partridge left the inn a few minutes after the departure of squire western and pursued the same road on foot for the hostler told them that no horses were by any means to be at that time procured at upton
on they marched with heavy hearts for though their disquiet proceeded from very different reasons yet displeased they were both and if jones sighed bitterly partridge grunted altogether as sadly at every step
when they came to the crossroads where the squire had stopt to take counsel jones stopt likewise and turning to partridge asked his opinion which track they should pursue
ah sir answered partridge i wish your honour would follow my advice why should i not  replied jones for it is now indifferent to me whither i go or what becomes of me my advice then said partridge is that you immediately face about and return home for who that hath such a home to return to as your honour would travel thus about the country like a vagabond
i ask pardon sed vox ea sola reperta est  alas cries jones i have no home to return tobut if my friend my father would receive me could i bear the country from which sophia is flown
cruel sophia
cruel
no let me blame myselfno let me blame thee
dnation seize theefoolblockhead
thou hast undone me and i will tear thy soul from thy bodyat which words he laid violent hands on the collar of poor partridge and shook him more heartily than an aguefit or his own fears had ever done before
partridge fell trembling on his knees and begged for mercy vowing he had meant no harmwhen jones after staring wildly on him for a moment quitted his hold and discharged a rage on himself that had it fallen on the other would certainly have put an end to his being which indeed the very apprehension of it had almost effected
we would bestow some pains here in minutely describing all the mad pranks which jones played on this occasion could we be well assured that the reader would take the same pains in perusing them but as we are apprehensive that after all the labour which we should employ in painting this scene the said reader would be very apt to skip it entirely over we have saved ourselves that trouble
to say the truth we have from this reason alone often done great violence to the luxuriance of our genius and have left many excellent descriptions out of our work which would otherwise have been in it
and this suspicion to be honest arises as is generally the case from our own wicked heart for we have ourselves been very often most horridly given to jumping as we have run through the pages of voluminous historians
suffice it then simply to say that jones after having played the part of a madman for many minutes came by degrees to himself which no sooner happened than turning to partridge he very earnestly begged his pardon for the attack he had made on him in the violence of his passion but concluded by desiring him never to mention his return again for he was resolved never to see that country any more
partridge easily forgave and faithfully promised to obey the injunction now laid upon him
and then jones very briskly cried out since it is absolutely impossible for me to pursue any farther the steps of my angeli will pursue those of glory
come on my brave lad now for the armyit is a glorious cause and i would willingly sacrifice my life in it even though it was worth my preserving and so saying he immediately struck into the different road from that which the squire had taken and by mere chance pursued the very same through which sophia had before passed
our travellers now marched a full mile without speaking a syllable to each other though jones indeed muttered many things to himself
as to partridge he was profoundly silent for he was not perhaps perfectly recovered from his former fright besides he had apprehensions of provoking his friend to a second fit of wrath especially as he now began to entertain a conceit which may not perhaps create any great wonder in the reader
in short he began now to suspect that jones was absolutely out of his senses
at length jones being weary of soliloquy addressed himself to his companion and blamed him for his taciturnity for which the poor man very honestly accounted from his fear of giving offence
and now this fear being pretty well removed by the most absolute promises of indemnity partridge again took the bridle from his tongue which perhaps rejoiced no less at regaining its liberty than a young colt when the bridle is slipt from his neck and he is turned loose into the pastures
as partridge was inhibited from that topic which would have first suggested itself he fell upon that which was next uppermost in his mind namely the man of the hill
certainly sir says he that could never be a man who dresses himself and lives after such a strange manner and so unlike other folks
besides his diet as the old woman told me is chiefly upon herbs which is a fitter food for a horse than a christian nay landlord at upton says that the neighbours thereabouts have very fearful notions about him
it runs strangely in my head that it must have been some spirit who perhaps might be sent to forewarn us and who knows but all that matter which he told us of his going to fight and of his being taken prisoner and of the great danger he was in of being hanged might be intended as a warning to us considering what we are going about
besides i dreamt of nothing all last night but of fighting and methought the blood ran out of my nose as liquor out of a tap
indeed sir infandum regina jubes renovare dolorem  thy story partridge answered jones is almost as ill applied as thy latin
nothing can be more likely to happen than death to men who go into battle
perhaps we shall both fall in itand what then  what then replied partridge why then there is an end of us is there not
when i am gone all is over with me
what matters the cause to me or who gets the victory if i am killed
i shall never enjoy any advantage from it
what are all the ringing of bells and bonfires to one that is six foot under ground
there will be an end of poor partridge and an end of poor partridge cries jones there must be one time or other
if you love latin i will repeat you some fine lines out of horace which would inspire courage into a coward
dulce et decorum est pro patria mori      mors et fugacem persequitur virum      nec parcit imbellis juventae      poplitibus timidoque tergo'  i wish you would construe them cries partridge for horace is a hard author and i cannot understand as you repeat them  i will repeat you a bad imitation or rather paraphrase of my own  said jones for i am but an indifferent poet  who would not die in his dear country's cause
since if base fear his dastard step withdraws from death he cannot flyone common grave receives at last the coward and the brave
'  that's very certain cries partridge
ay sure mors omnibus communis but there is a great difference between dying in one's bed a great many years hence like a good christian with all our friends crying about us and being shot today or tomorrow like a mad dog or perhaps hacked in twenty pieces with the sword and that too before we have repented of all our sins
o lord have mercy upon us
to be sure the soldiers are a wicked kind of people
i never loved to have anything to do with them
i could hardly bring myself ever to look upon them as christians
there is nothing but cursing and swearing among them
i wish your honour would repent i heartily wish you would repent before it is too late and not think of going among themevil communication corrupts good manners
that is my principal reason
for as for that matter i am no more afraid than another man not i as to matter of that
i know all human flesh must die but yet a man may live many years for all that
why i am a middleaged man now and yet i may live a great number of years
i have read of several who have lived to be above a hundred and some a great deal above a hundred
not that i hope i mean that i promise myself to live to any such age as that neitherbut if it be only to eighty or ninety
heaven be praised that is a great ways off yet and i am not afraid of dying then no more than another man but surely to tempt death before a man's time is come seems to me downright wickedness and presumption
besides if it was to do any good indeed but let the cause be what it will what mighty matter of good can two people do
and for my part i understand nothing of it
i never fired off a gun above ten times in my life and then it was not charged with bullets
and for the sword i never learned to fence and know nothing of the matter
and then there are those cannons which certainly it must be thought the highest presumption to go in the way of and nobody but a madmani ask pardon upon my soul i meant no harm i beg i may not throw your honour into another passion  be under no apprehension partridge cries jones i am now so well convinced of thy cowardice that thou couldst not provoke me on any account your honour answered he may call me coward or anything else you please
if loving to sleep in a whole skin makes a man a coward non immunes ab illis malis sumus
i never read in my grammar that a man can't be a good man without fighting
vir bonus est quis
qui consulta patrum qui leges juraque servat
not a word of fighting and i am sure the scripture is so much against it that a man shall never persuade me he is a good christian while he sheds christian blood    chapter iv
the adventure of a beggarman
just as partridge had uttered that good and pious doctrine with which the last chapter concluded they arrived at another crossway when a lame fellow in rags asked them for alms upon which partridge gave him a severe rebuke saying every parish ought to keep their own poor  jones then fell alaughing and asked partridge if he was not ashamed with so much charity in his mouth to have no charity in his heart
your religion says he serves you only for an excuse for your faults but is no incentive to your virtue
can any man who is really a christian abstain from relieving one of his brethren in such a miserable condition and at the same time putting his hand in his pocket he gave the poor object a shilling
master cries the fellow after thanking him i have a curious thing here in my pocket which i found about two miles off if your worship will please to buy it
i should not venture to pull it out to every one but as you are so good a gentleman and so kind to the poor you won't suspect a man of being a thief only because he is poor he then pulled out a little gilt pocketbook and delivered it into the hands of jones
jones presently opened it and guess reader what he felt saw in the first page the words sophia western written by her own fair hand
he no sooner read the name than he prest it close to his lips nor could he avoid falling into some very frantic raptures notwithstanding his company but perhaps these very raptures made him forget he was not alone
while jones was kissing and mumbling the book as if he had an excellent brown buttered crust in his mouth or as if he had really been a bookworm or an author who had nothing to eat but his own works a piece of paper fell from its leaves to the ground which partridge took up and delivered to jones who presently perceived it to be a bankbill
it was indeed the very bill which western had given his daughter the night before her departure and a jew would have jumped to purchase it at five shillings less than 
the eyes of partridge sparkled at this news which jones now proclaimed aloud and so did though with somewhat a different aspect those of the poor fellow who had found the book and who i hope from a principle of honesty had never opened it but we should not deal honestly by the reader if we omitted to inform him of a circumstance which may be here a little material viz
that the fellow could not read
jones who had felt nothing but pure joy and transport from the finding the book was affected with a mixture of concern at this new discovery for his imagination instantly suggested to him that the owner of the bill might possibly want it before he should be able to convey it to her
he then acquainted the finder that he knew the lady to whom the book belonged and would endeavour to find her out as soon as possible and return it her
the pocketbook was a late present from mrs western to her niece it had cost fiveandtwenty shillings having been bought of a celebrated toyman but the real value of the silver which it contained in its clasp was about eighteenpence and that price the said toyman as it was altogether as good as when it first issued from his shop would now have given for it
a prudent person would however have taken proper advantage of the ignorance of this fellow and would not have offered more than a shilling or perhaps sixpence for it nay some perhaps would have given nothing and left the fellow to his action of trover which some learned serjeants may doubt whether he could under these circumstances have maintained
jones on the contrary whose character was on the outside of generosity and may perhaps not very unjustly have been suspected of extravagance without any hesitation gave a guinea in exchange for the book
the poor man who had not for a long time before been possessed of so much treasure gave mr jones a thousand thanks and discovered little less of transport in his muscles than jones had before shown when he had first read the name of sophia western
the fellow very readily agreed to attend our travellers to the place where he had found the pocketbook
together therefore they proceeded directly thither but not so fast as mr jones desired for his guide unfortunately happened to be lame and could not possibly travel faster than a mile an hour
as this place therefore was at above three miles' distance though the fellow had said otherwise the reader need not be acquainted how long they were in walking it
jones opened the book a hundred times during their walk kissed it as often talked much to himself and very little to his companions
at all which the guide exprest some signs of astonishment to partridge who more than once shook his head and cryed poor gentleman
orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano  at length they arrived at the very spot where sophia unhappily dropt the pocketbook and where the fellow had as happily found it
here jones offered to take leave of his guide and to improve his pace but the fellow in whom that violent surprize and joy which the first receipt of the guinea had occasioned was now considerably abated and who had now had sufficient time to recollect himself put on a discontented look and scratching his head said he hoped his worship would give him something more
your worship said he will i hope take it into your consideration that if i had not been honest i might have kept the whole and indeed this the reader must confess to have been true
if the paper there said he be worth  i am sure the finding it deserves more than a guinea
besides suppose your worship should never see the lady nor give it herand though your worship looks and talks very much like a gentleman yet i have only your worship's bare word and certainly if the right owner ben't to be found it all belongs to the first finder
i hope your worship will consider of all these matters i am but a poor man and therefore don't desire to have all but it is but reasonable i should have my share
your worship looks like a good man and i hope will consider my honesty for i might have kept every farthing and nobody ever the wiser i promise thee upon my honour cries jones that i know the right owner and will restore it her nay your worship  answered the fellow may do as you please as to that if you will but give me my share that is onehalf of the money your honour may keep the rest yourself if you please and concluded with swearing by a very vehement oath that he would never mention a syllable of it to any man living  lookee friend cries jones the right owner shall certainly have again all that she lost and as for any farther gratuity i really cannot give it you at present but let me know your name and where you live and it is more than possible you may hereafter have further reason to rejoice at this morning's adventure  i don't know what you mean by venture cries the fellow it seems i must venture whether you will return the lady her money or no but i hope your worship will consider come come said partridge tell his honour your name and where you may be found i warrant you will never repent having put the money into his hands the fellow seeing no hopes of recovering the possession of the pocketbook at last complied in giving in his name and place of abode which jones writ upon a piece of paper with the pencil of sophia and then placing the paper in the same page where she had writ her name he cried out there friend you are the happiest man alive i have joined your name to that of an angel i don't know anything about angels  answered the fellow but i wish you would give me a little more money or else return me the pocketbook partridge now waxed wrath he called the poor cripple by several vile and opprobrious names and was absolutely proceeding to beat him but jones would not suffer any such thing and now telling the fellow he would certainly find some opportunity of serving him mr jones departed as fast as his heels would carry him and partridge into whom the thoughts of the hundred pound had infused new spirits followed his leader while the man who was obliged to stay behind fell to cursing them both as well as his parents for had they says he sent me to charityschool to learn to write and read and cast accounts i should have known the value of these matters as well as other people    chapter v  containing more adventures which mr jones and his companion met on the road
our travellers now walked so fast that they had very little time or breath for conversation jones meditating all the way on sophia and partridge on the bankbill which though it gave him some pleasure caused him at the same time to repine at fortune which in all his walks had never given him such an opportunity of showing his honesty
they had proceeded above three miles when partridge being unable any longer to keep up with jones called to him and begged him a little to slacken his pace with this he was the more ready to comply as he had for some time lost the footsteps of the horses which the thaw had enabled him to trace for several miles and he was now upon a wide common where were several roads
he here therefore stopt to consider which of these roads he should pursue when on a sudden they heard the noise of a drum that seemed at no great distance
this sound presently alarmed the fears of partridge and he cried out lord have mercy upon us all they are certainly a coming who is coming cries jones for fear had long since given place to softer ideas in his mind and since his adventure with the lame man he had been totally intent on pursuing sophia without entertaining one thought of an enemy
who cries partridge why the rebels but why should i call them rebels
they may be very honest gentlemen for anything i know to the contrary
the devil take him that affronts them i say i am sure if they have nothing to say to me i will have nothing to say to them but in a civil way
for heaven's sake sir don't affront them if they should come and perhaps they may do us no harm but would it not be the wiser way to creep into some of yonder bushes till they are gone by
what can two unarmed men do perhaps against fifty thousand
certainly nobody but a madman i hope your honour is not offended but certainly no man who hath mens sana in corpore sano here jones interrupted this torrent of eloquence which fear had inspired saying that by the drum he perceived they were near some town he then made directly towards the place whence the noise proceeded bidding partridge take courage for that he would lead him into no danger and adding it was impossible the rebels should be so near  partridge was a little comforted with this last assurance and though he would more gladly have gone the contrary way he followed his leader his heart beating time but not after the manner of heroes to the music of the drum which ceased not till they had traversed the common and were come into a narrow lane
and now partridge who kept even pace with jones discovered something painted flying in the air a very few yards before him which fancying to be the colours of the enemy he fell a bellowing oh lord sir here they are there is the crown and coffin
oh lord
i never saw anything so terrible and we are within gunshot of them already  jones no sooner looked up than he plainly perceived what it was which partridge had thus mistaken
partridge says he i fancy you will be able to engage this whole army yourself for by the colours i guess what the drum was which we heard before and which beats up for recruits to a puppetshow  a puppetshow answered partridge with most eager transport
and is it really no more than that
i love a puppetshow of all the pastimes upon earth
do good sir let us tarry and see it
besides i am quite famished to death for it is now almost dark and i have not eat a morsel since three o'clock in the morning  they now arrived at an inn or indeed an alehouse where jones was prevailed upon to stop the rather as he had no longer any assurance of being in the road he desired
they walked both directly into the kitchen where jones began to enquire if no ladies had passed that way in the morning and partridge as eagerly examined into the state of their provisions and indeed his enquiry met with the better success for jones could not hear news of sophia but partridge to his great satisfaction found good reason to expect very shortly the agreeable sight of an excellent smoaking dish of eggs and bacon
in strong and healthy constitutions love hath a very different effect from what it causes in the puny part of the species
in the latter it generally destroys all that appetite which tends towards the conservation of the individual but in the former though it often induces forgetfulness and a neglect of food as well as of everything else yet place a good piece of wellpowdered buttock before a hungry lover and he seldom fails very handsomely to play his part
thus it happened in the present case for though jones perhaps wanted a prompter and might have travelled much farther had he been alone with an empty stomach yet no sooner did he sit down to the bacon and eggs than he fell to as heartily and voraciously as partridge himself
before our travellers had finished their dinner night came on and as the moon was now past the full it was extremely dark
partridge therefore prevailed on jones to stay and see the puppetshow which was just going to begin and to which they were very eagerly invited by the master of the said show who declared that his figures were the finest which the world had ever produced and that they had given great satisfaction to all the quality in every town in england
the puppetshow was performed with great regularity and decency
it was called the fine and serious part of the provoked husband and it was indeed a very grave and solemn entertainment without any low wit or humour or jests or to do it no more than justice without anything which could provoke a laugh
the audience were all highly pleased
a grave matron told the master she would bring her two daughters the next night as he did not show any stuff and an attorney's clerk and an exciseman both declared that the characters of lord and lady townley were well preserved and highly in nature
partridge likewise concurred with this opinion
the master was so highly elated with these encomiums that he could not refrain from adding some more of his own
he said the present age was not improved in anything so much as in their puppetshows which by throwing out punch and his wife joan and such idle trumpery were at last brought to be a rational entertainment
i remember said he when i first took to the business there was a great deal of low stuff that did very well to make folks laugh but was never calculated to improve the morals of young people which certainly ought to be principally aimed at in every puppetshow for why may not good and instructive lessons be conveyed this way as well as any other
my figures are as big as the life and they represent the life in every particular and i question not but people rise from my little drama as much improved as they do from the great i would by no means degrade the ingenuity of your profession answered jones but i should have been glad to have seen my old acquaintance master punch for all that and so far from improving i think by leaving out him and his merry wife joan you have spoiled your puppetshow  the dancer of wires conceived an immediate and high contempt for jones from these words
and with much disdain in his countenance he replied very probably sir that may be your opinion but i have the satisfaction to know the best judges differ from you and it is impossible to please every taste
i confess indeed some of the quality at bath two or three years ago wanted mightily to bring punch again upon the stage
i believe i lost some money for not agreeing to it but let others do as they will a little matter shall never bribe me to degrade my own profession nor will i ever willingly consent to the spoiling the decency and regularity of my stage by introducing any such low stuff upon it  right friend cries the clerk you are very right
always avoid what is low
there are several of my acquaintance in london who are resolved to drive everything which is low from the stage nothing can be more proper cries the exciseman pulling his pipe from his mouth
i remember added he for i then lived with my lord i was in the footman's gallery the night when this play of the provoked husband was acted first
there was a great deal of low stuff in it about a country gentleman come up to town to stand for parliamentman and there they brought a parcel of his servants upon the stage his coachman i remember particularly but the gentlemen in our gallery could not bear anything so low and they damned it
i observe friend you have left all that matter out and you are to be commended for it  nay gentlemen cries jones i can never maintain my opinion against so many indeed if the generality of his audience dislike him the learned gentleman who conducts the show might have done very right in dismissing punch from his service  the master of the show then began a second harangue and said much of the great force of example and how much the inferior part of mankind would be deterred from vice by observing how odious it was in their superiors when he was unluckily interrupted by an incident which though perhaps we might have omitted it at another time we cannot help relating at present but not in this chapter
chapter vi
from which it may be inferred that the best things are liable to be misunderstood and misinterpreted
a violent uproar now arose in the entry where my landlady was well cuffing her maid both with her fist and tongue
she had indeed missed the wench from her employment and after a little search had found her on the puppetshow stage in company with the merry andrew and in a situation not very proper to be described
though grace for that was her name had forfeited all title to modesty yet had she not impudence enough to deny a fact in which she was actually surprized she therefore took another turn and attempted to mitigate the offence
why do you beat me in this manner mistress cries the wench
if you don't like my doings you may turn me away
if i am a we for the other had liberally bestowed that appellation on her my betters are so as well as i
what was the fine lady in the puppetshow just now
i suppose she did not lie all night out from her husband for nothing  the landlady now burst into the kitchen and fell foul on both her husband and the poor puppetmover
here husband says she you see the consequence of harbouring these people in your house
if one doth draw a little drink the more for them one is hardly made amends for the litter they make and then to have one's house made a bawdyhouse of by such lousy vermin
in short i desire you would be gone tomorrow morning for i will tolerate no more such doings
it is only the way to teach our servants idleness and nonsense for to be sure nothing better can be learned by such idle shows as these
i remember when puppetshows were made of good scripture stories as jephthah's rash vow and such good things and when wicked people were carried away by the devil
there was some sense in those matters but as the parson told us last sunday nobody believes in the devil nowadays and here you bring about a parcel of puppets drest up like lords and ladies only to turn the heads of poor country wenches and when their heads are once turned topsyturvy no wonder everything else is so  virgil i think tells us that when the mob are assembled in a riotous and tumultuous manner and all sorts of missile weapons fly about if a man of gravity and authority appears amongst them the tumult is presently appeased and the mob which when collected into one body may be well compared to an ass erect their long ears at the grave man's discourse
on the contrary when a set of grave men and philosophers are disputing when wisdom herself may in a manner be considered as present and administering arguments to the disputants should a tumult arise among the mob or should one scold who is herself equal in noise to a mighty mob appear among the said philosophers their disputes cease in a moment wisdom no longer performs her ministerial office and the attention of every one is immediately attracted by the scold alone
thus the uproar aforesaid and the arrival of the landlady silenced the master of the puppetshow and put a speedy and final end to that grave and solemn harangue of which we have given the reader a sufficient taste already
nothing indeed could have happened so very inopportune as this accident the most wanton malice of fortune could not have contrived such another stratagem to confound the poor fellow while he was so triumphantly descanting on the good morals inculcated by his exhibitions
his mouth was now as effectually stopt as that of quack must be if in the midst of a declamation on the great virtues of his pills and powders the corpse of one of his martyrs should be brought forth and deposited before the stage as a testimony of his skill
instead therefore of answering my landlady the puppetshow man ran out to punish his merry andrew and now the moon beginning to put forth her silver light as the poets call it though she looked at that time more like a piece of copper jones called for his reckoning and ordered partridge whom my landlady had just awaked from a profound nap to prepare for his journey but partridge having lately carried two points as my reader hath seen before was emboldened to attempt a third which was to prevail with jones to take up a lodging that evening in the house where he then was
he introduced this with an affected surprize at the intention which mr jones declared of removing and after urging many excellent arguments against it he at last insisted strongly that it could be to no manner of purpose whatever for that unless jones knew which way the lady was gone every step he took might very possibly lead him the farther from her for you find sir said he by all the people in the house that she is not gone this way
how much better therefore would it be to stay till the morning when we may expect to meet with somebody to enquire of  this last argument had indeed some effect on jones and while he was weighing it the landlord threw all the rhetoric of which he was master into the same scale
sure sir said he your servant gives you most excellent advice for who would travel by night at this time of the year he then began in the usual stile to trumpet forth the excellent accommodation which his house afforded and my landlady likewise opened on the occasionbut not to detain the reader with what is common to every host and hostess it is sufficient to tell him jones was at last prevailed on to stay and refresh himself with a few hours' rest which indeed he very much wanted for he had hardly shut his eyes since he had left the inn where the accident of the broken head had happened
as soon as jones had taken a resolution to proceed no farther that night he presently retired to rest with his two bedfellows the pocketbook and the muff but partridge who at several times had refreshed himself with several naps was more inclined to eating than to sleeping and more to drinking than to either
and now the storm which grace had raised being at an end and my landlady being again reconciled to the puppetman who on his side forgave the indecent reflections which the good woman in her passion had cast on his performances a face of perfect peace and tranquillity reigned in the kitchen where sat assembled round the fire the landlord and landlady of the house the master of the puppetshow the attorney's clerk the exciseman and the ingenious mr partridge in which company past the agreeable conversation which will be found in the next chapter
chapter vii
containing a remark or two of our own and many more of the good company assembled in the kitchen
though the pride of partridge did not submit to acknowledge himself a servant yet he condescended in most particulars to imitate the manners of that rank
one instance of this was his greatly magnifying the fortune of his companion as he called jones such is a general custom with all servants among strangers as none of them would willingly be thought the attendant on a beggar for the higher the situation of the master is the higher consequently is that of the man in his own opinion the truth of which observation appears from the behaviour of all the footmen of the nobility
but though title and fortune communicate a splendor all around them and the footmen of men of quality and of estate think themselves entitled to a part of that respect which is paid to the quality and estate of their masters it is clearly otherwise with regard to virtue and understanding
these advantages are strictly personal and swallow themselves all the respect which is paid to them
to say the truth this is so very little that they cannot well afford to let any others partake with them
as these therefore reflect no honour on the domestic so neither is he at all dishonoured by the most deplorable want of both in his master
indeed it is otherwise in the want of what is called virtue in a mistress the consequence of which we have before seen for in this dishonour there is a kind of contagion which like that of poverty communicates itself to all who approach it
now for these reasons we are not to wonder that servants i mean among the men only should have so great regard for the reputation of the wealth of their masters and little or none at all for their character in other points and that though they would be ashamed to be the footman of a beggar they are not so to attend upon a rogue or a blockhead and do consequently make no scruple to spread the fame of the iniquities and follies of their said masters as far as possible and this often with great humour and merriment
in reality a footman is often a wit as well as a beau at the expence of the gentleman whose livery he wears
after partridge therefore had enlarged greatly on the vast fortune to which mr jones was heir he very freely communicated an apprehension which he had begun to conceive the day before and for which as we hinted at that very time the behaviour of jones seemed to have furnished a sufficient foundation
in short he was now pretty well confirmed in an opinion that his master was out of his wits with which opinion he very bluntly acquainted the good company round the fire
with this sentiment the puppetshow man immediately coincided
i own said he the gentleman surprized me very much when he talked so absurdly about puppetshows
it is indeed hardly to be conceived that any man in his senses should be so much mistaken what you say now accounts very well for all his monstrous notions
poor gentleman
i am heartily concerned for him indeed he hath a strange wildness about his eyes which i took notice of before though i did not mention it  the landlord agreed with this last assertion and likewise claimed the sagacity of having observed it
and certainly added he it must be so for no one but a madman would have thought of leaving so good a house to ramble about the country at that time of night  the exciseman pulling his pipe from his mouth said he thought the gentleman looked and talked a little wildly and then turning to partridge if he be a madman says he he should not be suffered to travel thus about the country for possibly he may do some mischief
it is a pity he was not secured and sent home to his relations  now some conceits of this kind were likewise lurking in the mind of partridge for as he was now persuaded that jones had run away from mr allworthy he promised himself the highest rewards if he could by any means convey him back
but fear of jones of whose fierceness and strength he had seen and indeed felt some instances had however represented any such scheme as impossible to be executed and had discouraged him from applying himself to form any regular plan for the purpose
but no sooner did he hear the sentiments of the exciseman than he embraced that opportunity of declaring his own and expressed a hearty wish that such a matter could be brought about
could be brought about says the exciseman why there is nothing easier  ah
sir answered partridge you don't know what a devil of a fellow he is
he can take me up with one hand and throw me out at window and he would too if he did but imagine  pogh says the exciseman i believe i am as good a man as he
besides here are five of us  i don't know what five cries the landlady my husband shall have nothing to do in it
nor shall any violent hands be laid upon anybody in my house
the young gentleman is as pretty a young gentleman as ever i saw in my life and i believe he is no more mad than any of us
what do you tell of his having a wild look with his eyes
they are the prettiest eyes i ever saw and he hath the prettiest look with them and a very modest civil young man he is
i am sure i have bepitied him heartily ever since the gentleman there in the corner told us he was crost in love
certainly that is enough to make any man especially such a sweet young gentleman as he is to look a little otherwise than he did before
lady indeed
what the devil would the lady have better than such a handsome man with a great estate
i suppose she is one of your quality folks one of your townly ladies that we saw last night in the puppetshow who don't know what they would be at  the attorney's clerk likewise declared he would have no concern in the business without the advice of counsel
suppose says he an action of false imprisonment should be brought against us what defence could we make
who knows what may be sufficient evidence of madness to a jury
but i only speak upon my own account for it don't look well for a lawyer to be concerned in these matters unless it be as a lawyer
juries are always less favourable to us than to other people
i don't therefore dissuade you mr thomson to the exciseman nor the gentleman nor anybody else  the exciseman shook his head at this speech and the puppetshow man said madness was sometimes a difficult matter for a jury to decide for i remember says he i was once present at a tryal of madness where twenty witnesses swore that the person was as mad as a march hare and twenty others that he was as much in his senses as any man in englandand indeed it was the opinion of most people that it was only a trick of his relations to rob the poor man of his right  very likely cries the landlady
i myself knew a poor gentleman who was kept in a madhouse all his life by his family and they enjoyed his estate but it did them no good for though the law gave it them it was the right of another  pogh cries the clerk with great contempt who hath any right but what the law gives them
if the law gave me the best estate in the country i should never trouble myself much who had the right  if it be so says partridge felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum  my landlord who had been called out by the arrival of a horseman at the gate now returned into the kitchen and with an affrighted countenance cried out what do you think gentlemen
the rebels have given the duke the slip and are got almost to london
it is certainly true for a man on horseback just now told me so  i am glad of it with all my heart cries partridge then there will be no fighting in these parts  i am glad cries the clerk for a better reason for i would always have right take place  ay but answered the landlord i have heard some people say this man hath no right  i will prove the contrary in a moment cries the clerk if my father dies seized of a right do you mind me seized of a right i say doth not that right descend to his son and doth not one right descend as well as another  but how can he have any right to make us papishes says the landlord
never fear that cries partridge
as to the matter of right the gentleman there hath proved it as clear as the sun and as to the matter of religion it is quite out of the case
the papists themselves don't expect any such thing
a popish priest whom i know very well and who is a very honest man told me upon his word and honour they had no such design  and another priest of my acquaintance said the landlady hath told me the same thing but my husband is always so afraid of papishes
i know a great many papishes that are very honest sort of people and spend their money very freely and it is always a maxim with me that one man's money is as good as another's  very true mistress said the puppetshow man i don't care what religion comes provided the presbyterians are not uppermost for they are enemies to puppetshows  and so you would sacrifice your religion to your interest cries the exciseman and are desirous to see popery brought in are you  not i truly answered the other i hate popery as much as any man but yet it is a comfort to one that one should be able to live under it which i could not do among presbyterians
to be sure every man values his livelihood first that must be granted and i warrant if you would confess the truth you are more afraid of losing your place than anything else but never fear friend there will be an excise under another government as well as under this  why certainly replied the exciseman i should be a very ill man if i did not honour the king whose bread i eat
that is no more than natural as a man may say for what signifies it to me that there would be an exciseoffice under another government since my friends would be out and i could expect no better than to follow them
no no friend i shall never be bubbled out of my religion in hopes only of keeping my place under another government for i should certainly be no better and very probably might be worse  why that is what i say cries the landlord whenever folks say who knows what may happen
odsooks
should not i be a blockhead to lend my money to i know not who because mayhap he may return it again
i am sure it is safe in my own bureau and there i will keep it  the attorney's clerk had taken a great fancy to the sagacity of partridge
whether this proceeded from the great discernment which the former had into men as well as things or whether it arose from the sympathy between their minds for they were both truly jacobites in principle they now shook hands heartily and drank bumpers of strong beer to healths which we think proper to bury in oblivion
these healths were afterwards pledged by all present and even by my landlord himself though reluctantly but he could not withstand the menaces of the clerk who swore he would never set his foot within his house again if he refused
the bumpers which were swallowed on this occasion soon put an end to the conversation
here therefore we will put an end to the chapter
chapter viii
in which fortune seems to have been in a better humour with jones than we have hitherto seen her
as there is no wholesomer so perhaps there are few stronger sleeping potions than fatigue
of this jones might be said to have taken a very large dose and it operated very forcibly upon him
he had already slept nine hours and might perhaps have slept longer had he not been awakened by a most violent noise at his chamberdoor where the sound of many heavy blows was accompanied with many exclamations of murder
jones presently leapt from his bed where he found the master of the puppetshow belabouring the back and ribs of his poor merryandrew without either mercy or moderation
jones instantly interposed on behalf of the suffering party and pinned the insulting conqueror up to the wall for the puppetshow man was no more able to contend with jones than the poor partycoloured jester had been to contend with this puppetman
but though the merryandrew was a little fellow and not very strong he had nevertheless some choler about him
he therefore no sooner found himself delivered from the enemy than he began to attack him with the only weapon at which he was his equal
from this he first discharged a volley of general abusive words and thence proceeded to some particular accusationsdn your bld you rascal says he i have not only supported you for to me you owe all the money you get but i have saved you from the gallows
did you not want to rob the lady of her fine ridinghabit no longer ago than yesterday in the backlane here
can you deny that you wished to have her alone in a wood to strip herto strip one of the prettiest ladies that ever was seen in the world
and here you have fallen upon me and have almost murdered me for doing no harm to a girl as willing as myself only because she likes me better than you  jones no sooner heard this than he quitted the master laying on him at the same time the most violent injunctions of forbearance from any further insult on the merryandrew and then taking the poor wretch with him into his own apartment he soon learned tidings of his sophia whom the fellow as he was attending his master with his drum the day before had seen pass by
he easily prevailed with the lad to show him the exact place and then having summoned partridge he departed with the utmost expedition
it was almost eight of the clock before all matters could be got ready for his departure for partridge was not in any haste nor could the reckoning be presently adjusted and when both these were settled and over jones would not quit the place before he had perfectly reconciled all differences between the master and the man
when this was happily accomplished he set forwards and was by the trusty merryandrew conducted to the spot by which sophia had past and then having handsomely rewarded his conductor he again pushed on with the utmost eagerness being highly delighted with the extraordinary manner in which he received his intelligence
of this partridge was no sooner acquainted than he with great earnestness began to prophesy and assured jones that he would certainly have good success in the end for he said two such accidents could never have happened to direct him after his mistress if providence had not designed to bring them together at last and this was the first time that jones lent any attention to the superstitious doctrines of his companion
they had not gone above two miles when a violent storm of rain overtook them and as they happened to be at the same time in sight of an alehouse partridge with much earnest entreaty prevailed with jones to enter and weather the storm
hunger is an enemy if indeed it may be called one which partakes more of the english than of the french disposition for though you subdue this never so often it will always rally again in time and so it did with partridge who was no sooner arrived within the kitchen than he began to ask the same questions which he had asked the night before
the consequence of this was an excellent cold chine being produced upon the table upon which not only partridge but jones himself made a very hearty breakfast though the latter began to grow again uneasy as the people of the house could give him no fresh information concerning sophia
their meal being over jones was again preparing to sally notwithstanding the violence of the storm still continued but partridge begged heartily for another mug and at last casting his eyes on a lad at the fire who had entered into the kitchen and who at that instant was looking as earnestly at him he turned suddenly to jones and cried master give me your hand a single mug shan't serve the turn this bout
why here's more news of madam sophia come to town
the boy there standing by the fire is the very lad that rode before her
i can swear to my own plaister on his faceheavens bless you sir cries the boy it is your own plaister sure enough i shall have always reason to remember your goodness for it hath almost cured me  at these words jones started from his chair and bidding the boy follow him immediately departed from the kitchen into a private apartment for so delicate was he with regard to sophia that he never willingly mentioned her name in the presence of many people and though he had as it were from the overflowings of his heart given sophia as a toast among the officers where he thought it was impossible she should be known yet even there the reader may remember how difficultly he was prevailed upon to mention her surname
hard therefore was it and perhaps in the opinion of many sagacious readers very absurd and monstrous that he should principally owe his present misfortune to the supposed want of that delicacy with which he so abounded for in reality sophia was much more offended at the freedoms which she thought and not without good reason he had taken with her name and character than at any freedoms in which under his present circumstances he had indulged himself with the person of another woman and to say truth i believe honour could never have prevailed on her to leave upton without her seeing jones had it not been for those two strong instances of a levity in his behaviour so void of respect and indeed so highly inconsistent with any degree of love and tenderness in great and delicate minds
but so matters fell out and so i must relate them and if any reader is shocked at their appearing unnatural i cannot help it
i must remind such persons that i am not writing a system but a history and i am not obliged to reconcile every matter to the received notions concerning truth and nature
but if this was never so easy to do perhaps it might be more prudent in me to avoid it
for instance as the fact at present before us now stands without any comment of mine upon it though it may at first sight offend some readers yet upon more mature consideration it must please all for wise and good men may consider what happened to jones at upton as a just punishment for his wickedness with regard to women of which it was indeed the immediate consequence and silly and bad persons may comfort themselves in their vices by flattering their own hearts that the characters of men are rather owing to accident than to virtue
now perhaps the reflections which we should be here inclined to draw would alike contradict both these conclusions and would show that these incidents contribute only to confirm the great useful and uncommon doctrine which it is the purpose of this whole work to inculcate and which we must not fill up our pages by frequently repeating as an ordinary parson fills his sermon by repeating his text at the end of every paragraph
we are contented that it must appear however unhappily sophia had erred in her opinion of jones she had sufficient reason for her opinion since i believe every other young lady would in her situation have erred in the same manner
nay had she followed her lover at this very time and had entered this very alehouse the moment he was departed from it she would have found the landlord as well acquainted with her name and person as the wench at upton had appeared to be
for while jones was examining his boy in whispers in an inner room partridge who had no such delicacy in his disposition was in the kitchen very openly catechising the other guide who had attended mrs fitzpatrick by which means the landlord whose ears were open on all such occasions became perfectly well acquainted with the tumble of sophia from her horse c with the mistake concerning jenny cameron with the many consequences of the punch and in short with almost everything which had happened at the inn whence we despatched our ladies in a coachandsix when we last took our leaves of them
chapter ix
containing little more than a few odd observations
jones had been absent a full halfhour when he returned into the kitchen in a hurry desiring the landlord to let him know that instant what was to pay
and now the concern which partridge felt at being obliged to quit the warm chimneycorner and a cup of excellent liquor was somewhat compensated by hearing that he was to proceed no farther on foot for jones by golden arguments had prevailed with the boy to attend him back to the inn whither he had before conducted sophia but to this however the lad consented upon condition that the other guide would wait for him at the alehouse because as the landlord at upton was an intimate acquaintance of the landlord at gloucester it might some time or other come to the ears of the latter that his horses had been let to more than one person and so the boy might be brought to account for money which he wisely intended to put in his own pocket
we were obliged to mention this circumstance trifling as it may seem since it retarded mr jones a considerable time in his setting out for the honesty of this latter boy was somewhat highthat is somewhat highpriced and would indeed have cost jones very dear had not partridge who as we have said was a very cunning fellow artfully thrown in halfacrown to be spent at that very alehouse while the boy was waiting for his companion
this halfcrown the landlord no sooner got scent of than he opened after it with such vehement and persuasive outcry that the boy was soon overcome and consented to take halfacrown more for his stay
here we cannot help observing that as there is so much of policy in the lowest life great men often overvalue themselves on those refinements in imposture in which they are frequently excelled by some of the lowest of the human species
the horses being now produced jones directly leapt into the sidesaddle on which his dear sophia had rid
the lad indeed very civilly offered him the use of his but he chose the sidesaddle probably because it was softer
partridge however though full as effeminate as jones could not bear the thoughts of degrading his manhood he therefore accepted the boy's offer and now jones being mounted on the sidesaddle of his sophia the boy on that of mrs honour and partridge bestriding the third horse they set forwards on their journey and within four hours arrived at the inn where the reader hath already spent so much time
partridge was in very high spirits during the whole way and often mentioned to jones the many good omens of his future success which had lately befriended him and which the reader without being the least superstitious must allow to have been particularly fortunate
partridge was moreover better pleased with the present pursuit of his companion than he had been with his pursuit of glory and from these very omens which assured the pedagogue of success he likewise first acquired a clear idea of the amour between jones and sophia to which he had before given very little attention as he had originally taken a wrong scent concerning the reasons of jones's departure and as to what happened at upton he was too much frightened just before and after his leaving that place to draw any other conclusions from thence than that poor jones was a downright madman a conceit which was not at all disagreeable to the opinion he before had of his extraordinary wildness of which he thought his behaviour on their quitting gloucester so well justified all the accounts he had formerly received
he was now however pretty well satisfied with his present expedition and henceforth began to conceive much worthier sentiments of his friend's understanding
the clock had just struck three when they arrived and jones immediately bespoke posthorses but unluckily there was not a horse to be procured in the whole place which the reader will not wonder at when he considers the hurry in which the whole nation and especially this part of it was at this time engaged when expresses were passing and repassing every hour of the day and night
jones endeavoured all he could to prevail with his former guide to escorte him to coventry but he was inexorable
while he was arguing with the boy in the innyard a person came up to him and saluting him by his name enquired how all the good family did in somersetshire and now jones casting his eyes upon this person presently discovered him to be mr dowling the lawyer with whom he had dined at gloucester and with much courtesy returned the salutation
dowling very earnestly pressed mr jones to go no further that night and backed his solicitations with many unanswerable arguments such as that it was almost dark that the roads were very dirty and that he would be able to travel much better by daylight with many others equally good some of which jones had probably suggested to himself before but as they were then ineffectual so they were still and he continued resolute in his design even though he should be obliged to set out on foot
when the good attorney found he could not prevail on jones to stay he as strenuously applied himself to persuade the guide to accompany him
he urged many motives to induce him to undertake this short journey and at last concluded with saying do you think the gentleman won't very well reward you for your trouble  two to one are odds at every other thing as well as at football
but the advantage which this united force hath in persuasion or entreaty must have been visible to a curious observer for he must have often seen that when a father a master a wife or any other person in authority have stoutly adhered to a denial against all the reasons which a single man could produce they have afterwards yielded to the repetition of the same sentiments by a second or third person who hath undertaken the cause without attempting to advance anything new in its behalf
and hence perhaps proceeds the phrase of seconding an argument or a motion and the great consequence this is of in all assemblies of public debate
hence likewise probably it is that in our courts of law we often hear a learned gentleman generally a serjeant repeating for an hour together what another learned gentleman who spoke just before him had been saying
instead of accounting for this we shall proceed in our usual manner to exemplify it in the conduct of the lad above mentioned who submitted to the persuasions of mr dowling and promised once more to admit jones into his sidesaddle but insisted on first giving the poor creatures a good bait saying they had travelled a great way and been rid very hard
indeed this caution of the boy was needless for jones notwithstanding his hurry and impatience would have ordered this of himself for he by no means agreed with the opinion of those who consider animals as mere machines and when they bury their spurs in the belly of their horse imagine the spur and the horse to have an equal capacity of feeling pain
while the beasts were eating their corn or rather were supposed to eat it for as the boy was taking care of himself in the kitchen the ostler took great care that his corn should not be consumed in the stable mr jones at the earnest desire of mr dowling accompanied that gentleman into his room where they sat down together over a bottle of wine
chapter x
in which mr jones and mr dowling drink a bottle together
mr dowling pouring out a glass of wine named the health of the good squire allworthy adding if you please sir we will likewise remember his nephew and heir the young squire come sir here's mr blifil to you a very pretty young gentleman and who i dare swear will hereafter make a very considerable figure in his country
i have a borough for him myself in my eye  sir answered jones i am convinced you don't intend to affront me so i shall not resent it but i promise you you have joined two persons very improperly together for one is the glory of the human species and the other is a rascal who dishonours the name of man  dowling stared at this
he said he thought both the gentlemen had a very unexceptionable character
as for squire allworthy himself says he i never had the happiness to see him but all the world talks of his goodness
and indeed as to the young gentleman i never saw him but once when i carried him the news of the loss of his mother and then i was so hurried and drove and tore with the multiplicity of business that i had hardly time to converse with him but he looked so like a very honest gentleman and behaved himself so prettily that i protest i never was more delighted with any gentleman since i was born  i don't wonder answered jones that he should impose upon you in so short an acquaintance for he hath the cunning of the devil himself and you may live with him many years without discovering him
i was bred up with him from my infancy and we were hardly ever asunder but it is very lately only that i have discovered half the villany which is in him
i own i never greatly liked him
i thought he wanted that generosity of spirit which is the sure foundation of all that is great and noble in human nature
i saw a selfishness in him long ago which i despised but it is lately very lately that i have found him capable of the basest and blackest designs for indeed i have at last found out that he hath taken an advantage of the openness of my own temper and hath concerted the deepest project by a long train of wicked artifice to work my ruin which at last he hath effected  ay
ay cries dowling i protest then it is a pity such a person should inherit the great estate of your uncle allworthy  alas sir cries jones you do me an honour to which i have no title
it is true indeed his goodness once allowed me the liberty of calling him by a much nearer name but as this was only a voluntary act of goodness i can complain of no injustice when he thinks proper to deprive me of this honour since the loss cannot be more unmerited than the gift originally was
i assure you sir i am no relation of mr allworthy and if the world who are incapable of setting a true value on his virtue should think in his behaviour to me he hath dealt hardly by a relation they do an injustice to the best of men for ibut i ask your pardon i shall trouble you with no particulars relating to myself only as you seemed to think me a relation of mr allworthy i thought proper to set you right in a matter that might draw some censures upon him which i promise you i would rather lose my life than give occasion to  i protest sir cried dowling you talk very much like a man of honour but instead of giving me any trouble i protest it would give me great pleasure to know how you came to be thought a relation of mr allworthy's if you are not
your horses won't be ready this halfhour and as you have sufficient opportunity i wish you would tell me how all that happened for i protest it seems very surprizing that you should pass for a relation of a gentleman without being so  jones who in the compliance of his disposition though not in his prudence a little resembled his lovely sophia was easily prevailed on to satisfy mr dowling's curiosity by relating the history of his birth and education which he did like othello
even from his boyish years       to th' very moment he was bad to tell  the which to hear dowling like desdemona did seriously incline       he swore 'twas strange 'twas passing strange      'twas pitiful 'twas wonderous pitiful
mr dowling was indeed very greatly affected with this relation for he had not divested himself of humanity by being an attorney
indeed nothing is more unjust than to carry our prejudices against a profession into private life and to borrow our idea of a man from our opinion of his calling
habit it is true lessens the horror of those actions which the profession makes necessary and consequently habitual but in all other instances nature works in men of all professions alike nay perhaps even more strongly with those who give her as it were a holiday when they are following their ordinary business
a butcher i make no doubt would feel compunction at the slaughter of a fine horse and though a surgeon can feel no pain in cutting off a limb i have known him compassionate a man in a fit of the gout
the common hangman who hath stretched the necks of hundreds is known to have trembled at his first operation on a head and the very professors of human bloodshedding who in their trade of war butcher thousands not only of their fellowprofessors but often of women and children without remorse even these i say in times of peace when drums and trumpets are laid aside often lay aside all their ferocity and become very gentle members of civil society
in the same manner an attorney may feel all the miseries and distresses of his fellowcreatures provided he happens not to be concerned against them
jones as the reader knows was yet unacquainted with the very black colours in which he had been represented to mr allworthy and as to other matters he did not shew them in the most disadvantageous light for though he was unwilling to cast any blame on his former friend and patron yet he was not very desirous of heaping too much upon himself
dowling therefore observed and not without reason that very ill offices must have been done him by somebody for certainly cries he the squire would never have disinherited you only for a few faults which any young gentleman might have committed
indeed i cannot properly say disinherited for to be sure by law you cannot claim as heir
that's certain that nobody need go to counsel for
yet when a gentleman had in a manner adopted you thus as his own son you might reasonably have expected some very considerable part if not the whole nay if you had expected the whole i should not have blamed you for certainly all men are for getting as much as they can and they are not to be blamed on that account  indeed you wrong me said jones i should have been contented with very little i never had any view upon mr allworthy's fortune nay i believe i may truly say i never once considered what he could or might give me
this i solemnly declare if he had done a prejudice to his nephew in my favour i would have undone it again
i had rather enjoy my own mind than the fortune of another man
what is the poor pride arising from a magnificent house a numerous equipage a splendid table and from all the other advantages or appearances of fortune compared to the warm solid content the swelling satisfaction the thrilling transports and the exulting triumphs which a good mind enjoys in the contemplation of a generous virtuous noble benevolent action
i envy not blifil in the prospect of his wealth nor shall i envy him in the possession of it
i would not think myself a rascal half an hour to exchange situations
i believe indeed mr blifil suspected me of the views you mention and i suppose these suspicions as they arose from the baseness of his own heart so they occasioned his baseness to me
but i thank heaven i know i feeli feel my innocence my friend and i would not part with that feeling for the world
for as long as i know i have never done nor even designed an injury to any being whatever       pone me pigris ubi nulla campis      arbor aestiva recreatur aura      quod latus mundi nebulae malusque      jupiter urget
pone sub curru nimium propinqui      solis in terra dominibus negata      dulce ridentem lalagen amabo      dulce loquentem        place me where never summer breeze      unbinds the glebe or warms the trees      where everlowering clouds appear      and angry jove deforms th' inclement year
place me beneath the burning ray      where rolls the rapid car of day      love and the nymph shall charm my toils      the nymph who sweetly speaks and sweetly smiles
mr francis
he then filled a bumper of wine and drunk it off to the health of his dear lalage and filling dowling's glass likewise up to the brim insisted on his pledging him
why then here's miss lalage's health with all my heart cries dowling
i have heard her toasted often i protest though i never saw her but they say she's extremely handsome  though the latin was not the only part of this speech which dowling did not perfectly understand yet there was somewhat in it that made a very strong impression upon him
and though he endeavoured by winking nodding sneering and grinning to hide the impression from jones for we are as often ashamed of thinking right as of thinking wrong it is certain he secretly approved as much of his sentiments as he understood and really felt a very strong impulse of compassion for him
but we may possibly take some other opportunity of commenting upon this especially if we should happen to meet mr dowling any more in the course of our history
at present we are obliged to take our leave of that gentleman a little abruptly in imitation of mr jones who was no sooner informed by partridge that his horses were ready than he deposited his reckoning wished his companion a good night mounted and set forward towards coventry though the night was dark and it just then began to rain very hard
chapter xi
the disasters which befel jones on his departure for coventry with the sage remarks of partridge
no road can be plainer than that from the place where they now were to coventry and though neither jones nor partridge nor the guide had ever travelled it before it would have been almost impossible to have missed their way had it not been for the two reasons mentioned in the conclusion of the last chapter
these two circumstances however happening both unfortunately to intervene our travellers deviated into a much less frequented track and after riding full six miles instead of arriving at the stately spires of coventry they found themselves still in a very dirty lane where they saw no symptoms of approaching the suburbs of a large city
jones now declared that they must certainly have lost their way but this the guide insisted upon was impossible a word which in common conversation is often used to signify not only improbable but often what is really very likely and sometimes what hath certainly happened an hyperbolical violence like that which is so frequently offered to the words infinite and eternal by the former of which it is usual to express a distance of half a yard and by the latter a duration of five minutes
and thus it is as usual to assert the impossibility of losing what is already actually lost
this was in fact the case at present for notwithstanding all the confident assertions of the lad to the contrary it is certain they were no more in the right road to coventry than the fraudulent griping cruel canting miser is in the right road to heaven
it is not perhaps easy for a reader who hath never been in those circumstances to imagine the horror with which darkness rain and wind fill persons who have lost their way in the night and who consequently have not the pleasant prospect of warm fires dry cloaths and other refreshments to support their minds in struggling with the inclemencies of the weather
a very imperfect idea of this horror will however serve sufficiently to account for the conceits which now filled the head of partridge and which we shall presently be obliged to open
jones grew more and more positive that they were out of their road and the boy himself at last acknowledged he believed they were not in the right road to coventry though he affirmed at the same time it was impossible they should have mist the way
but partridge was of a different opinion
he said when they first set out he imagined some mischief or other would happendid not you observe sir said he to jones that old woman who stood at the door just as you was taking horse
i wish you had given her a small matter with all my heart for she said then you might repent it and at that very instant it began to rain and the wind hath continued rising ever since
whatever some people may think i am very certain it is in the power of witches to raise the wind whenever they please
i have seen it happen very often in my time and if ever i saw a witch in all my life that old woman was certainly one
i thought so to myself at that very time and if i had had any halfpence in my pocket i would have given her some for to be sure it is always good to be charitable to those sort of people for fear what may happen and many a person hath lost his cattle by saving a halfpenny  jones though he was horridly vexed at the delay which this mistake was likely to occasion in his journey could not help smiling at the superstition of his friend whom an accident now greatly confirmed in his opinion
this was a tumble from his horse by which however he received no other injury than what the dirt conferred on his cloaths
partridge had no sooner recovered his legs than he appealed to his fall as conclusive evidence of all he had asserted but jones finding he was unhurt answered with a smile this witch of yours partridge is a most ungrateful jade and doth not i find distinguish her friends from others in her resentment
if the old lady had been angry with me for neglecting her i don't see why she should tumble you from your horse after all the respect you have expressed for her  it is ill jesting cries partridge with people who have power to do these things for they are often very malicious
i remember a farrier who provoked one of them by asking her when the time she had bargained with the devil for would be out and within three months from that very day one of his best cows was drowned
nor was she satisfied with that for a little time afterwards he lost a barrel of bestdrink for the old witch pulled out the spigot and let it run all over the cellar the very first evening he had tapped it to make merry with some of his neighbours
in short nothing ever thrived with him afterwards for she worried the poor man so that he took to drinking and in a year or two his stock was seized and he and his family are now come to the parish  the guide and perhaps his horse too were both so attentive to this discourse that either through want of care or by the malice of the witch they were now both sprawling in the dirt
partridge entirely imputed this fall as he had done his own to the same cause
he told mr jones it would certainly be his turn next and earnestly entreated him to return back and find out the old woman and pacify her
we shall very soon added he reach the inn for though we have seemed to go forward i am very certain we are in the identical place in which we were an hour ago and i dare swear if it was daylight we might now see the inn we set out from  instead of returning any answer to this sage advice jones was entirely attentive to what had happened to the boy who received no other hurt than what had before befallen partridge and which his cloaths very easily bore as they had been for many years inured to the like
he soon regained his sidesaddle and by the hearty curses and blows which he bestowed on his horse quickly satisfied mr jones that no harm was done
chapter xii
relates that mr jones continued his journey contrary to the advice of partridge with what happened on that occasion
they now discovered a light at some distance to the great pleasure of jones and to the no small terror of partridge who firmly believed himself to be bewitched and that this light was a jackwithalantern or somewhat more mischievous
but how were these fears increased when as they approached nearer to this light or lights as they now appeared they heard a confused sound of human voices of singing laughing and hallowing together with a strange noise that seemed to proceed from some instruments but could hardly be allowed the name of music
indeed to favour a little the opinion of partridge it might very well be called music bewitched
it is impossible to conceive a much greater degree of horror than what now seized on partridge the contagion of which had reached the postboy who had been very attentive to many things that the other had uttered
he now therefore joined in petitioning jones to return saying he firmly believed what partridge had just before said that though the horses seemed to go on they had not moved a step forwards during at least the last halfhour
jones could not help smiling in the midst of his vexation at the fears of these poor fellows
either we advance says he towards the lights or the lights have advanced towards us for we are now at a very little distance from them but how can either of you be afraid of a set of people who appear only to be merrymaking  merrymaking sir cries partridge who could be merrymaking at this time of night and in such a place and such weather
they can be nothing but ghosts or witches or some evil spirits or other that's certain  let them be what they will cries jones i am resolved to go up to them and enquire the way to coventry
all witches partridge are not such illnatured hags as that we had the misfortune to meet with last  o lord sir cries partridge there is no knowing what humour they will be in to be sure it is always best to be civil to them but what if we should meet with something worse than witches with evil spirits themselvespray sir be advised pray sir do
if you had read so many terrible accounts as i have of these matters you would not be so foolhardythe lord knows whither we have got already or whither we are going for sure such darkness was never seen upon earth and i question whether it can be darker in the other world  jones put forwards as fast as he could notwithstanding all these hints and cautions and poor partridge was obliged to follow for though he hardly dared to advance he dared still less to stay behind by himself
at length they arrived at the place whence the lights and different noises had issued
this jones perceived to be no other than a barn where a great number of men and women were assembled and diverting themselves with much apparent jollity
jones no sooner appeared before the great doors of the barn which were open than a masculine and very rough voice from within demanded who was thereto which jones gently answered a friend and immediately asked the road to coventry
if you are a friend cries another of the men in the barn you had better alight till the storm is over for indeed it was now more violent than ever you are very welcome to put up your horse for there is sufficient room for him at the end of the barn  you are very obliging returned jones and i will accept your offer for a few minutes whilst the rain continues and here are two more who will be glad of the same favour this was accorded with more goodwill than it was accepted for partridge would rather have submitted to the utmost inclemency of the weather than have trusted to the clemency of those whom he took for hobgoblins and the poor postboy was now infected with the same apprehensions but they were both obliged to follow the example of jones the one because he durst not leave his horse and the other because he feared nothing so much as being left by himself
had this history been writ in the days of superstition i should have had too much compassion for the reader to have left him so long in suspense whether beelzebub or satan was about actually to appear in person with all his hellish retinue but as these doctrines are at present very unfortunate and have but few if any believers i have not been much aware of conveying any such terrors
to say truth the whole furniture of the infernal regions hath long been appropriated by the managers of playhouses who seem lately to have laid them by as rubbish capable only of affecting the upper gallery a place in which few of our readers ever sit
however though we do not suspect raising any great terror on this occasion we have reason to fear some other apprehensions may here arise in our reader into which we would not willingly betray him i mean that we are going to take a voyage into fairyland and introduce a set of beings into our history which scarce any one was ever childish enough to believe though many have been foolish enough to spend their time in writing and reading their adventures
to prevent therefore any such suspicions so prejudicial to the credit of an historian who professes to draw his materials from nature only we shall now proceed to acquaint the reader who these people were whose sudden appearance had struck such terrors into partridge had more than half frightened the postboy and had a little surprized even mr jones himself
the people then assembled in this barn were no other than a company of egyptians or as they are vulgarly called gypsies and they were now celebrating the wedding of one of their society
it is impossible to conceive a happier set of people than appeared here to be met together
the utmost mirth indeed shewed itself in every countenance nor was their ball totally void of all order and decorum
perhaps it had more than a country assembly is sometimes conducted with for these people are subject to a formal government and laws of their own and all pay obedience to one great magistrate whom they call their king
greater plenty likewise was nowhere to be seen than what flourished in this barn
here was indeed no nicety nor elegance nor did the keen appetite of the guests require any
here was good store of bacon fowls and mutton to which every one present provided better sauce himself than the best and dearest french cook can prepare
aeneas is not described under more consternation in the temple of juno  dum stupet obtutuque haeret defixus in uno  than was our heroe at what he saw in this barn
while he was looking everywhere round him with astonishment a venerable person approached him with many friendly salutations rather of too hearty a kind to be called courtly
this was no other than the king of the gypsies himself
he was very little distinguished in dress from his subjects nor had he any regalia of majesty to support his dignity and yet there seemed as mr jones said to be somewhat in his air which denoted authority and inspired the beholders with an idea of awe and respect though all this was perhaps imaginary in jones and the truth may be that such ideas are incident to power and almost inseparable from it
there was somewhat in the open countenance and courteous behaviour of jones which being accompanied with much comeliness of person greatly recommended him at first sight to every beholder
these were perhaps a little heightened in the present instance by that profound respect which he paid to the king of the gypsies the moment he was acquainted with his dignity and which was the sweeter to his gypseian majesty as he was not used to receive such homage from any but his own subjects
the king ordered a table to be spread with the choicest of their provisions for his accommodation and having placed himself at his right hand his majesty began to discourse with our heroe in the following manner  me doubt not sir but you have often seen some of my people who are what you call de parties detache for dey go about everywhere but me fancy you imagine not we be so considrable body as we be and may be you will be surprize more when you hear de gypsy be as orderly and well govern people as any upon face of de earth
me have honour as me say to be deir king and no monarch can do boast of more dutiful subject ne no more affectionate
how far me deserve deir goodwill me no say but dis me can say dat me never design anyting but to do dem good
me sall no do boast of dat neider for what can me do oderwise dan consider of de good of dose poor people who go about all day to give me always de best of what dey get
dey love and honour me darefore because me do love and take care of dem dat is all me know no oder reason
about a tousand or two tousand year ago me cannot tell to a year or two as can neider write nor read dere was a great what you calla volution among de gypsy for dere was de lord gypsy in dose days and dese lord did quarrel vid one anoder about de place but de king of de gypsy did demolish dem all and made all his subject equal vid each oder and since dat time dey have agree very well for dey no tink of being king and may be it be better for dem as dey be for me assure you it be ver troublesome ting to be king and always to do justice me have often wish to be de private gypsy when me have been forced to punish my dear friend and relation for dough we never put to death our punishments be ver severe
dey make de gypsy ashamed of demselves and dat be ver terrible punishment me ave scarce ever known de gypsy so punish do harm any more  the king then proceeded to express some wonder that there was no such punishment as shame in other governments
upon which jones assured him to the contrary for that there were many crimes for which shame was inflicted by the english laws and that it was indeed one consequence of all punishment
dat be ver strange said the king for me know and hears good deal of your people dough me no live among dem and me have often hear dat sham is de consequence and de cause too of many of your rewards
are your rewards and punishments den de same ting  while his majesty was thus discoursing with jones a sudden uproar arose in the barn and as it seems upon this occasionthe courtesy of these people had by degrees removed all the apprehensions of partridge and he was prevailed upon not only to stuff himself with their food but to taste some of their liquors which by degrees entirely expelled all fear from his composition and in its stead introduced much more agreeable sensations
a young female gypsy more remarkable for her wit than her beauty had decoyed the honest fellow aside pretending to tell his fortune
now when they were alone together in a remote part of the barn whether it proceeded from the strong liquor which is never so apt to inflame inordinate desire as after moderate fatigue or whether the fair gypsy herself threw aside the delicacy and decency of her sex and tempted the youth partridge with express solicitations but they were discovered in a very improper manner by the husband of the gypsy who from jealousy it seems had kept a watchful eye over his wife and had dogged her to the place where he found her in the arms of her gallant
to the great confusion of jones partridge was now hurried before the king who heard the accusation and likewise the culprit's defence which was indeed very trifling for the poor fellow was confounded by the plain evidence which appeared against him and had very little to say for himself
his majesty then turning towards jones said sir you have hear what dey say what punishment do you tink your man deserve  jones answered he was sorry for what had happened and that partridge should make the husband all the amends in his power he said he had very little money about him at that time and putting his hand into his pocket offered the fellow a guinea
to which he immediately answered he hoped his honour would not think of giving him less than five  this sum after some altercation was reduced to two and jones having stipulated for the full forgiveness of both partridge and the wife was going to pay the money when his majesty restraining his hand turned to the witness and asked him at what time he had discovered the criminals to which he answered that he had been desired by the husband to watch the motions of his wife from her first speaking to the stranger and that he had never lost sight of her afterwards till the crime had been committed the king then asked if the husband was with him all that time in his lurkingplace to which he answered in the affirmative
his egyptian majesty then addressed himself to the husband as follows me be sorry to see any gypsy dat have no more honour dan to sell de honour of his wife for money
if you had de love for your wife you would have prevented dis matter and not endeavour to make her de whore dat you might discover her
me do order dat you have no money given you for you deserve punishment not reward me do order derefore dat you be de infamous gypsy and do wear pair of horns upon your forehead for one month and dat your wife be called de whore and pointed at all dat time for you be de infamous gypsy but she be no less de infamous whore  the gypsies immediately proceeded to execute the sentence and left jones and partridge alone with his majesty
jones greatly applauded the justice of the sentence upon which the king turning to him said me believe you be surprize for me suppose you have ver bad opinion of my people me suppose you tink us all de tieves  i must confess sir said jones i have not heard so favourable an account of them as they seem to deserve  me vil tell you said the king how the difference is between you and us
my people rob your people and your people rob one anoder  jones afterwards proceeded very gravely to sing forth the happiness of those subjects who live under such a magistrate
indeed their happiness appears to have been so compleat that we are aware lest some advocate for arbitrary power should hereafter quote the case of those people as an instance of the great advantages which attend that government above all others
and here we will make a concession which would not perhaps have been expected from us that no limited form of government is capable of rising to the same degree of perfection or of producing the same benefits to society with this
mankind have never been so happy as when the greatest part of the then known world was under the dominion of a single master and this state of their felicity continued during the reigns of five successive princes
 this was the true aera of the golden age and the only golden age which ever had any existence unless in the warm imaginations of the poets from the expulsion from eden down to this day
 nerva trajan adrian and the two antonini
in reality i know but of one solid objection to absolute monarchy
the only defect in which excellent constitution seems to be the difficulty of finding any man adequate to the office of an absolute monarch for this indispensably requires three qualities very difficult as it appears from history to be found in princely natures first a sufficient quantity of moderation in the prince to be contented with all the power which is possible for him to have
ndly enough of wisdom to know his own happiness
and rdly goodness sufficient to support the happiness of others when not only compatible with but instrumental to his own
now if an absolute monarch with all these great and rare qualifications should be allowed capable of conferring the greatest good on society it must be surely granted on the contrary that absolute power vested in the hands of one who is deficient in them all is likely to be attended with no less a degree of evil
in short our own religion furnishes us with adequate ideas of the blessing as well as curse which may attend absolute power
the pictures of heaven and of hell will place a very lively image of both before our eyes for though the prince of the latter can have no power but what he originally derives from the omnipotent sovereign in the former yet it plainly appears from scripture that absolute power in his infernal dominions is granted to their diabolical ruler
this is indeed the only absolute power which can by scripture be derived from heaven
if therefore the several tyrannies upon earth can prove any title to a divine authority it must be derived from this original grant to the prince of darkness and these subordinate deputations must consequently come immediately from him whose stamp they so expressly bear
to conclude as the examples of all ages shew us that mankind in general desire power only to do harm and when they obtain it use it for no other purpose it is not consonant with even the least degree of prudence to hazard an alteration where our hopes are poorly kept in countenance by only two or three exceptions out of a thousand instances to alarm our fears
in this case it will be much wiser to submit to a few inconveniencies arising from the dispassionate deafness of laws than to remedy them by applying to the passionate open ears of a tyrant
nor can the example of the gypsies though possibly they may have long been happy under this form of government be here urged since we must remember the very material respect in which they differ from all other people and to which perhaps this their happiness is entirely owing namely that they have no false honours among them and that they look on shame as the most grievous punishment in the world
chapter xiii
a dialogue between jones and partridge
the honest lovers of liberty will we doubt not pardon that long digression into which we were led at the close of the last chapter to prevent our history from being applied to the use of the most pernicious doctrine which priestcraft had ever the wickedness or the impudence to preach
we will now proceed with mr jones who when the storm was over took leave of his egyptian majesty after many thanks for his courteous behaviour and kind entertainment and set out for coventry to which place for it was still dark a gypsy was ordered to conduct him
jones having by reason of his deviation travelled eleven miles instead of six and most of those through very execrable roads where no expedition could have been made in quest of a midwife did not arrive at coventry till near twelve
nor could he possibly get again into the saddle till past two for posthorses were now not easy to get nor were the hostler or postboy in half so great a hurry as himself but chose rather to imitate the tranquil disposition of partridge who being denied the nourishment of sleep took all opportunities to supply its place with every other kind of nourishment and was never better pleased than when he arrived at an inn nor ever more dissatisfied than when he was again forced to leave it
jones now travelled post we will follow him therefore according to our custom and to the rules of longinus in the same manner
from coventry he arrived at daventry from daventry at stratford and from stratford at dunstable whither he came the next day a little after noon and within a few hours after sophia had left it and though he was obliged to stay here longer than he wished while a smith with great deliberation shoed the posthorse he was to ride he doubted not but to overtake his sophia before she should set out from st albans at which place he concluded and very reasonably that his lordship would stop and dine
and had he been right in this conjecture he most probably would have overtaken his angel at the aforesaid place but unluckily my lord had appointed a dinner to be prepared for him at his own house in london and in order to enable him to reach that place in proper time he had ordered a relay of horses to meet him at st albans
when jones therefore arrived there he was informed that the coachandsix had set out two hours before
if fresh posthorses had been now ready as they were not it seemed so apparently impossible to overtake the coach before it reached london that partridge thought he had now a proper opportunity to remind his friend of a matter which he seemed entirely to have forgotten what this was the reader will guess when we inform him that jones had eat nothing more than one poached egg since he had left the alehouse where he had first met the guide returning from sophia for with the gypsies he had feasted only his understanding
the landlord so entirely agreed with the opinion of mr partridge that he no sooner heard the latter desire his friend to stay and dine than he very readily put in his word and retracting his promise before given of furnishing the horses immediately he assured mr jones he would lose no time in bespeaking a dinner which he said could be got ready sooner than it was possible to get the horses up from grass and to prepare them for their journey by a feed of corn
jones was at length prevailed on chiefly by the latter argument of the landlord and now a joint of mutton was put down to the fire
while this was preparing partridge being admitted into the same apartment with his friend or master began to harangue in the following manner
certainly sir if ever man deserved a young lady you deserve young madam western for what a vast quantity of love must a man have to be able to live upon it without any other food as you do
i am positive i have eat thirty times as much within these last twentyfour hours as your honour and yet i am almost famished for nothing makes a man so hungry as travelling especially in this cold raw weather
and yet i can't tell how it is but your honour is seemingly in perfect good health and you never looked better nor fresher in your life
it must be certainly love that you live upon  and a very rich diet too partridge answered jones
but did not fortune send me an excellent dainty yesterday
dost thou imagine i cannot live more than twentyfour hours on this dear pocketbook  undoubtedly cries partridge there is enough in that pocketbook to purchase many a good meal
fortune sent it to your honour very opportunely for present use as your honour's money must be almost out by this time  what do you mean answered jones i hope you don't imagine that i should be dishonest enough even if it belonged to any other person besides miss western  dishonest replied partridge heaven forbid i should wrong your honour so much
but where's the dishonesty in borrowing a little for present spending since you will be so well able to pay the lady hereafter
no indeed i would have your honour pay it again as soon as it is convenient by all means but where can be the harm in making use of it now you want it
indeed if it belonged to a poor body it would be another thing but so great a lady to be sure can never want it especially now as she is along with a lord who it can't be doubted will let her have whatever she hath need of
besides if she should want a little she can't want the whole therefore i would give her a little but i would be hanged before i mentioned the having found it at first and before i got some money of my own for london i have heard is the very worst of places to be in without money
indeed if i had not known to whom it belonged i might have thought it was the devil's money and have been afraid to use it but as you know otherwise and came honestly by it it would be an affront to fortune to part with it all again at the very time when you want it most you can hardly expect she should ever do you such another good turn for fortuna nunquam perpetuo est bona
you will do as you please notwithstanding all i say but for my part i would be hanged before i mentioned a word of the matter  by what i can see partridge cries jones hanging is a matter non longe alienum a scaevolae studiis you should say alienus says partridgei remember the passage it is an example under communis alienus immunis variis casibus serviunt if you do remember it  cries jones i find you don't understand it but i tell thee friend in plain english that he who finds another's property and wilfully detains it from the known owner deserves in foro conscientiae to be hanged no less than if he had stolen it
and as for this very identical bill which is the property of my angel and was once in her dear possession i will not deliver it into any hands but her own upon any consideration whatever no though i was as hungry as thou art and had no other means to satisfy my craving appetite this i hope to do before i sleep but if it should happen otherwise i charge thee if thou would'st not incur my displeasure for ever not to shock me any more by the bare mention of such detestable baseness  i should not have mentioned it now cries partridge if it had appeared so to me for i'm sure i scorn any wickedness as much as another but perhaps you know better and yet i might have imagined that i should not have lived so many years and have taught school so long without being able to distinguish between fas et nefas but it seems we are all to live and learn
i remember my old schoolmaster who was a prodigious great scholar used often to say polly matete cry town is my daskalon
the english of which he told us was that a child may sometimes teach his grandmother to suck eggs
i have lived to a fine purpose truly if i am to be taught my grammar at this time of day
perhaps young gentleman you may change your opinion if you live to my years for i remember i thought myself as wise when i was a stripling of one or two and twenty as i am now
i am sure i always taught alienus and my master read it so before me  there were not many instances in which partridge could provoke jones nor were there many in which partridge himself could have been hurried out of his respect
unluckily however they had both hit on one of these
we have already seen partridge could not bear to have his learning attacked nor could jones bear some passage or other in the foregoing speech
and now looking upon his companion with a contemptuous and disdainful air a thing not usual with him he cried partridge i see thou art a conceited old fool and i wish thou art not likewise an old rogue
indeed if i was as well convinced of the latter as i am of the former thou should'st travel no farther in my company  the sage pedagogue was contented with the vent which he had already given to his indignation and as the vulgar phrase is immediately drew in his horns
he said he was sorry he had uttered anything which might give offence for that he had never intended it but nemo omnibus horis sapit
as jones had the vices of a warm disposition he was entirely free from those of a cold one and if his friends must have confest his temper to have been a little too easily ruffled his enemies must at the same time have confest that it as soon subsided nor did it at all resemble the sea whose swelling is more violent and dangerous after a storm is over than while the storm itself subsists
he instantly accepted the submission of partridge shook him by the hand and with the most benign aspect imaginable said twenty kind things and at the same time very severely condemned himself though not half so severely as he will most probably be condemned by many of our good readers
partridge was now highly comforted as his fears of having offended were at once abolished and his pride completely satisfied by jones having owned himself in the wrong which submission he instantly applied to what had principally nettled him and repeated in a muttering voice to be sure sir your knowledge may be superior to mine in some things but as to the grammar i think i may challenge any man living
i think at least i have that at my finger's end  if anything could add to the satisfaction which the poor man now enjoyed he received this addition by the arrival of an excellent shoulder of mutton that at this instant came smoaking to the table
on which having both plentifully feasted they again mounted their horses and set forward for london
chapter xiv
what happened to mr jones in his journey from st albans
they were got about two miles beyond barnet and it was now the dusk of the evening when a genteellooking man but upon a very shabby horse rode up to jones and asked him whether he was going to london to which jones answered in the affirmative
the gentleman replied i should be obliged to you sir if you will accept of my company for it is very late and i am a stranger to the road jones readily complied with the request and on they travelled together holding that sort of discourse which is usual on such occasions
of this indeed robbery was the principal topic upon which subject the stranger expressed great apprehensions but jones declared he had very little to lose and consequently as little to fear
here partridge could not forbear putting in his word
your honour said he may think it a little but i am sure if i had a hundredpound banknote in my pocket as you have i should be very sorry to lose it but for my part i never was less afraid in my life for we are four of us and if we all stand by one another the best man in england can't rob us
suppose he should have a pistol he can kill but one of us and a man can die but oncethat's my comfort a man can die but once  besides the reliance on superior numbers a kind of valour which hath raised a certain nation among the moderns to a high pitch of glory there was another reason for the extraordinary courage which partridge now discovered for he had at present as much of that quality as was in the power of liquor to bestow
our company were now arrived within a mile of highgate when the stranger turned short upon jones and pulling out a pistol demanded that little banknote which partridge had mentioned
jones was at first somewhat shocked at this unexpected demand however he presently recollected himself and told the highwayman all the money he had in his pocket was entirely at his service and so saying he pulled out upwards of three guineas and offered to deliver it but the other answered with an oath that would not do
jones answered coolly he was very sorry for it and returned the money into his pocket
the highwayman then threatened if he did not deliver the banknote that moment he must shoot him holding his pistol at the same time very near to his breast
jones instantly caught hold of the fellow's hand which trembled so that he could scarce hold the pistol in it and turned the muzzle from him
a struggle then ensued in which the former wrested the pistol from the hand of his antagonist and both came from their horses on the ground together the highwayman upon his back and the victorious jones upon him
the poor fellow now began to implore mercy of the conqueror for to say the truth he was in strength by no means a match for jones
indeed sir says he i could have had no intention to shoot you for you will find the pistol was not loaded
this is the first robbery i ever attempted and i have been driven by distress to this  at this instant at about a hundred and fifty yards' distance lay another person on the ground roaring for mercy in a much louder voice than the highwayman
this was no other than partridge himself who endeavouring to make his escape from the engagement had been thrown from his horse and lay flat on his face not daring to look up and expecting every minute to be shot
in this posture he lay till the guide who was no otherwise concerned than for his horses having secured the stumbling beast came up to him and told him his master had got the better of the highwayman
partridge leapt up at this news and ran back to the place where jones stood with his sword drawn in his hand to guard the poor fellow which partridge no sooner saw than he cried out kill the villain sir run him through the body kill him this instant  luckily however for the poor wretch he had fallen into more merciful hands for jones having examined the pistol and found it to be really unloaded began to believe all the man had told him before partridge came up namely that he was a novice in the trade and that he had been driven to it by the distress he mentioned the greatest indeed imaginable that of five hungry children and a wife lying in of the sixth in the utmost want and misery
the truth of all which the highwayman most vehemently asserted and offered to convince mr jones of it if he would take the trouble to go to his house which was not above two miles off saying that he desired no favour but upon condition of proving all he had all alledged  jones at first pretended that he would take the fellow at his word and go with him declaring that his fate should depend entirely on the truth of his story
upon this the poor fellow immediately expressed so much alacrity that jones was perfectly satisfied with his veracity and began now to entertain sentiments of compassion for him
he returned the fellow his empty pistol advised him to think of honester means of relieving his distress and gave him a couple of guineas for the immediate support of his wife and his family adding he wished he had more for his sake for the hundred pound that had been mentioned was not his own  our readers will probably be divided in their opinions concerning this action some may applaud it perhaps as an act of extraordinary humanity while those of a more saturnine temper will consider it as a want of regard to that justice which every man owes his country
partridge certainly saw it in that light for he testified much dissatisfaction on the occasion quoted an old proverb and said he should not wonder if the rogue attacked them again before they reached london
the highwayman was full of expressions of thankfulness and gratitude
he actually dropt tears or pretended so to do
he vowed he would immediately return home and would never afterwards commit such a transgression whether he kept his word or no perhaps may appear hereafter
our travellers having remounted their horses arrived in town without encountering any new mishap
on the road much pleasant discourse passed between jones and partridge on the subject of their last adventure in which jones exprest a great compassion for those highwaymen who are by unavoidable distress driven as it were to such illegal courses as generally bring them to a shameful death i mean said he those only whose highest guilt extends no farther than to robbery and who are never guilty of cruelty nor insult to any person which is a circumstance that i must say to the honour of our country distinguishes the robbers of england from those of all other nations for murder is amongst those almost inseparably incident to robbery  no doubt answered partridge it is better to take away one's money than one's life and yet it is very hard upon honest men that they can't travel about their business without being in danger of these villains
and to be sure it would be better that all rogues were hanged out of the way than that one honest man should suffer
for my own part indeed i should not care to have the blood of any of them on my own hands but it is very proper for the law to hang them all
what right hath any man to take sixpence from me unless i give it him
is there any honesty in such a man  no surely cries jones no more than there is in him who takes the horses out of another man's stable or who applies to his own use the money which he finds when he knows the right owner  these hints stopt the mouth of partridge nor did he open it again till jones having thrown some sarcastical jokes on his cowardice he offered to excuse himself on the inequality of firearms saying a thousand naked men are nothing to one pistol for though it is true it will kill but one at a single discharge yet who can tell but that one may be himself     book xiii

an invocation
come bright love of fame inspire my glowing breast not thee i will call who over swelling tides of blood and tears dost bear the heroe on to glory while sighs of millions waft his spreading sails but thee fair gentle maid whom mnesis happy nymph first on the banks of hebrus did produce
thee whom maeonia educated whom mantua charmed and who on that fair hill which overlooks the proud metropolis of britain sat'st with thy milton sweetly tuning the heroic lyre fill my ravished fancy with the hopes of charming ages yet to come
foretel me that some tender maid whose grandmother is yet unborn hereafter when under the fictitious name of sophia she reads the real worth which once existed in my charlotte shall from her sympathetic breast send forth the heaving sigh
do thou teach me not only to foresee but to enjoy nay even to feed on future praise
comfort me by a solemn assurance that when the little parlour in which i sit at this instant shall be reduced to a worse furnished box i shall be read with honour by those who never knew nor saw me and whom i shall neither know nor see
and thou much plumper dame whom no airy forms nor phantoms of imagination cloathe whom the wellseasoned beef and pudding richly stained with plums delight thee i call of whom in a treckschuyte in some dutch canal the fat ufrow gelt impregnated by a jolly merchant of amsterdam was delivered in grubstreet school didst thou suck in the elements of thy erudition
here hast thou in thy maturer age taught poetry to tickle not the fancy but the pride of the patron
comedy from thee learns a grave and solemn air while tragedy storms aloud and rends th' affrighted theatres with its thunders
to soothe thy wearied limbs in slumber alderman history tells his tedious tale and again to awaken thee monsieur romance performs his surprizing tricks of dexterity
nor less thy wellfed bookseller obeys thy influence
by thy advice the heavy unread folio lump which long had dozed on the dusty shelf piecemealed into numbers runs nimbly through the nation
instructed by thee some books like quacks impose on the world by promising wonders while others turn beaus and trust all their merits to a gilded outside
come thou jolly substance with thy shining face keep back thy inspiration but hold forth thy tempting rewards thy shining chinking heap thy quickly convertible bankbill big with unseen riches thy oftenvarying stock the warm the comfortable house and lastly a fair portion of that bounteous mother whose flowing breasts yield redundant sustenance for all her numerous offspring did not some too greedily and wantonly drive their brethren from the teat
come thou and if i am too tasteless of thy valuable treasures warm my heart with the transporting thought of conveying them to others
tell me that through thy bounty the pratling babes whose innocent play hath often been interrupted by my labours may one time be amply rewarded for them
and now this illyoked pair this lean shadow and this fat substance have prompted me to write whose assistance shall i invoke to direct my pen
first genius thou gift of heaven without whose aid in vain we struggle against the stream of nature
thou who dost sow the generous seeds which art nourishes and brings to perfection
do thou kindly take me by the hand and lead me through all the mazes the winding labyrinths of nature
initiate me into all those mysteries which profane eyes never beheld
teach me which to thee is no difficult task to know mankind better than they know themselves
remove that mist which dims the intellects of mortals and causes them to adore men for their art or to detest them for their cunning in deceiving others when they are in reality the objects only of ridicule for deceiving themselves
strip off the thin disguise of wisdom from selfconceit of plenty from avarice and of glory from ambition
come thou that hast inspired thy aristophanes thy lucian thy cervantes thy rabelais thy molire thy shakespear thy swift thy marivaux fill my pages with humour till mankind learn the goodnature to laugh only at the follies of others and the humility to grieve at their own
and thou almost the constant attendant on true genius humanity bring all thy tender sensations
if thou hast already disposed of them all between thy allen and thy lyttleton steal them a little while from their bosoms
not without these the tender scene is painted
from these alone proceed the noble disinterested friendship the melting love the generous sentiment the ardent gratitude the soft compassion the candid opinion and all those strong energies of a good mind which fill the moistened eyes with tears the glowing cheeks with blood and swell the heart with tides of grief joy and benevolence
and thou o learning
for without thy assistance nothing pure nothing correct can genius produce do thou guide my pen
thee in thy favourite fields where the limpid gentlyrolling thames washes thy etonian banks in early youth i have worshipped
to thee at thy birchen altar with true spartan devotion i have sacrificed my blood
come then and from thy vast luxuriant stores in long antiquity piled up pour forth the rich profusion
open thy maeonian and thy mantuan coffers with whatever else includes thy philosophic thy poetic and thy historical treasures whether with greek or roman characters thou hast chosen to inscribe the ponderous chests give me a while that key to all thy treasures which to thy warburton thou hast entrusted
lastly come experience long conversant with the wise the good the learned and the polite
nor with them only but with every kind of character from the minister at his levee to the bailiff in his spunginghouse from the dutchess at her drum to the landlady behind her bar
from thee only can the manners of mankind be known to which the recluse pedant however great his parts or extensive his learning may be hath ever been a stranger
come all these and more if possible for arduous is the task i have undertaken and without all your assistance will i find be too heavy for me to support
but if you all smile on my labours i hope still to bring them to a happy conclusion
chapter ii
what befel mr jones on his arrival in london
the learned dr misaubin used to say that the proper direction to him was to dr misaubin in the world intimating that there were few people in it to whom his great reputation was not known
and perhaps upon a very nice examination into the matter we shall find that this circumstance bears no inconsiderable part among the many blessings of grandeur
the great happiness of being known to posterity with the hopes of which we so delighted ourselves in the preceding chapter is the portion of few
to have the several elements which compose our names as sydenham expresses it repeated a thousand years hence is a gift beyond the power of title and wealth and is scarce to be purchased unless by the sword and the pen
but to avoid the scandalous imputation while we yet live of being one whom nobody knows a scandal by the bye as old as the days of homer will always be the envied portion of those who have a legal title either to honour or estate
 see the d odyssey ver

from that figure therefore which the irish peer who brought sophia to town hath already made in this history the reader will conclude doubtless it must have been an easy matter to have discovered his house in london without knowing the particular street or square which he inhabited since he must have been one whom everybody knows
to say the truth so it would have been to any of those tradesmen who are accustomed to attend the regions of the great for the doors of the great are generally no less easy to find than it is difficult to get entrance into them
but jones as well as partridge was an entire stranger in london and as he happened to arrive first in a quarter of the town the inhabitants of which have very little intercourse with the householders of hanover or grosvenorsquare for he entered through gray'sinnlane so he rambled about some time before he could even find his way to those happy mansions where fortune segregates from the vulgar those magnanimous heroes the descendants of antient britons saxons or danes whose ancestors being born in better days by sundry kinds of merit have entailed riches and honour on their posterity
jones being at length arrived at those terrestrial elysian fields would now soon have discovered his lordship's mansion but the peer unluckily quitted his former house when he went for ireland and as he was just entered into a new one the fame of his equipage had not yet sufficiently blazed in the neighbourhood so that after a successless enquiry till the clock had struck eleven jones at last yielded to the advice of partridge and retreated to the bull and gate in holborn that being the inn where he had first alighted and where he retired to enjoy that kind of repose which usually attends persons in his circumstances
early in the morning he again set forth in pursuit of sophia and many a weary step he took to no better purpose than before
at last whether it was that fortune relented or whether it was no longer in her power to disappoint him he came into the very street which was honoured by his lordship's residence and being directed to the house he gave one gentle rap at the door
the porter who from the modesty of the knock had conceived no high idea of the person approaching conceived but little better from the appearance of mr jones who was drest in a suit of fustian and had by his side the weapon formerly purchased of the serjeant of which though the blade might be composed of welltempered steel the handle was composed only of brass and that none of the brightest
when jones therefore enquired after the young lady who had come to town with his lordship this fellow answered surlily that there were no ladies there jones then desired to see the master of the house but was informed that his lordship would see nobody that morning
and upon growing more pressing the porter said he had positive orders to let no person in but if you think proper said he to leave your name i will acquaint his lordship and if you call another time you shall know when he will see you  jones now declared that he had very particular business with the young lady and could not depart without seeing her upon which the porter with no very agreeable voice or aspect affirmed that there was no young lady in that house and consequently none could he see  adding sure you are the strangest man i ever met with for you will not take an answer  i have often thought that by the particular description of cerberus the porter of hell in the th aeneid virgil might possibly intend to satirize the porters of the great men in his time the picture at least resembles those who have the honour to attend at the doors of our great men
the porter in his lodge answers exactly to cerberus in his den and like him must be appeased by a sop before access can be gained to his master
perhaps jones might have seen him in that light and have recollected the passage where the sibyl in order to procure an entrance for aeneas presents the keeper of the stygian avenue with such a sop
jones in like manner now began to offer a bribe to the human cerberus which a footman overhearing instantly advanced and declared if mr jones would give him the sum proposed he would conduct him to the lady jones instantly agreed and was forthwith conducted to the lodging of mrs fitzpatrick by the very fellow who had attended the ladies thither the day before
nothing more aggravates ill success than the near approach to good
the gamester who loses his party at piquet by a single point laments his bad luck ten times as much as he who never came within a prospect of the game
so in a lottery the proprietors of the next numbers to that which wins the great prize are apt to account themselves much more unfortunate than their fellowsufferers
in short these kind of hairbreadth missings of happiness look like the insults of fortune who may be considered as thus playing tricks with us and wantonly diverting herself at our expense
jones who more than once already had experienced this frolicsome disposition of the heathen goddess was now again doomed to be tantalized in the like manner for he arrived at the door of mrs fitzpatrick about ten minutes after the departure of sophia
he now addressed himself to the waitingwoman belonging to mrs fitzpatrick who told him the disagreeable news that the lady was gone but could not tell him whither and the same answer he afterwards received from mrs fitzpatrick herself
for as that lady made no doubt but that mr jones was a person detached from her uncle western in pursuit of his daughter so she was too generous to betray her
though jones had never seen mrs fitzpatrick yet he had heard that a cousin of sophia was married to a gentleman of that name
this however in the present tumult of his mind never once recurred to his memory but when the footman who had conducted him from his lordship's acquainted him with the great intimacy between the ladies and with their calling each other cousin he then recollected the story of the marriage which he had formerly heard and as he was presently convinced that this was the same woman he became more surprized at the answer which he had received and very earnestly desired leave to wait on the lady herself but she as positively refused him that honour
jones who though he had never seen a court was better bred than most who frequent it was incapable of any rude or abrupt behaviour to a lady
when he had received therefore a peremptory denial he retired for the present saying to the waitingwoman that if this was an improper hour to wait on her lady he would return in the afternoon and that he then hoped to have the honour of seeing her  the civility with which he uttered this added to the great comeliness of his person made an impression on the waitingwoman and she could not help answering perhaps sir you may and indeed she afterwards said everything to her mistress which she thought most likely to prevail on her to admit a visit from the handsome young gentleman for so she called him
jones very shrewdly suspected that sophia herself was now with her cousin and was denied to him which he imputed to her resentment of what had happened at upton
having therefore dispatched partridge to procure him lodgings he remained all day in the street watching the door where he thought his angel lay concealed but no person did he see issue forth except a servant of the house and in the evening he returned to pay his visit to mrs fitzpatrick which that good lady at last condescended to admit
there is a certain air of natural gentility which it is neither in the power of dress to give nor to conceal
mr jones as hath been before hinted was possessed of this in a very eminent degree
he met therefore with a reception from the lady somewhat different from what his apparel seemed to demand and after he had paid her his proper respects was desired to sit down
the reader will not i believe be desirous of knowing all the particulars of this conversation which ended very little to the satisfaction of poor jones
for though mrs fitzpatrick soon discovered the lover as all women have the eyes of hawks in those matters yet she still thought it was such a lover as a generous friend of the lady should not betray her to
in short she suspected this was the very mr blifil from whom sophia had flown and all the answers which she artfully drew from jones concerning mr allworthy's family confirmed her in this opinion
she therefore strictly denied any knowledge concerning the place whither sophia was gone nor could jones obtain more than a permission to wait on her again the next evening
when jones was departed mrs fitzpatrick communicated her suspicion concerning mr blifil to her maid who answered sure madam he is too pretty a man in my opinion for any woman in the world to run away from
i had rather fancy it is mr jonesmr jones said the lady what jones for sophia had not given the least hint of any such person in all their conversation but mrs honour had been much more communicative and had acquainted her sister abigail with the whole history of jones which this now again related to her mistress
mrs fitzpatrick no sooner received this information than she immediately agreed with the opinion of her maid and what is very unaccountable saw charms in the gallant happy lover which she had overlooked in the slighted squire
betty says she you are certainly in the right he is a very pretty fellow and i don't wonder that my cousin's maid should tell you so many women are fond of him
i am sorry now i did not inform him where my cousin was and yet if he be so terrible a rake as you tell me it is a pity she should ever see him any more for what but her ruin can happen from marrying a rake and a beggar against her father's consent
i protest if he be such a man as the wench described him to you it is but an office of charity to keep her from him and i am sure it would be unpardonable in me to do otherwise who have tasted so bitterly of the misfortunes attending such marriages  here she was interrupted by the arrival of a visitor which was no other than his lordship and as nothing passed at this visit either new or extraordinary or any ways material to this history we shall here put an end to this chapter
chapter iii
a project of mrs fitzpatrick and her visit to lady bellaston
when mrs fitzpatrick retired to rest her thoughts were entirely taken up by her cousin sophia and mr jones
she was indeed a little offended with the former for the disingenuity which she now discovered
in which meditation she had not long exercised her imagination before the following conceit suggested itself that could she possibly become the means of preserving sophia from this man and of restoring her to her father she should in all human probability by so great a service to the family reconcile to herself both her uncle and her aunt western
as this was one of her most favourite wishes so the hope of success seemed so reasonable that nothing remained but to consider of proper methods to accomplish her scheme
to attempt to reason the case with sophia did not appear to her one of those methods for as betty had reported from mrs honour that sophia had a violent inclination to jones she conceived that to dissuade her from the match was an endeavour of the same kind as it would be very heartily and earnestly to entreat a moth not to fly into a candle
if the reader will please to remember that the acquaintance which sophia had with lady bellaston was contracted at the house of mrs western and must have grown at the very time when mrs fitzpatrick lived with this latter lady he will want no information that mrs fitzpatrick must have been acquainted with her likewise
they were besides both equally her distant relations
after much consideration therefore she resolved to go early in the morning to that lady and endeavour to see her unknown to sophia and to acquaint her with the whole affair
for she did not in the least doubt but that the prudent lady who had often ridiculed romantic love and indiscreet marriages in her conversation would very readily concur in her sentiments concerning this match and would lend her utmost assistance to prevent it
this resolution she accordingly executed and the next morning before the sun she huddled on her cloaths and at a very unfashionable unseasonable unvisitable hour went to lady bellaston to whom she got access without the least knowledge or suspicion of sophia who though not asleep lay at that time awake in her bed with honour snoring by her side
mrs fitzpatrick made many apologies for an early abrupt visit at an hour when she said she should not have thought of disturbing her ladyship but upon business of the utmost consequence she then opened the whole affair told all she had heard from betty and did not forget the visit which jones had paid to herself the preceding evening
lady bellaston answered with a smile then you have seen this terrible man madam pray is he so very fine a figure as he is represented
for etoff entertained me last night almost two hours with him
the wench i believe is in love with him by reputation here the reader will be apt to wonder but the truth is that mrs etoff who had the honour to pin and unpin the lady bellaston had received compleat information concerning the said mr jones and had faithfully conveyed the same to her lady last night or rather that morning while she was undressing on which accounts she had been detained in her office above the space of an hour and a half
the lady indeed though generally well enough pleased with the narratives of mrs etoff at those seasons gave an extraordinary attention to her account of jones for honour had described him as a very handsome fellow and mrs etoff in her hurry added so much to the beauty of his person to her report that lady bellaston began to conceive him to be a kind of miracle in nature
the curiosity which her woman had inspired was now greatly increased by mrs fitzpatrick who spoke as much in favour of the person of jones as she had before spoken in dispraise of his birth character and fortune
when lady bellaston had heard the whole she answered gravely indeed madam this is a matter of great consequence
nothing can certainly be more commendable than the part you act and i shall be very glad to have my share in the preservation of a young lady of so much merit and for whom i have so much esteem  doth not your ladyship think says mrs fitzpatrick eagerly that it would be the best way to write immediately to my uncle and acquaint him where my cousin is  the lady pondered a little upon this and thus answeredwhy no madam i think not
di western hath described her brother to me to be such a brute that i cannot consent to put any woman under his power who hath escaped from it
i have heard he behaved like a monster to his own wife for he is one of those wretches who think they have a right to tyrannise over us and from such i shall ever esteem it the cause of my sex to rescue any woman who is so unfortunate to be under their powerthe business dear cousin will be only to keep miss western from seeing this young fellow till the good company which she will have an opportunity of meeting here give her a properer turn  if he should find her out madam answered the other your ladyship may be assured he will leave nothing unattempted to come at her  but madam replied the lady it is impossible he should come herethough indeed it is possible he may get some intelligence where she is and then may lurk about the housei wish therefore i knew his person
is there no way madam by which i could have a sight of him
for otherwise you know cousin she may contrive to see him here without my knowledge mrs fitzpatrick answered that he had threatened her with another visit that afternoon and that if her ladyship pleased to do her the honour of calling upon her then she would hardly fail of seeing him between six and seven and if he came earlier she would by some means or other detain him till her ladyship's arrivallady bellaston replied she would come the moment she could get from dinner which she supposed would be by seven at farthest for that it was absolutely necessary she should be acquainted with his person
upon my word madam says she it was very good to take this care of miss western but common humanity as well as regard to our family requires it of us both for it would be a dreadful match indeed  mrs fitzpatrick failed not to make a proper return to the compliment which lady bellaston had bestowed on her cousin and after some little immaterial conversation withdrew and getting as fast as she could into her chair unseen by sophia or honour returned home
chapter iv
which consists of visiting
mr jones had walked within sight of a certain door during the whole day which though one of the shortest appeared to him to be one of the longest in the whole year
at length the clock having struck five he returned to mrs fitzpatrick who though it was a full hour earlier than the decent time of visiting received him very civilly but still persisted in her ignorance concerning sophia
jones in asking for his angel had dropped the word cousin upon which mrs fitzpatrick said then sir you know we are related and as we are you will permit me the right of enquiring into the particulars of your business with my cousin here jones hesitated a good while and at last answered he had a considerable sum of money of hers in his hands which he desired to deliver to her he then produced the pocketbook and acquainted mrs fitzpatrick with the contents and with the method in which they came into his hands
he had scarce finished his story when a most violent noise shook the whole house
to attempt to describe this noise to those who have heard it would be in vain and to aim at giving any idea of it to those who have never heard the like would be still more vain for it may be truly said                       non acuta      sic geminant corybantes aera       the priests of cybele do not so rattle their sounding brass
in short a footman knocked or rather thundered at the door
jones was a little surprized at the sound having never heard it before but mrs fitzpatrick very calmly said that as some company were coming she could not make him any answer now but if he pleased to stay till they were gone she intimated she had something to say to him
the door of the room now flew open and after pushing in her hoop sideways before her entered lady bellaston who having first made a very low courtesy to mrs fitzpatrick and as low a one to mr jones was ushered to the upper end of the room
we mention these minute matters for the sake of some country ladies of our acquaintance who think it contrary to the rules of modesty to bend their knees to a man
the company were hardly well settled before the arrival of the peer lately mentioned caused a fresh disturbance and a repetition of ceremonials
these being over the conversation began to be as the phrase is extremely brilliant
however as nothing past in it which can be thought material to this history or indeed very material in itself i shall omit the relation the rather as i have known some very fine polite conversation grow extremely dull when transcribed into books or repeated on the stage
indeed this mental repast is a dainty of which those who are excluded from polite assemblies must be contented to remain as ignorant as they must of the several dainties of french cookery which are served only at the tables of the great
to say the truth as neither of these are adapted to every taste they might both be often thrown away on the vulgar
poor jones was rather a spectator of this elegant scene than an actor in it for though in the short interval before the peer's arrival lady bellaston first and afterwards mrs fitzpatrick had addressed some of their discourse to him yet no sooner was the noble lord entered than he engrossed the whole attention of the two ladies to himself and as he took no more notice of jones than if no such person had been present unless by now and then staring at him the ladies followed his example
the company had now staid so long that mrs fitzpatrick plainly perceived they all designed to stay out each other
she therefore resolved to rid herself of jones he being the visitant to whom she thought the least ceremony was due
taking therefore an opportunity of a cessation of chat she addressed herself gravely to him and said sir i shall not possibly be able to give you an answer tonight as to that business but if you please to leave word where i may send to you tomorrow  jones had natural but not artificial goodbreeding
instead therefore of communicating the secret of his lodgings to a servant he acquainted the lady herself with it particularly and soon after very ceremoniously withdrew
he was no sooner gone than the great personages who had taken no notice of him present began to take much notice of him in his absence but if the reader hath already excused us from relating the more brilliant part of this conversation he will surely be very ready to excuse the repetition of what may be called vulgar abuse though perhaps it may be material to our history to mention an observation of lady bellaston who took her leave in a few minutes after him and then said to mrs fitzpatrick at her departure i am satisfied on the account of my cousin she can be in no danger from this fellow  our history shall follow the example of lady bellaston and take leave of the present company which was now reduced to two persons between whom as nothing passed which in the least concerns us or our reader we shall not suffer ourselves to be diverted by it from matters which must seem of more consequence to all those who are at all interested in the affairs of our heroe
chapter v  an adventure which happened to mr jones at his lodgings with some account of a young gentleman who lodged there and of the mistress of the house and her two daughters
the next morning as early as it was decent jones attended at mrs fitzpatrick's door where he was answered that the lady was not at home an answer which surprized him the more as he had walked backwards and forwards in the street from break of day and if she had gone out he must have seen her
this answer however he was obliged to receive and not only now but to five several visits which he made her that day
to be plain with the reader the noble peer had from some reason or other perhaps from a regard for the lady's honour insisted that she should not see mr jones whom he looked on as a scrub any more and the lady had complied in making that promise to which we now see her so strictly adhere
but as our gentle reader may possibly have a better opinion of the young gentleman than her ladyship and may even have some concern should it be apprehended that during this unhappy separation from sophia he took up his residence either at an inn or in the street we shall now give an account of his lodging which was indeed in a very reputable house and in a very good part of the town
mr jones then had often heard mr allworthy mention the gentlewoman at whose house he used to lodge when he was in town
this person who as jones likewise knew lived in bondstreet was the widow of a clergyman and was left by him at his decease in possession of two daughters and of a compleat set of manuscript sermons
of these two daughters nancy the elder was now arrived at the age of seventeen and betty the younger at that of ten
hither jones had despatched partridge and in this house he was provided with a room for himself in the second floor and with one for partridge in the fourth
the first floor was inhabited by one of those young gentlemen who in the last age were called men of wit and pleasure about town and properly enough for as men are usually denominated from their business or profession so pleasure may be said to have been the only business or profession of those gentlemen to whom fortune had made all useful occupations unnecessary
playhouses coffeehouses and taverns were the scenes of their rendezvous
wit and humour were the entertainment of their looser hours and love was the business of their more serious moments
wine and the muses conspired to kindle the brightest flames in their breasts nor did they only admire but some were able to celebrate the beauty they admired and all to judge of the merit of such compositions
such therefore were properly called the men of wit and pleasure but i question whether the same appellation may with the same propriety be given to those young gentlemen of our times who have the same ambition to be distinguished for parts
wit certainly they have nothing to do with
to give them their due they soar a step higher than their predecessors and may be called men of wisdom and vert take heed you do not read virtue
thus at an age when the gentlemen above mentioned employ their time in toasting the charms of a woman or in making sonnets in her praise in giving their opinion of a play at the theatre or of a poem at will's or button's these gentlemen are considering the methods to bribe a corporation or meditating speeches for the house of commons or rather for the magazines
but the science of gaming is that which above all others employs their thoughts
these are the studies of their graver hours while for their amusements they have the vast circle of connoisseurship painting music statuary and natural philosophy or rather unnatural which deals in the wonderful and knows nothing of nature except her monsters and imperfections
when jones had spent the whole day in vain enquiries after mrs fitzpatrick he returned at last disconsolate to his apartment
here while he was venting his grief in private he heard a violent uproar belowstairs and soon after a female voice begged him for heaven's sake to come and prevent murder
jones who was never backward on any occasion to help the distressed immediately ran downstairs when stepping into the diningroom whence all the noise issued he beheld the young gentleman of wisdom and vert just before mentioned pinned close to the wall by his footman and a young woman standing by wringing her hands and crying out he will be murdered
he will be murdered and indeed the poor gentleman seemed in some danger of being choaked when jones flew hastily to his assistance and rescued him just as he was breathing his last from the unmerciful clutches of the enemy
though the fellow had received several kicks and cuffs from the little gentleman who had more spirit than strength he had made it a kind of scruple of conscience to strike his master and would have contented himself with only choaking him but towards jones he bore no such respect he no sooner therefore found himself a little roughly handled by his new antagonist than he gave him one of those punches in the guts which though the spectators at broughton's amphitheatre have such exquisite delight in seeing them convey but very little pleasure in the feeling
the lusty youth had no sooner received this blow than he meditated a most grateful return and now ensued a combat between jones and the footman which was very fierce but short for this fellow was no more able to contend with jones than his master had before been to contend with him
and now fortune according to her usual custom reversed the face of affairs
the former victor lay breathless on the ground and the vanquished gentleman had recovered breath enough to thank mr jones for his seasonable assistance he received likewise the hearty thanks of the young woman present who was indeed no other than miss nancy the eldest daughter of the house
the footman having now recovered his legs shook his head at jones and with a sagacious look criedo dn me i'll have nothing more to do with you you have been upon the stage or i'm dnably mistaken and indeed we may forgive this his suspicion for such was the agility and strength of our heroe that he was perhaps a match for one of the firstrate boxers and could with great ease have beaten all the muffled graduates of mr broughton's school
 lest posterity should be puzzled by this epithet i think proper   to explain it by an advertisement which was published feb  
nbmr broughton proposes with proper assistance to open an   academy at his house in the haymarket for the instruction of those   who are willing to be initiated in the mystery of boxing where the   whole theory and practice of that truly british art with all the   various stops blows crossbuttocks c incident to combatants   will be fully taught and explained and that persons of quality and   distinction may not be deterred from entering into a course of   those lectures they will be given with the utmost tenderness and   regard to the delicacy of the frame and constitution of the pupil   for which reason muffles are provided that will effectually secure   them from the inconveniency of black eyes broken jaws and bloody   noses
the master foaming with wrath ordered his man immediately to strip to which the latter very readily agreed on condition of receiving his wages
this condition was presently complied with and the fellow was discharged
and now the young gentleman whose name was nightingale very strenuously insisted that his deliverer should take part of a bottle of wine with him to which jones after much entreaty consented though more out of complacence than inclination for the uneasiness of his mind fitted him very little for conversation at this time
miss nancy likewise who was the only female then in the house her mamma and sister being both gone to the play condescended to favour them with her company
when the bottle and glasses were on the table the gentleman began to relate the occasion of the preceding disturbance
i hope sir said he to jones you will not from this accident conclude that i make a custom of striking my servants for i assure you this is the first time i have been guilty of it in my remembrance and i have passed by many provoking faults in this very fellow before he could provoke me to it but when you hear what hath happened this evening you will i believe think me excusable
i happened to come home several hours before my usual time when i found four gentlemen of the cloth at whist by my fireand my hoyle sirmy best hoyle which cost me a guinea lying open on the table with a quantity of porter spilt on one of the most material leaves of the whole book
this you will allow was provoking but i said nothing till the rest of the honest company were gone and then gave the fellow a gentle rebuke who instead of expressing any concern made me a pert answer that servants must have their diversions as well as other people that he was sorry for the accident which had happened to the book but that several of his acquaintance had bought the same for a shilling and that i might stop as much in his wages if i pleased'
i now gave him a severer reprimand than before when the rascal had the insolence toin short he imputed my early coming home toin short he cast a reflectionhe mentioned the name of a young lady in a mannerin such a manner that incensed me beyond all patience and in my passion i struck him  jones answered that he believed no person living would blame him for my part said he i confess i should on the lastmentioned provocation have done the same thing  our company had not sat long before they were joined by the mother and daughter at their return from the play
and now they all spent a very chearful evening together for all but jones were heartily merry and even he put on as much constrained mirth as possible
indeed half his natural flow of animal spirits joined to the sweetness of his temper was sufficient to make a most amiable companion and notwithstanding the heaviness of his heart so agreeable did he make himself on the present occasion that at their breaking up the young gentleman earnestly desired his further acquaintance
miss nancy was well pleased with him and the widow quite charmed with her new lodger invited him with the other next morning to breakfast
jones on his part was no less satisfied
as for miss nancy though a very little creature she was extremely pretty and the widow had all the charms which can adorn a woman near fifty
as she was one of the most innocent creatures in the world so she was one of the most chearful
she never thought nor spoke nor wished any ill and had constantly that desire of pleasing which may be called the happiest of all desires in this that it scarce ever fails of attaining its ends when not disgraced by affectation
in short though her power was very small she was in her heart one of the warmest friends
she had been a most affectionate wife and was a most fond and tender mother
as our history doth not like a newspaper give great characters to people who never were heard of before nor will ever be heard of again the reader may hence conclude that this excellent woman will hereafter appear to be of some importance in our history
nor was jones a little pleased with the young gentleman himself whose wine he had been drinking
he thought he discerned in him much good sense though a little too much tainted with townfoppery but what recommended him most to jones were some sentiments of great generosity and humanity which occasionally dropt from him and particularly many expressions of the highest disinterestedness in the affair of love
on which subject the young gentleman delivered himself in a language which might have very well become an arcadian shepherd of old and which appeared very extraordinary when proceeding from the lips of a modern fine gentleman but he was only one by imitation and meant by nature for a much better character
chapter vi
what arrived while the company were at breakfast with some hints concerning the government of daughters
our company brought together in the morning the same good inclinations towards each other with which they had separated the evening before but poor jones was extremely disconsolate for he had just received information from partridge that mrs fitzpatrick had left her lodging and that he could not learn whither she was gone
this news highly afflicted him and his countenance as well as his behaviour in defiance of all his endeavours to the contrary betrayed manifest indications of a disordered mind
the discourse turned at present as before on love and mr nightingale again expressed many of those warm generous and disinterested sentiments upon this subject which wise and sober men call romantic but which wise and sober women generally regard in a better light
mrs miller for so the mistress of the house was called greatly approved these sentiments but when the young gentleman appealed to miss nancy she answered only that she believed the gentleman who had spoke the least was capable of feeling most  this compliment was so apparently directed to jones that we should have been sorry had he passed it by unregarded
he made her indeed a very polite answer and concluded with an oblique hint that her own silence subjected her to a suspicion of the same kind for indeed she had scarce opened her lips either now or the last evening
i am glad nanny says mrs miller the gentleman hath made the observation i protest i am almost of his opinion
what can be the matter with you child
i never saw such an alteration
what is become of all your gaiety
would you think sir i used to call her my little prattler
she hath not spoke twenty words this week  here their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a maidservant who brought a bundle in her hand which she said was delivered by a porter for mr jones she added that the man immediately went away saying it required no answer  jones expressed some surprize on this occasion and declared it must be some mistake but the maid persisting that she was certain of the name all the women were desirous of having the bundle immediately opened which operation was at length performed by little betsy with the consent of mr jones and the contents were found to be a domino a mask and a masquerade ticket
jones was now more positive than ever in asserting that these things must have been delivered by mistake and mrs miller herself expressed some doubt and said she knew not what to think but when mr nightingale was asked he delivered a very different opinion
all i can conclude from it sir said he is that you are a very happy man for i make no doubt but these were sent you by some lady whom you will have the happiness of meeting at the masquerade  jones had not a sufficient degree of vanity to entertain any such flattering imagination nor did mrs miller herself give much assent to what mr nightingale had said till miss nancy having lifted up the domino a card dropt from the sleeve in which was written as follows       to mr jones
the queen of the fairies sends you this      use her favours not amiss
mrs miller and miss nancy now both agreed with mr nightingale nay jones himself was almost persuaded to be of the same opinion
and as no other lady but mrs fitzpatrick he thought knew his lodging he began to flatter himself with some hopes that it came from her and that he might possibly see his sophia
these hopes had surely very little foundation but as the conduct of mrs fitzpatrick in not seeing him according to her promise and in quitting her lodgings had been very odd and unaccountable he conceived some faint hopes that she of whom he had formerly heard a very whimsical character might possibly intend to do him that service in a strange manner which she declined doing by more ordinary methods
to say the truth as nothing certain could be concluded from so odd and uncommon an incident he had the greater latitude to draw what imaginary conclusions from it he pleased
as his temper therefore was naturally sanguine he indulged it on this occasion and his imagination worked up a thousand conceits to favour and support his expectations of meeting his dear sophia in the evening
reader if thou hast any good wishes towards me i will fully repay them by wishing thee to be possessed of this sanguine disposition of mind since after having read much and considered long on that subject of happiness which hath employed so many great pens i am almost inclined to fix it in the possession of this temper which puts us in a manner out of the reach of fortune and makes us happy without her assistance
indeed the sensations of pleasure it gives are much more constant as well as much keener than those which that blind lady bestows nature having wisely contrived that some satiety and languor should be annexed to all our real enjoyments lest we should be so taken up by them as to be stopt from further pursuits
i make no manner of doubt but that in this light we may see the imaginary future chancellor just called to the bar the archbishop in crape and the prime minister at the tail of an opposition more truly happy than those who are invested with all the power and profit of those respective offices
mr jones having now determined to go to the masquerade that evening mr nightingale offered to conduct him thither
the young gentleman at the same time offered tickets to miss nancy and her mother but the good woman would not accept them
she said she did not conceive the harm which some people imagined in a masquerade but that such extravagant diversions were proper only for persons of quality and fortune and not for young women who were to get their living and could at best hope to be married to a good tradesmana tradesman cries nightingale you shan't undervalue my nancy
there is not a nobleman upon earth above her merit o fie
mr nightingale answered mrs miller you must not fill the girl's head with such fancies but if it was her good luck says the mother with a simper to find a gentleman of your generous way of thinking i hope she would make a better return to his generosity than to give her mind up to extravagant pleasures
indeed where young ladies bring great fortunes themselves they have some right to insist on spending what is their own and on that account i have heard the gentlemen say a man has sometimes a better bargain with a poor wife than with a rich onebut let my daughters marry whom they will i shall endeavour to make them blessings to their husbandsi beg therefore i may hear of no more masquerades
nancy is i am certain too good a girl to desire to go for she must remember when you carried her thither last year it almost turned her head and she did not return to herself or to her needle in a month afterwards  though a gentle sigh which stole from the bosom of nancy seemed to argue some secret disapprobation of these sentiments she did not dare openly to oppose them
for as this good woman had all the tenderness so she had preserved all the authority of a parent and as her indulgence to the desires of her children was restrained only by her fears for their safety and future welfare so she never suffered those commands which proceeded from such fears to be either disobeyed or disputed
and this the young gentleman who had lodged two years in the house knew so well that he presently acquiesced in the refusal
mr nightingale who grew every minute fonder of jones was very desirous of his company that day to dinner at the tavern where he offered to introduce him to some of his acquaintance but jones begged to be excused as his cloaths he said were not yet come to town  to confess the truth mr jones was now in a situation which sometimes happens to be the case of young gentlemen of much better figure than himself
in short he had not one penny in his pocket a situation in much greater credit among the antient philosophers than among the modern wise men who live in lombardstreet or those who frequent white's chocolatehouse
and perhaps the great honours which those philosophers have ascribed to an empty pocket may be one of the reasons of that high contempt in which they are held in the aforesaid street and chocolatehouse
now if the antient opinion that men might live very comfortably on virtue only be as the modern wise men just abovementioned pretend to have discovered a notorious error no less false is i apprehend that position of some writers of romance that a man can live altogether on love for however delicious repasts this may afford to some of our senses or appetites it is most certain it can afford none to others
those therefore who have placed too great a confidence in such writers have experienced their error when it was too late and have found that love was no more capable of allaying hunger than a rose is capable of delighting the ear or a violin of gratifying the smell
notwithstanding therefore all the delicacies which love had set before him namely the hopes of seeing sophia at the masquerade on which however illfounded his imagination might be he had voluptuously feasted during the whole day the evening no sooner came than mr jones began to languish for some food of a grosser kind
partridge discovered this by intuition and took the occasion to give some oblique hints concerning the bankbill and when these were rejected with disdain he collected courage enough once more to mention a return to mr allworthy
partridge cries jones you cannot see my fortune in a more desperate light than i see it myself and i begin heartily to repent that i suffered you to leave a place where you was settled and to follow me
however i insist now on your returning home and for the expense and trouble which you have so kindly put yourself to on my account all the cloaths i left behind in your care i desire you would take as your own
i am sorry i can make you no other acknowledgment  he spoke these words with so pathetic an accent that partridge among whose vices illnature or hardness of heart were not numbered burst into tears and after swearing he would not quit him in his distress he began with the most earnest entreaties to urge his return home
for heaven's sake sir says he do but consider what can your honour dohow is it possible you can live in this town without money
do what you will sir or go wherever you please i am resolved not to desert you
but pray sir considerdo pray sir for your own sake take it into your consideration and i'm sure says he that your own good sense will bid you return home  how often shall i tell thee answered jones that i have no home to return to
had i any hopes that mr allworthy's doors would be open to receive me i want no distress to urge menay there is no other cause upon earth which could detain me a moment from flying to his presence but alas
that i am for ever banished from
his last words wereo partridge they still ring in my earshis last words were when he gave me a sum of moneywhat it was i know not but considerable i'm sure it washis last words werei am resolved from this day forward on no account to converse with you any more
'  here passion stopt the mouth of jones as surprize for a moment did that of partridge but he soon recovered the use of speech and after a short preface in which he declared he had no inquisitiveness in his temper enquired what jones meant by a considerable sumhe knew not how muchand what was become of the money
in both these points he now received full satisfaction on which he was proceeding to comment when he was interrupted by a message from mr nightingale who desired his master's company in his apartment
when the two gentlemen were both attired for the masquerade and mr nightingale had given orders for chairs to be sent for a circumstance of distress occurred to jones which will appear very ridiculous to many of my readers
this was how to procure a shilling but if such readers will reflect a little on what they have themselves felt from the want of a thousand pounds or perhaps of ten or twenty to execute a favourite scheme they will have a perfect idea of what mr jones felt on this occasion
for this sum therefore he applied to partridge which was the first he had permitted him to advance and was the last he intended that poor fellow should advance in his service
to say the truth partridge had lately made no offer of this kind
whether it was that he desired to see the bankbill broke in upon or that distress should prevail on jones to return home or from what other motive it proceeded i will not determine
chapter vii
containing the whole humours of a masquerade
our cavaliers now arrived at that temple where heydegger the great arbiter deliciarum the great highpriest of pleasure presides and like other heathen priests imposes on his votaries by the pretended presence of the deity when in reality no such deity is there
mr nightingale having taken a turn or two with his companion soon left him and walked off with a female saying now you are here sir you must beat about for your own game  jones began to entertain strong hopes that his sophia was present and these hopes gave him more spirits than the lights the music and the company though these are pretty strong antidotes against the spleen
he now accosted every woman he saw whose stature shape or air bore any resemblance to his angel
to all of whom he endeavoured to say something smart in order to engage an answer by which he might discover that voice which he thought it impossible he should mistake
some of these answered by a question in a squeaking voice do you know me
much the greater number said i don't know you sir and nothing more
some called him an impertinent fellow some made him no answer at all some said indeed i don't know your voice and i shall have nothing to say to you and many gave him as kind answers as he could wish but not in the voice he desired to hear
whilst he was talking with one of these last who was in the habit of a shepherdess a lady in a domino came up to him and slapping him on the shoulder whispered him at the same time in the ear if you talk any longer with that trollop i will acquaint miss western  jones no sooner heard that name than immediately quitting his former companion he applied to the domino begging and entreating her to show him the lady she had mentioned if she was then in the room
the mask walked hastily to the upper end of the innermost apartment before she spoke and then instead of answering him sat down and declared she was tired
jones sat down by her and still persisted in his entreaties at last the lady coldly answered i imagined mr jones had been a more discerning lover than to suffer any disguise to conceal his mistress from him is she here then madam replied jones with some vehemence
upon which the lady criedhush sir you will be observed
i promise you upon my honour miss western is not here  jones now taking the mask by the hand fell to entreating her in the most earnest manner to acquaint him where he might find sophia and when he could obtain no direct answer he began to upbraid her gently for having disappointed him the day before and concluded saying indeed my good fairy queen i know your majesty very well notwithstanding the affected disguise of your voice
indeed mrs fitzpatrick it is a little cruel to divert yourself at the expense of my torments  the mask answered though you have so ingeniously discovered me i must still speak in the same voice lest i should be known by others
and do you think good sir that i have no greater regard for my cousin than to assist in carrying on an affair between you two which must end in her ruin as well as your own
besides i promise you my cousin is not mad enough to consent to her own destruction if you are so much her enemy as to tempt her to it  alas madam said jones you little know my heart when you call me an enemy of sophia  and yet to ruin any one cries the other you will allow is the act of an enemy and when by the same act you must knowingly and certainly bring ruin on yourself is it not folly or madness as well as guilt
now sir my cousin hath very little more than her father will please to give her very little for one of her fashionyou know him and you know your own situation  jones vowed he had no such design on sophia that he would rather suffer the most violent of deaths than sacrifice her interest to his desires he said he knew how unworthy he was of her every way that he had long ago resolved to quit all such aspiring thoughts but that some strange accidents had made him desirous to see her once more when he promised he would take leave of her for ever
no madam concluded he my love is not of that base kind which seeks its own satisfaction at the expense of what is most dear to its object
i would sacrifice everything to the possession of my sophia but sophia herself  though the reader may have already conceived no very sublime idea of the virtue of the lady in the mask and though possibly she may hereafter appear not to deserve one of the first characters of her sex yet it is certain these generous sentiments made a strong impression upon her and greatly added to the affection she had before conceived for our young heroe
the lady now after silence of a few moments said she did not see his pretensions to sophia so much in the light of presumption as of imprudence
young fellows says she can never have too aspiring thoughts
i love ambition in a young man and i would have you cultivate it as much as possible
perhaps you may succeed with those who are infinitely superior in fortune nay i am convinced there are womenbut don't you think me a strange creature mr jones to be thus giving advice to a man with whom i am so little acquainted and one with whose behaviour to me i have so little reason to be pleased  here jones began to apologize and to hope he had not offended in anything he had said of her cousinto which the mask answered and are you so little versed in the sex to imagine you can well affront a lady more than by entertaining her with your passion for another woman
if the fairy queen had conceived no better opinion of your gallantry she would scarce have appointed you to meet her at the masquerade  jones had never less inclination to an amour than at present but gallantry to the ladies was among his principles of honour and he held it as much incumbent on him to accept a challenge to love as if it had been a challenge to fight
nay his very love to sophia made it necessary for him to keep well with the lady as he made no doubt but she was capable of bringing him into the presence of the other
he began therefore to make a very warm answer to her last speech when a mask in the character of an old woman joined them
this mask was one of those ladies who go to a masquerade only to vent illnature by telling people rude truths and by endeavouring as the phrase is to spoil as much sport as they are able
this good lady therefore having observed jones and his friend whom she well knew in close consultation together in a corner of the room concluded she could nowhere satisfy her spleen better than by interrupting them
she attacked them therefore and soon drove them from their retirement nor was she contented with this but pursued them to every place which they shifted to avoid her till mr nightingale seeing the distress of his friend at last relieved him and engaged the old woman in another pursuit
while jones and his mask were walking together about the room to rid themselves of the teazer he observed his lady speak to several masks with the same freedom of acquaintance as if they had been barefaced
he could not help expressing his surprize at this saying sure madam you must have infinite discernment to know people in all disguises to which the lady answered you cannot conceive anything more insipid and childish than a masquerade to the people of fashion who in general know one another as well here as when they meet in an assembly or a drawingroom nor will any woman of condition converse with a person with whom she is not acquainted
in short the generality of persons whom you see here may more properly be said to kill time in this place than in any other and generally retire from hence more tired than from the longest sermon
to say the truth i begin to be in that situation myself and if i have any faculty at guessing you are not much better pleased
i protest it would be almost charity in me to go home for your sake i know but one charity equal to it cries jones and that is to suffer me to wait on you home sure answered the lady you have a strange opinion of me to imagine that upon such an acquaintance i would let you into my doors at this time of night
i fancy you impute the friendship i have shown my cousin to some other motive
confess honestly don't you consider this contrived interview as little better than a downright assignation
are you used mr jones to make these sudden conquests i am not used madam said jones to submit to such sudden conquests but as you have taken my heart by surprize the rest of my body hath a right to follow so you must pardon me if i resolve to attend you wherever you go he accompanied these words with some proper actions upon which the lady after a gentle rebuke and saying their familiarity would be observed told him she was going to sup with an acquaintance whither she hoped he would not follow her for if you should said she i shall be thought an unaccountable creature though my friend indeed is not censorious yet i hope you won't follow me i protest i shall not know what to say if you do  the lady presently after quitted the masquerade and jones notwithstanding the severe prohibition he had received presumed to attend her
he was now reduced to the same dilemma we have mentioned before namely the want of a shilling and could not relieve it by borrowing as before
he therefore walked boldly on after the chair in which his lady rode pursued by a grand huzza from all the chairmen present who wisely take the best care they can to discountenance all walking afoot by their betters
luckily however the gentry who attend at the operahouse were too busy to quit their stations and as the lateness of the hour prevented him from meeting many of their brethren in the street he proceeded without molestation in a dress which at another season would have certainly raised a mob at his heels
the lady was set down in a street not far from hanoversquare where the door being presently opened she was carried in and the gentleman without any ceremony walked in after her
jones and his companion were now together in a very wellfurnished and wellwarmed room when the female still speaking in her masquerade voice said she was surprized at her friend who must absolutely have forgot her appointment at which after venting much resentment she suddenly exprest some apprehension from jones and asked him what the world would think of their having been alone together in a house at that time of night
but instead of a direct answer to so important a question jones began to be very importunate with the lady to unmask and at length having prevailed there appeared not mrs fitzpatrick but the lady bellaston herself
it would be tedious to give the particular conversation which consisted of very common and ordinary occurrences and which lasted from two till six o'clock in the morning
it is sufficient to mention all of it that is anywise material to this history
and this was a promise that the lady would endeavour to find out sophia and in a few days bring him to an interview with her on condition that he would then take his leave of her
when this was thoroughly settled and a second meeting in the evening appointed at the same place they separated the lady returned to her house and jones to his lodgings
chapter viii
containing a scene of distress which will appear very extraordinary to most of our readers
jones having refreshed himself with a few hours' sleep summoned partridge to his presence and delivering him a banknote of fifty pounds ordered him to go and change it
partridge received this with sparkling eyes though when he came to reflect farther it raised in him some suspicions not very advantageous to the honour of his master to these the dreadful idea he had of the masquerade the disguise in which his master had gone out and returned and his having been abroad all night contributed
in plain language the only way he could possibly find to account for the possession of this note was by robbery and to confess the truth the reader unless he should suspect it was owing to the generosity of lady bellaston can hardly imagine any other
to clear therefore the honour of mr jones and to do justice to the liberality of the lady he had really received this present from her who though she did not give much into the hackney charities of the age such as building hospitals c was not however entirely void of that christian virtue and conceived very rightly i think that a young fellow of merit without a shilling in the world was no improper object of this virtue
mr jones and mr nightingale had been invited to dine this day with mrs miller
at the appointed hour therefore the two young gentlemen with the two girls attended in the parlour where they waited from three till almost five before the good woman appeared
she had been out of town to visit a relation of whom at her return she gave the following account
i hope gentlemen you will pardon my making you wait i am sure if you knew the occasioni have been to see a cousin of mine about six miles off who now lies init should be a warning to all persons says she looking at her daughters how they marry indiscreetly
there is no happiness in this world without a competency
o nancy
how shall i describe the wretched condition in which i found your poor cousin
she hath scarce lain in a week and there was she this dreadful weather in a cold room without any curtains to her bed and not a bushel of coals in her house to supply her with fire her second son that sweet little fellow lies ill of a quinzy in the same bed with his mother for there is no other bed in the house
poor little tommy
i believe nancy you will never see your favourite any more for he is really very ill
the rest of the children are in pretty good health but molly i am afraid will do herself an injury she is but thirteen years old mr nightingale and yet in my life i never saw a better nurse she tends both her mother and her brother and what is wonderful in a creature so young she shows all the chearfulness in the world to her mother and yet i saw heri saw the poor child mr nightingale turn about and privately wipe the tears from her eyes  here mrs miller was prevented by her own tears from going on and there was not i believe a person present who did not accompany her in them at length she a little recovered herself and proceeded thus in all this distress the mother supports her spirits in a surprizing manner
the danger of her son sits heaviest upon her and yet she endeavours as much as possible to conceal even this concern on her husband's account
her grief however sometimes gets the better of all her endeavours for she was always extravagantly fond of this boy and a most sensible sweettempered creature it is
i protest i was never more affected in my life than when i heard the little wretch who is hardly yet seven years old while his mother was wetting him with her tears beg her to be comforted
indeed mamma' cried the child i shan't die god almighty i'm sure won't take tommy away let heaven be ever so fine a place i had rather stay here and starve with you and my papa than go to it'
pardon me gentlemen i can't help it says she wiping her eyes such sensibility and affection in a childand yet perhaps he is least the object of pity for a day or two will most probably place him beyond the reach of all human evils
the father is indeed most worthy of compassion
poor man his countenance is the very picture of horror and he looks like one rather dead than alive
oh heavens
what a scene did i behold at my first coming into the room
the good creature was lying behind the bolster supporting at once both his child and his wife
he had nothing on but a thin waistcoat for his coat was spread over the bed to supply the want of blanketswhen he rose up at my entrance i scarce knew him
as comely a man mr jones within this fortnight as you ever beheld mr nightingale hath seen him
his eyes sunk his face pale with a long beard
his body shivering with cold and worn with hunger too for my cousin says she can hardly prevail upon him to eathe told me himself in a whisperhe told mei can't repeat ithe said he could not bear to eat the bread his children wanted
and yet can you believe it gentlemen
in all this misery his wife has as good caudle as if she lay in the midst of the greatest affluence i tasted it and i scarce ever tasted betterthe means of procuring her this he said he believed was sent him by an angel from heaven
i know not what he meant for i had not spirits enough to ask a single question
this was a lovematch as they call it on both sides that is a match between two beggars
i must indeed say i never saw a fonder couple but what is their fondness good for but to torment each other indeed mamma cries nancy i have always looked on my cousin anderson for that was her name as one of the happiest of women i am sure says mrs miller the case at present is much otherwise for any one might have discerned that the tender consideration of each other's sufferings makes the most intolerable part of their calamity both to the husband and wife
compared to which hunger and cold as they affect their own persons only are scarce evils
nay the very children the youngest which is not two years old excepted feel in the same manner for they are a most loving family and if they had but a bare competency would be the happiest people in the world i never saw the least sign of misery at her house replied nancy i am sure my heart bleeds for what you now tell meo child answered the mother she hath always endeavoured to make the best of everything
they have always been in great distress but indeed this absolute ruin hath been brought upon them by others
the poor man was bail for the villain his brother and about a week ago the very day before her lyingin their goods were all carried away and sold by an execution
he sent a letter to me of it by one of the bailiffs which the villain never deliveredwhat must he think of my suffering a week to pass before he heard of me  it was not with dry eyes that jones heard this narrative when it was ended he took mrs miller apart with him into another room and delivering her his purse in which was the sum of  desired her to send as much of it as she thought proper to these poor people
the look which mrs miller gave jones on this occasion is not easy to be described
she burst into a kind of agony of transport and cryed outgood heavens
is there such a man in the worldbut recollecting herself she said indeed i know one such but can there be another i hope madam cries jones there are many who have common humanity for to relieve such distresses in our fellowcreatures can hardly be called more mrs miller then took ten guineas which were the utmost he could prevail with her to accept and said she would find some means of conveying them early the next morning  adding that she had herself done some little matter for the poor people and had not left them in quite so much misery as she found them  they then returned to the parlour where nightingale expressed much concern at the dreadful situation of these wretches whom indeed he knew for he had seen them more than once at mrs miller's
he inveighed against the folly of making oneself liable for the debts of others vented many bitter execrations against the brother and concluded with wishing something could be done for the unfortunate family
suppose madam said he you should recommend them to mr allworthy
or what think you of a collection
i will give them a guinea with all my heart  mrs miller made no answer and nancy to whom her mother had whispered the generosity of jones turned pale upon the occasion though if either of them was angry with nightingale it was surely without reason
for the liberality of jones if he had known it was not an example which he had any obligation to follow and there are thousands who would not have contributed a single halfpenny as indeed he did not in effect for he made no tender of anything and therefore as the others thought proper to make no demand he kept his money in his pocket
i have in truth observed and shall never have a better opportunity than at present to communicate my observation that the world are in general divided into two opinions concerning charity which are the very reverse of each other
one party seems to hold that all acts of this kind are to be esteemed as voluntary gifts and however little you give if indeed no more than your good wishes you acquire a great degree of merit in so doing
others on the contrary appear to be as firmly persuaded that beneficence is a positive duty and that whenever the rich fall greatly short of their ability in relieving the distresses of the poor their pitiful largesses are so far from being meritorious that they have only performed their duty by halves and are in some sense more contemptible than those who have entirely neglected it
to reconcile these different opinions is not in my power
i shall only add that the givers are generally of the former sentiment and the receivers are almost universally inclined to the latter
chapter ix
which treats of matters of a very different kind from those in the preceding chapter
in the evening jones met his lady again and a long conversation again ensued between them but as it consisted only of the same ordinary occurrences as before we shall avoid mentioning particulars which we despair of rendering agreeable to the reader unless he is one whose devotion to the fair sex like that of the papists to their saints wants to be raised by the help of pictures
but i am so far from desiring to exhibit such pictures to the public that i would wish to draw a curtain over those that have been lately set forth in certain french novels very bungling copies of which have been presented us here under the name of translations
jones grew still more and more impatient to see sophia and finding after repeated interviews with lady bellaston no likelihood of obtaining this by her means for on the contrary the lady began to treat even the mention of the name of sophia with resentment he resolved to try some other method
he made no doubt but that lady bellaston knew where his angel was so he thought it most likely that some of her servants should be acquainted with the same secret
partridge therefore was employed to get acquainted with those servants in order to fish this secret out of them
few situations can be imagined more uneasy than that to which his poor master was at present reduced for besides the difficulties he met with in discovering sophia besides the fears he had of having disobliged her and the assurances he had received from lady bellaston of the resolution which sophia had taken against him and of her having purposely concealed herself from him which he had sufficient reason to believe might be true he had still a difficulty to combat which it was not in the power of his mistress to remove however kind her inclination might have been
this was the exposing of her to be disinherited of all her father's estate the almost inevitable consequence of their coming together without a consent which he had no hopes of ever obtaining
add to all these the many obligations which lady bellaston whose violent fondness we can no longer conceal had heaped upon him so that by her means he was now become one of the bestdressed men about town and was not only relieved from those ridiculous distresses we have before mentioned but was actually raised to a state of affluence beyond what he had ever known
now though there are many gentlemen who very well reconcile it to their consciences to possess themselves of the whole fortune of a woman without making her any kind of return yet to a mind the proprietor of which doth not deserved to be hanged nothing is i believe more irksome than to support love with gratitude only especially where inclination pulls the heart a contrary way
such was the unhappy case of jones for though the virtuous love he bore to sophia and which left very little affection for any other woman had been entirely out of the question he could never have been able to have made any adequate return to the generous passion of this lady who had indeed been once an object of desire but was now entered at least into the autumn of life though she wore all the gaiety of youth both in her dress and manner nay she contrived still to maintain the roses in her cheeks but these like flowers forced out of season by art had none of that lively blooming freshness with which nature at the proper time bedecks her own productions
she had besides a certain imperfection which renders some flowers though very beautiful to the eye very improper to be placed in a wilderness of sweets and what above all others is most disagreeable to the breath of love
though jones saw all these discouragements on the one side he felt his obligations full as strongly on the other nor did he less plainly discern the ardent passion whence those obligations proceeded the extreme violence of which if he failed to equal he well knew the lady would think him ungrateful and what is worse he would have thought himself so
he knew the tacit consideration upon which all her favours were conferred and as his necessity obliged him to accept them so his honour he concluded forced him to pay the price
this therefore he resolved to do whatever misery it cost him and to devote himself to her from that great principle of justice by which the laws of some countries oblige a debtor who is no otherwise capable of discharging his debt to become the slave of his creditor
while he was meditating on these matters he received the following note from the lady    a very foolish but a very perverse accident hath happened since   our last meeting which makes it improper i should see you any more   at the usual place
i will if possible contrive some other place   by tomorrow
in the meantime adieu  this disappointment perhaps the reader may conclude was not very great but if it was he was quickly relieved for in less than an hour afterwards another note was brought him from the same hand which contained as follows    i have altered my mind since i wrote a change which if you are no   stranger to the tenderest of all passions you will not wonder at
i   am now resolved to see you this evening at my own house whatever   may be the consequence
come to me exactly at seven i dine abroad   but will be at home by that time
a day i find to those that   sincerely love seems longer than i imagined
if you should accidentally be a few moments before me bid them   show you into the drawingroom  to confess the truth jones was less pleased with this last epistle than he had been with the former as he was prevented by it from complying with the earnest entreaties of mr nightingale with whom he had now contracted much intimacy and friendship
these entreaties were to go with that young gentleman and his company to a new play which was to be acted that evening and which a very large party had agreed to damn from some dislike they had taken to the author who was a friend to one of mr nightingale's acquaintance
and this sort of fun our heroe we are ashamed to confess would willingly have preferred to the above kind appointment but his honour got the better of his inclination
before we attend him to this intended interview with the lady we think proper to account for both the preceding notes as the reader may possibly be not a little surprized at the imprudence of lady bellaston in bringing her lover to the very house where her rival was lodged
first then the mistress of the house where these lovers had hitherto met and who had been for some years a pensioner to that lady was now become a methodist and had that very morning waited upon her ladyship and after rebuking her very severely for her past life had positively declared that she would on no account be instrumental in carrying on any of her affairs for the future
the hurry of spirits into which this accident threw the lady made her despair of possibly finding any other convenience to meet jones that evening but as she began a little to recover from her uneasiness at the disappointment she set her thoughts to work when luckily it came into her head to propose to sophia to go to the play which was immediately consented to and a proper lady provided for her companion
mrs honour was likewise despatched with mrs etoff on the same errand of pleasure and thus her own house was left free for the safe reception of mr jones with whom she promised herself two or three hours of uninterrupted conversation after her return from the place where she dined which was at a friend's house in a pretty distant part of the town near her old place of assignation where she had engaged herself before she was well apprized of the revolution that had happened in the mind and morals of her late confidante
chapter x
a chapter which though short may draw tears from some eyes
mr jones was just dressed to wait on lady bellaston when mrs miller rapped at his door and being admitted very earnestly desired his company belowstairs to drink tea in the parlour
upon his entrance into the room she presently introduced a person to him saying this sir is my cousin who hath been so greatly beholden to your goodness for which he begs to return you his sincerest thanks  the man had scarce entered upon that speech which mrs miller had so kindly prefaced when both jones and he looking stedfastly at each other showed at once the utmost tokens of surprize
the voice of the latter began instantly to faulter and instead of finishing his speech he sunk down into a chair crying it is so i am convinced it is so  bless me
what's the meaning of this cries mrs miller you are not ill i hope cousin
some water a dram this instant  be not frighted madam cries jones i have almost as much need of a dram as your cousin
we are equally surprized at this unexpected meeting
your cousin is an acquaintance of mine mrs miller  an acquaintance cries the manoh heaven  ay an acquaintance repeated jones and an honoured acquaintance too
when i do not love and honour the man who dares venture everything to preserve his wife and children from instant destruction may i have a friend capable of disowning me in adversity  oh you are an excellent young man cries mrs milleryes indeed poor creature
he hath ventured everythingif he had not had one of the best of constitutions it must have killed him  cousin cries the man who had now pretty well recovered himself this is the angel from heaven whom i meant
this is he to whom before i saw you i owed the preservation of my peggy
he it was to whose generosity every comfort every support which i have procured for her was owing
he is indeed the worthiest bravest noblest of all human beings
o cousin i have obligations to this gentleman of such a nature  mention nothing of obligations cries jones eagerly not a word i insist upon it not a word meaning i suppose that he would not have him betray the affair of the robbery to any person
if by the trifle you have received from me i have preserved a whole family sure pleasure was never bought so cheap  oh sir cries the man i wish you could this instant see my house
if any person had ever a right to the pleasure you mention i am convinced it is yourself
my cousin tells me she acquainted you with the distress in which she found us
that sir is all greatly removed and chiefly by your goodnessmy children have now a bed to lie onand they havethey haveeternal blessings reward you for itthey have bread to eat
my little boy is recovered my wife is out of danger and i am happy
all all owing to you sir and to my cousin here one of the best of women
indeed sir i must see you at my houseindeed my wife must see you and thank youmy children too must express their gratitudeindeed sir they are not without a sense of their obligation but what is my feeling when i reflect to whom i owe that they are now capable of expressing their gratitudeoh sir the little hearts which you have warmed had now been cold as ice without your assistance  here jones attempted to prevent the poor man from proceeding but indeed the overflowing of his own heart would of itself have stopped his words
and now mrs miller likewise began to pour forth thanksgivings as well in her own name as in that of her cousin and concluded with saying she doubted not but such goodness would meet a glorious reward  jones answered he had been sufficiently rewarded already
your cousin's account madam said he hath given me a sensation more pleasing than i have ever known
he must be a wretch who is unmoved at hearing such a story how transporting then must be the thought of having happily acted a part in this scene
if there are men who cannot feel the delight of giving happiness to others i sincerely pity them as they are incapable of tasting what is in my opinion a greater honour a higher interest and a sweeter pleasure than the ambitious the avaricious or the voluptuous man can ever obtain  the hour of appointment being now come jones was forced to take a hasty leave but not before he had heartily shaken his friend by the hand and desired to see him again as soon as possible promising that he would himself take the first opportunity of visiting him at his own house
he then stept into his chair and proceeded to lady bellaston's greatly exulting in the happiness which he had procured to this poor family nor could he forbear reflecting without horror on the dreadful consequences which must have attended them had he listened rather to the voice of strict justice than to that of mercy when he was attacked on the high road
mrs miller sung forth the praises of jones during the whole evening in which mr anderson while he stayed so passionately accompanied her that he was often on the very point of mentioning the circumstance of the robbery
however he luckily recollected himself and avoided an indiscretion which would have been so much the greater as he knew mrs miller to be extremely strict and nice in her principles
he was likewise well apprized of the loquacity of this lady and yet such was his gratitude that it had almost got the better both of discretion and shame and made him publish that which would have defamed his own character rather than omit any circumstances which might do the fullest honour to his benefactor
chapter xi
in which the reader will be surprized
mr jones was rather earlier than the time appointed and earlier than the lady whose arrival was hindered not only by the distance of the place where she dined but by some other cross accidents very vexatious to one in her situation of mind
he was accordingly shown into the drawingroom where he had not been many minutes before the door opened and in cameno other than sophia herself who had left the play before the end of the first act for this as we have already said being a new play at which two large parties met the one to damn and the other to applaud a violent uproar and an engagement between the two parties had so terrified our heroine that she was glad to put herself under the protection of a young gentleman who safely conveyed her to her chair
as lady bellaston had acquainted her that she should not be at home till late sophia expecting to find no one in the room came hastily in and went directly to a glass which almost fronted her without once looking towards the upper end of the room where the statue of jones now stood motionlessin this glass it was after contemplating her own lovely face that she first discovered the said statue when instantly turning about she perceived the reality of the vision upon which she gave a violent scream and scarce preserved herself from fainting till jones was able to move to her and support her in his arms
to paint the looks or thoughts of either of these lovers is beyond my power
as their sensations from their mutual silence may be judged to have been too big for their own utterance it cannot be supposed that i should be able to express them and the misfortune is that few of my readers have been enough in love to feel by their own hearts what past at this time in theirs
after a short pause jones with faultering accents saidi see madam you are surprizedsurprized answered she oh heavens
indeed i am surprized
i almost doubt whether you are the person you seemindeed cries he my sophia pardon me madam for this once calling you so i am that very wretched jones whom fortune after so many disappointments hath at last kindly conducted to you
oh
my sophia did you know the thousand torments i have suffered in this long fruitless pursuitpursuit of whom said sophia a little recollecting herself and assuming a reserved aircan you be so cruel to ask that question cries jones need i say of you of me answered sophia hath mr jones then any such important business with meto some madam cries jones this might seem an important business giving her the pocketbook
i hope madam you will find it of the same value as when it was lost sophia took the pocketbook and was going to speak when he interrupted her thuslet us not i beseech you lose one of these precious moments which fortune hath so kindly sent us
o my sophia
i have business of a much superior kind
thus on my knees let me ask your pardonmy pardon cries she sure sir after what is past you cannot expect after what i have heardi scarce know what i say answered jones
by heavens
i scarce wish you should pardon me
o my sophia
henceforth never cast away a thought on such a wretch as i am
if any remembrance of me should ever intrude to give a moment's uneasiness to that tender bosom think of my unworthiness and let the remembrance of what passed at upton blot me for ever from your mind  sophia stood trembling all this while
her face was whiter than snow and her heart was throbbing through her stays
but at the mention of upton a blush arose in her cheeks and her eyes which before she had scarce lifted up were turned upon jones with a glance of disdain
he understood this silent reproach and replied to it thus o my sophia
my only love
you cannot hate or despise me more for what happened there than i do myself but yet do me the justice to think that my heart was never unfaithful to you
that had no share in the folly i was guilty of it was even then unalterably yours
though i despaired of possessing you nay almost of ever seeing you more i doated still on your charming idea and could seriously love no other woman
but if my heart had not been engaged she into whose company i accidently fell at that cursed place was not an object of serious love
believe me my angel i never have seen her from that day to this and never intend or desire to see her again sophia in her heart was very glad to hear this but forcing into her face an air of more coldness than she had yet assumed why said she mr jones do you take the trouble to make a defence where you are not accused
if i thought it worth while to accuse you i have a charge of unpardonable nature indeedwhat is it for heaven's sake answered jones trembling and pale expecting to hear of his amour with lady bellaston
oh  said she how is it possible
can everything noble and everything base be lodged together in the same bosom lady bellaston and the ignominious circumstance of having been kept rose again in his mind and stopt his mouth from any reply
could i have expected proceeded sophia such treatment from you
nay from any gentleman from any man of honour
to have my name traduced in public in inns among the meanest vulgar
to have any little favours that my unguarded heart may have too lightly betrayed me to grant boasted of there
nay even to hear that you had been forced to fly from my love  nothing could equal jones's surprize at these words of sophia but yet not being guilty he was much less embarrassed how to defend himself than if she had touched that tender string at which his conscience had been alarmed
by some examination he presently found that her supposing him guilty of so shocking an outrage against his love and her reputation was entirely owing to partridge's talk at the inns before landlords and servants for sophia confessed to him it was from them that she received her intelligence
he had no very great difficulty to make her believe that he was entirely innocent of an offence so foreign to his character but she had a great deal to hinder him from going instantly home and putting partridge to death which he more than once swore he would do
this point being cleared up they soon found themselves so well pleased with each other that jones quite forgot he had begun the conversation with conjuring her to give up all thoughts of him and she was in a temper to have given ear to a petition of a very different nature for before they were aware they had both gone so far that he let fall some words that sounded like a proposal of marriage
to which she replied that did not her duty to her father forbid her to follow her own inclinations ruin with him would be more welcome to her than the most affluent fortune with another man at the mention of the word ruin he started let drop her hand which he had held for some time and striking his breast with his own cried out oh sophia
can i then ruin thee
no by heavens no
i never will act so base a part
dearest sophia whatever it costs me i will renounce you i will give you up i will tear all such hopes from my heart as are inconsistent with your real good
my love i will ever retain but it shall be in silence it shall be at a distance from you it shall be in some foreign land from whence no voice no sigh of my despair shall ever reach and disturb your ears
and when i am deadhe would have gone on but was stopt by a flood of tears which sophia let fall in his bosom upon which she leaned without being able to speak one word
he kissed them off which for some moments she allowed him to do without any resistance but then recollecting herself gently withdrew out of his arms and to turn the discourse from a subject too tender and which she found she could not support bethought herself to ask him a question she never had time to put to him before how he came into that room he began to stammer and would in all probability have raised her suspicions by the answer he was going to give when at once the door opened and in came lady bellaston
having advanced a few steps and seeing jones and sophia together she suddenly stopt when after a pause of a few moments recollecting herself with admirable presence of mind she saidthough with sufficient indications of surprize both in voice and countenancei thought miss western you had been at the play  though sophia had no opportunity of learning of jones by what means he had discovered her yet as she had not the least suspicion of the real truth or that jones and lady bellaston were acquainted so she was very little confounded and the less as the lady had in all their conversations on the subject entirely taken her side against her father
with very little hesitation therefore she went through the whole story of what had happened at the playhouse and the cause of her hasty return
the length of this narrative gave lady bellaston an opportunity of rallying her spirits and of considering in what manner to act
and as the behaviour of sophia gave her hopes that jones had not betrayed her she put on an air of good humour and said i should not have broke in so abruptly upon you miss western if i had known you had company  lady bellaston fixed her eyes on sophia whilst she spoke these words
to which that poor young lady having her face overspread with blushes and confusion answered in a stammering voice i am sure madam i shall always think the honour of your ladyship's company i hope at least cries lady bellaston i interrupt no businessno madam answered sophia our business was at an end
your ladyship may be pleased to remember i have often mentioned the loss of my pocketbook which this gentleman having very luckily found was so kind to return it to me with the bill in it  jones ever since the arrival of lady bellaston had been ready to sink with fear
he sat kicking his heels playing with his fingers and looking more like a fool if it be possible than a young booby squire when he is first introduced into a polite assembly
he began however now to recover himself and taking a hint from the behaviour of lady bellaston who he saw did not intend to claim any acquaintance with him he resolved as entirely to affect the stranger on his part
he said ever since he had the pocketbook in his possession he had used great diligence in enquiring out the lady whose name was writ in it but never till that day could be so fortunate to discover her  sophia had indeed mentioned the loss of her pocketbook to lady bellaston but as jones for some reason or other had never once hinted to her that it was in his possession she believed not one syllable of what sophia now said and wonderfully admired the extreme quickness of the young lady in inventing such an excuse
the reason of sophia's leaving the playhouse met with no better credit and though she could not account for the meeting between these two lovers she was firmly persuaded it was not accidental
with an affected smile therefore she said indeed miss western you have had very good luck in recovering your money
not only as it fell into the hands of a gentleman of honour but as he happened to discover to whom it belonged
i think you would not consent to have it advertisedit was great good fortune sir that you found out to whom the note belonged  oh madam cries jones it was enclosed in a pocketbook in which the young lady's name was written  that was very fortunate indeed cries the ladyand it was no less so that you heard miss western was at my house for she is very little known  jones had at length perfectly recovered his spirits and as he conceived he had now an opportunity of satisfying sophia as to the question she had asked him just before lady bellaston came in he proceeded thus why madam answered he it was by the luckiest chance imaginable i made this discovery
i was mentioning what i had found and the name of the owner the other night to a lady at the masquerade who told me she believed she knew where i might see miss western and if i would come to her house the next morning she would inform me i went according to her appointment but she was not at home nor could i ever meet with her till this morning when she directed me to your ladyship's house
i came accordingly and did myself the honour to ask for your ladyship and upon my saying that i had very particular business a servant showed me into this room where i had not been long before the young lady returned from the play  upon his mentioning the masquerade he looked very slily at lady bellaston without any fear of being remarked by sophia for she was visibly too much confounded to make any observations
this hint a little alarmed the lady and she was silent when jones who saw the agitation of sophia's mind resolved to take the only method of relieving her which was by retiring but before he did this he said i believe madam it is customary to give some reward on these occasionsi must insist on a very high one for my honestyit is madam no less than the honour of being permitted to pay another visit here  sir replied the lady i make no doubt that you are a gentleman and my doors are never shut to people of fashion  jones then after proper ceremonials departed highly to his own satisfaction and no less to that of sophia who was terribly alarmed lest lady bellaston should discover what she knew already but too well
upon the stairs jones met his old acquaintance mrs honour who notwithstanding all she had said against him was now so well bred to behave with great civility
this meeting proved indeed a lucky circumstance as he communicated to her the house where he lodged with which sophia was unacquainted
chapter xii
in which the thirteenth book is concluded
the elegant lord shaftesbury somewhere objects to telling too much truth by which it may be fairly inferred that in some cases to lie is not only excusable but commendable
and surely there are no persons who may so properly challenge a right to this commendable deviation from truth as young women in the affair of love for which they may plead precept education and above all the sanction nay i may say the necessity of custom by which they are restrained not from submitting to the honest impulses of nature for that would be a foolish prohibition but from owning them
we are not therefore ashamed to say that our heroine now pursued the dictates of the abovementioned right honourable philosopher
as she was perfectly satisfied then that lady bellaston was ignorant of the person of jones so she determined to keep her in that ignorance though at the expense of a little fibbing
jones had not been long gone before lady bellaston cryed upon my word a good pretty young fellow i wonder who he is for i don't remember ever to have seen his face before  nor i neither madam cries sophia
i must say he behaved very handsomely in relation to my note  yes and he is a very handsome fellow said the lady don't you think so  i did not take much notice of him answered sophia but i thought he seemed rather awkward and ungenteel than otherwise  you are extremely right cries lady bellaston you may see by his manner that he hath not kept good company
nay notwithstanding his returning your note and refusing the reward i almost question whether he is a gentlemani have always observed there is a something in persons well born which others can never acquirei think i will give orders not to be at home to him  nay sure madam answered sophia one can't suspect after what he hath donebesides if your ladyship observed him there was an elegance in his discourse a delicacy a prettiness of expression that that  i confess said lady bellaston the fellow hath wordsand indeed sophia you must forgive me indeed you must  i forgive your ladyship said sophia
yes indeed you must answered she laughing for i had a horrible suspicion when i first came into the roomi vow you must forgive it but i suspected it was mr jones himself  did your ladyship indeed cries sophia blushing and affecting a laugh
yes i vow i did answered she
i can't imagine what put it into my head for give the fellow his due he was genteely drest which i think dear sophy is not commonly the case with your friend  this raillery cries sophia is a little cruel lady bellaston after my promise to your ladyship  not at all child said the ladyit would have been cruel before but after you have promised me never to marry without your father's consent in which you know is implied your giving up jones sure you can bear a little raillery on a passion which was pardonable enough in a young girl in the country and of which you tell me you have so entirely got the better
what must i think my dear sophy if you cannot bear a little ridicule even on his dress
i shall begin to fear you are very far gone indeed and almost question whether you have dealt ingenuously with me  indeed madam cries sophia your ladyship mistakes me if you imagine i had any concern on his account  on his account answered the lady you must have mistaken me i went no farther than his dressfor i would not injure your taste by any other comparisoni don't imagine my dear sophy if your mr jones had been such a fellow as this  i thought says sophia your ladyship had allowed him to be handsome  whom pray cried the lady hastily
mr jones answered sophiaand immediately recollecting herself mr jonesno no i ask your pardoni mean the gentleman who was just now here  o sophy
sophy cries the lady this mr jones i am afraid still runs in your head  then upon my honour madam said sophia mr jones is as entirely indifferent to me as the gentleman who just now left us  upon my honour said lady bellaston i believe it
forgive me therefore a little innocent raillery but i promise you i will never mention his name any more  and now the two ladies separated infinitely more to the delight of sophia than of lady bellaston who would willingly have tormented her rival a little longer had not business of more importance called her away
as for sophia her mind was not perfectly easy under this first practice of deceit upon which when she retired to her chamber she reflected with the highest uneasiness and conscious shame
nor could the peculiar hardship of her situation and the necessity of the case at all reconcile her mind to her conduct for the frame of her mind was too delicate to bear the thought of having been guilty of a falsehood however qualified by circumstances
nor did this thought once suffer her to close her eyes during the whole succeeding night
book xiv
containing two days
chapter i
an essay to prove that an author will write the better for having some knowledge of the subject on which he writes
as several gentlemen in these times by the wonderful force of genius only without the least assistance of learning perhaps without being well able to read have made a considerable figure in the republic of letters the modern critics i am told have lately begun to assert that all kind of learning is entirely useless to a writer and indeed no other than a kind of fetters on the natural sprightliness and activity of the imagination which is thus weighed down and prevented from soaring to those high flights which otherwise it would be able to reach
this doctrine i am afraid is at present carried much too far for why should writing differ so much from all other arts
the nimbleness of a dancingmaster is not at all prejudiced by being taught to move nor doth any mechanic i believe exercise his tools the worse by having learnt to use them
for my own part i cannot conceive that homer or virgil would have writ with more fire if instead of being masters of all the learning of their times they had been as ignorant as most of the authors of the present age
nor do i believe that all the imagination fire and judgment of pitt could have produced those orations that have made the senate of england in these our times a rival in eloquence to greece and rome if he had not been so well read in the writings of demosthenes and cicero as to have transferred their whole spirit into his speeches and with their spirit their knowledge too
i would not here be understood to insist on the same fund of learning in any of my brethren as cicero persuades us is necessary to the composition of an orator
on the contrary very little reading is i conceive necessary to the poet less to the critic and the least of all to the politician
for the first perhaps byshe's art of poetry and a few of our modern poets may suffice for the second a moderate heap of plays and for the last an indifferent collection of political journals
to say the truth i require no more than that a man should have some little knowledge of the subject on which he treats according to the old maxim of law quam quisque nrit artem in e se exerceat
with this alone a writer may sometimes do tolerably well and indeed without this all the other learning in the world will stand him in little stead
for instance let us suppose that homer and virgil aristotle and cicero thucydides and livy could have met all together and have clubbed their several talents to have composed a treatise on the art of dancing i believe it will be readily agreed they could not have equalled the excellent treatise which mr essex hath given us on that subject entitled the rudiments of genteel education
and indeed should the excellent mr broughton be prevailed on to set fist to paper and to complete the abovesaid rudiments by delivering down the true principles of athletics i question whether the world will have any cause to lament that none of the great writers either antient or modern have ever treated about that noble and useful art
to avoid a multiplicity of examples in so plain a case and to come at once to my point i am apt to conceive that one reason why many english writers have totally failed in describing the manners of upper life may possibly be that in reality they know nothing of it
this is a knowledge unhappily not in the power of many authors to arrive at
books will give us a very imperfect idea of it nor will the stage a much better the fine gentleman formed upon reading the former will almost always turn out a pedant and he who forms himself upon the latter a coxcomb
nor are the characters drawn from these models better supported
vanbrugh and congreve copied nature but they who copy them draw as unlike the present age as hogarth would do if he was to paint a rout or a drum in the dresses of titian and of vandyke
in short imitation here will not do the business
the picture must be after nature herself
a true knowledge of the world is gained only by conversation and the manners of every rank must be seen in order to be known
now it happens that this higher order of mortals is not to be seen like all the rest of the human species for nothing in the streets shops and coffeehouses nor are they shown like the upper rank of animals for so much apiece
in short this is a sight to which no persons are admitted without one or other of these qualifications viz either birth or fortune or what is equivalent to both the honourable profession of a gamester
and very unluckily for the world persons so qualified very seldom care to take upon themselves the bad trade of writing which is generally entered upon by the lower and poorer sort as it is a trade which many think requires no kind of stock to set up with
hence those strange monsters in lace and embroidery in silks and brocades with vast wigs and hoops which under the name of lords and ladies strut the stage to the great delight of attorneys and their clerks in the pit and of the citizens and their apprentices in the galleries and which are no more to be found in real life than the centaur the chimera or any other creature of mere fiction
but to let my reader into a secret this knowledge of upper life though very necessary for preventing mistakes is no very great resource to a writer whose province is comedy or that kind of novels which like this i am writing is of the comic class
what mr pope says of women is very applicable to most in this station who are indeed so entirely made up of form and affectation that they have no character at all at least none which appears
i will venture to say the highest life is much the dullest and affords very little humour or entertainment
the various callings in lower spheres produce the great variety of humorous characters whereas here except among the few who are engaged in the pursuit of ambition and the fewer still who have a relish for pleasure all is vanity and servile imitation
dressing and cards eating and drinking bowing and courtesying make up the business of their lives
some there are however of this rank upon whom passion exercises its tyranny and hurries them far beyond the bounds which decorum prescribes of these the ladies are as much distinguished by their noble intrepidity and a certain superior contempt of reputation from the frail ones of meaner degree as a virtuous woman of quality is by the elegance and delicacy of her sentiments from the honest wife of a yeoman and shopkeeper
lady bellaston was of this intrepid character but let not my country readers conclude from her that this is the general conduct of women of fashion or that we mean to represent them as such
they might as well suppose that every clergyman was represented by thwackum or every soldier by ensign northerton
there is not indeed a greater error than that which universally prevails among the vulgar who borrowing their opinion from some ignorant satirists have affixed the character of lewdness to these times
on the contrary i am convinced there never was less of love intrigue carried on among persons of condition than now
our present women have been taught by their mothers to fix their thoughts only on ambition and vanity and to despise the pleasures of love as unworthy their regard and being afterwards by the care of such mothers married without having husbands they seem pretty well confirmed in the justness of those sentiments whence they content themselves for the dull remainder of life with the pursuit of more innocent but i am afraid more childish amusements the bare mention of which would ill suit with the dignity of this history
in my humble opinion the true characteristic of the present beau monde is rather folly than vice and the only epithet which it deserves is that of frivolous
chapter ii
containing letters and other matters which attend amours
jones had not been long at home before he received the following letter    i was never more surprized than when i found you was gone
when you   left the room i little imagined you intended to have left the house   without seeing me again
your behaviour is all of a piece and   convinces me how much i ought to despise a heart which can doat upon   an idiot though i know not whether i should not admire her cunning   more than her simplicity wonderful both
for though she understood   not a word of what passed between us yet she had the skill the   assurance thewhat shall i call it
to deny to my face that she   knows you or ever saw you beforewas this a scheme laid between   you and have you been base enough to betray meo how i despise   her you and all the world but chiefly myself
fori dare not   write what i should afterwards run mad to read but remember i can   detest as violently as i have loved  jones had but little time given him to reflect on this letter before a second was brought him from the same hand and this likewise we shall set down in the precise words
when you consider the hurry of spirits in which i must have writ   you cannot be surprized at any expressions in my former noteyet   perhaps on reflection they were rather too warm
at least i would   if possible think all owing to the odious playhouse and to the   impertinence of a fool which detained me beyond my   appointmenthow easy is it to think well of those we   loveperhaps you desire i should think so
i have resolved to   see you tonight so come to me immediately
psi have ordered to be at home to none but yourself
psmr jones will imagine i shall assist him in his defence   for i believe he cannot desire to impose on me more than i desire to   impose on myself
pscome immediately  to the men of intrigue i refer the determination whether the angry or the tender letter gave the greatest uneasiness to jones
certain it is he had no violent inclination to pay any more visits that evening unless to one single person
however he thought his honour engaged and had not this been motive sufficient he would not have ventured to blow the temper of lady bellaston into that flame of which he had reason to think it susceptible and of which he feared the consequence might be a discovery to sophia which he dreaded
after some discontented walks therefore about the room he was preparing to depart when the lady kindly prevented him not by another letter but by her own presence
she entered the room very disordered in her dress and very discomposed in her looks and threw herself into a chair where having recovered her breath she saidyou see sir when women have gone one length too far they will stop at none
if any person would have sworn this to me a week ago i would not have believed it of myself i hope madam said jones my charming lady bellaston will be as difficult to believe anything against one who is so sensible of the many obligations she hath conferred upon him  indeed says she sensible of obligations
did i expect to hear such cold language from mr jones pardon me my dear angel said he if after the letters i have received the terrors of your anger though i know not how i have deserved itand have i then says she with a smile so angry a countenancehave i really brought a chiding face with meif there be honour in man said he i have done nothing to merit your angeryou remember the appointment you sent me i went in pursuancei beseech you cried she do not run through the odious recitalanswer me but one question and i shall be easy
have you not betrayed my honour to herjones fell upon his knees and began to utter the most violent protestations when partridge came dancing and capering into the room like one drunk with joy crying out she's found
she's foundhere sir here she's heremrs honour is upon the stairs stop her a moment cries joneshere madam step behind the bed i have no other room nor closet nor place on earth to hide you in sure never was so damned an accidentdn'd indeed said the lady as she went to her place of concealment and presently afterwards in came mrs honour
heyday says she mr jones what's the matterthat impudent rascal your servant would scarce let me come upstairs
i hope he hath not the same reason to keep me from you as he had at uptoni suppose you hardly expected to see me but you have certainly bewitched my lady
poor dear young lady
to be sure i loves her as tenderly as if she was my own sister
lord have mercy upon you if you don't make her a good husband
and to be sure if you do not nothing can be bad enough for you jones begged her only to whisper for that there was a lady dying in the next room
a lady cries she ay i suppose one of your ladieso mr jones there are too many of them in the world i believe we are got into the house of one for my lady bellaston i darst to say is no better than she should behush
hush cries jones every word is overheard in the next room i don't care a farthing cries honour i speaks no scandal of any one but to be sure the servants make no scruple of saying as how her ladyship meets men at another placewhere the house goes under the name of a poor gentlewoman but her ladyship pays the rent and many's the good thing besides they say she hath of herhere jones after expressing the utmost uneasiness offered to stop her mouthheyday
why sure mr jones you will let me speak i speaks no scandal for i only says what i heard from othersand thinks i to myself much good may it do the gentlewoman with her riches if she comes by it in such a wicked manner
to be sure it is better to be poor and honest the servants are villains cries jones and abuse their lady unjustlyay to be sure servants are always villains and so my lady says and won't hear a word of itno i am convinced says jones my sophia is above listening to such base scandal nay i believe it is no scandal neither cries honour for why should she meet men at another houseit can never be for any good for if she had a lawful design of being courted as to be sure any lady may lawfully give her company to men upon that account why where can be the sensei protest cries jones i can't hear all this of a lady of such honour and a relation of sophia besides you will distract the poor lady in the next roomlet me entreat you to walk with me down stairsnay sir if you won't let me speak i have donehere sir is a letter from my young ladywhat would some men give to have this
but mr jones i think you are not over and above generous and yet i have heard some servants saybut i am sure you will do me the justice to own i never saw the colour of your money here jones hastily took the letter and presently after slipped five pieces into her hand
he then returned a thousand thanks to his dear sophia in a whisper and begged her to leave him to read her letter she presently departed not without expressing much grateful sense of his generosity
lady bellaston now came from behind the curtain
how shall i describe her rage
her tongue was at first incapable of utterance but streams of fire darted from her eyes and well indeed they might for her heart was all in a flame
and now as soon as her voice found way instead of expressing any indignation against honour or her own servants she began to attack poor jones
you see said she what i have sacrificed to you my reputation my honourgone for ever
and what return have i found
neglected slighted for a country girl for an idiotwhat neglect madam or what slight cries jones have i been guilty ofmr jones said she it is in vain to dissemble if you will make me easy you must entirely give her up and as a proof of your intention show me the letterwhat letter madam  said jones
nay surely said she you cannot have the confidence to deny your having received a letter by the hands of that trollopand can your ladyship cries he ask of me what i must part with my honour before i grant
have i acted in such a manner by your ladyship
could i be guilty of betraying this poor innocent girl to you what security could you have that i should not act the same part by yourself
a moment's reflection will i am sure convince you that a man with whom the secrets of a lady are not safe must be the most contemptible of wretchesvery well said shei need not insist on your becoming this contemptible wretch in your own opinion for the inside of the letter could inform me of nothing more than i know already
i see the footing you are uponhere ensued a long conversation which the reader who is not too curious will thank me for not inserting at length
it shall suffice therefore to inform him that lady bellaston grew more and more pacified and at length believed or affected to believe his protestations that his meeting with sophia that evening was merely accidental and every other matter which the reader already knows and which as jones set before her in the strongest light it is plain that she had in reality no reason to be angry with him
she was not however in her heart perfectly satisfied with his refusal to show her the letter so deaf are we to the clearest reason when it argues against our prevailing passions
she was indeed well convinced that sophia possessed the first place in jones's affections and yet haughty and amorous as this lady was she submitted at last to bear the second place or to express it more properly in a legal phrase was contented with the possession of that of which another woman had the reversion
it was at length agreed that jones should for the future visit at the house for that sophia her maid and all the servants would place these visits to the account of sophia and that she herself would be considered as the person imposed upon
this scheme was contrived by the lady and highly relished by jones who was indeed glad to have a prospect of seeing his sophia at any rate and the lady herself was not a little pleased with the imposition on sophia which jones she thought could not possibly discover to her for his own sake
the next day was appointed for the first visit and then after proper ceremonials the lady bellaston returned home
chapter iii
containing various matters
jones was no sooner alone than he eagerly broke open his letter and read as follows    sir it is impossible to express what i have suffered since you   left this house and as i have reason to think you intend coming   here again i have sent honour though so late at night as she   tells me she knows your lodgings to prevent you
i charge you by   all the regard you have for me not to think of visiting here for   it will certainly be discovered nay i almost doubt from some   things which have dropt from her ladyship that she is not already   without some suspicion
something favourable perhaps may happen we   must wait with patience but i once more entreat you if you have   any concern for my ease do not think of returning hither  this letter administered the same kind of consolation to poor jones which job formerly received from his friends
besides disappointing all the hopes which he promised to himself from seeing sophia he was reduced to an unhappy dilemma with regard to lady bellaston for there are some certain engagements which as he well knew do very difficultly admit of any excuse for the failure and to go after the strict prohibition from sophia he was not to be forced by any human power
at length after much deliberation which during that night supplied the place of sleep he determined to feign himself sick for this suggested itself as the only means of failing the appointed visit without incensing lady bellaston which he had more than one reason of desiring to avoid
the first thing however which he did in the morning was to write an answer to sophia which he inclosed in one to honour
he then despatched another to lady bellaston containing the abovementioned excuse and to this he soon received the following answer    i am vexed that i cannot see you here this afternoon but more   concerned for the occasion take great care of yourself and have   the best advice and i hope there will be no dangeri am so   tormented all this morning with fools that i have scarce a moment's   time to write to you
adieu
psi will endeavour to call on you this evening at ninebe   sure to be alone  mr jones now received a visit from mrs miller who after some formal introduction began the following speechi am very sorry sir to wait upon you on such an occasion but i hope you will consider the ill consequence which it must be to the reputation of my poor girls if my house should once be talked of as a house of illfame
i hope you won't think me therefore guilty of impertinence if i beg you not to bring any more ladies in at that time of night
the clock had struck two before one of them went awayi do assure you madam  said jones the lady who was here last night and who staid the latest for the other only brought me a letter is a woman of very great fashion and my near relationi don't know what fashion she is of answered mrs miller but i am sure no woman of virtue unless a very near relation indeed would visit a young gentleman at ten at night and stay four hours in his room with him alone besides sir the behaviour of her chairmen shows what she was for they did nothing but make jests all the evening in the entry and asked mr partridge in the hearing of my own maid if madam intended to stay with his master all night with a great deal of stuff not proper to be repeated
i have really a great respect for you mr jones upon your own account nay i have a very high obligation to you for your generosity to my cousin
indeed i did not know how very good you had been till lately
little did i imagine to what dreadful courses the poor man's distress had driven him
little did i think when you gave me the ten guineas that you had given them to a highwayman
o heavens
what goodness have you shown
how have you preserved this familythe character which mr allworthy hath formerly given me of you was i find strictly trueand indeed if i had no obligation to you my obligations to him are such that on his account i should shew you the utmost respect in my powernay believe me dear mr jones if my daughters' and my own reputation were out of the case i should for your own sake be sorry that so pretty a young gentleman should converse with these women but if you are resolved to do it i must beg you to take another lodging for i do not myself like to have such things carried on under my roof but more especially upon the account of my girls who have little heaven knows besides their characters to recommend them jones started and changed colour at the name of allworthy
indeed mrs miller answered he a little warmly i do not take this at all kind
i will never bring any slander on your house but i must insist on seeing what company i please in my own room and if that gives you any offence i shall as soon as i am able look for another lodgingi am sorry we must part then sir said she but i am convinced mr allworthy himself would never come within my doors if he had the least suspicion of my keeping an ill housevery well madam said jonesi hope sir said she you are not angry for i would not for the world offend any of mr allworthy's family
i have not slept a wink all night about this matteri am sorry i have disturbed your rest madam  said jones but i beg you will send partridge up to me immediately  which she promised to do and then with a very low courtesy retired
as soon as partridge arrived jones fell upon him in the most outrageous manner
how often said he am i to suffer for your folly or rather for my own in keeping you
is that tongue of yours resolved upon my destruction what have i done sir answered affrighted partridge
who was it gave you authority to mention the story of the robbery or that the man you saw here was the person  i sir cries partridge
now don't be guilty of a falsehood in denying it said jones
if i did mention such a matter answers partridge i am sure i thought no harm for i should not have opened my lips if it had not been to his own friends and relations who i imagined would have let it go no farther but i have a much heavier charge against you cries jones than this
how durst you after all the precautions i gave you mention the name of mr allworthy in this house partridge denied that he ever had with many oaths
how else said jones should mrs miller be acquainted that there was any connexion between him and me
and it is but this moment she told me she respected me on his account o lord sir said partridge i desire only to be heard out and to be sure never was anything so unfortunate hear me but out and you will own how wrongfully you have accused me
when mrs honour came downstairs last night she met me in the entry and asked me when my master had heard from mr allworthy and to be sure mrs miller heard the very words and the moment madam honour was gone she called me into the parlour to her
mr partridge' says she what mr allworthy is it that the gentlewoman mentioned
is it the great mr allworthy of somersetshire'
upon my word madam' says i i know nothing of the matter'
sure' says she your master is not the mr jones i have heard mr allworthy talk of'
upon my word madam' says i i know nothing of the matter'
then' says she turning to her daughter nancy says she as sure as tenpence this is the very young gentleman and he agrees exactly with the squire's description'
the lord above knows who it was told her for i am the arrantest villain that ever walked upon two legs if ever it came out of my mouth
i promise you sir i can keep a secret when i am desired
nay sir so far was i from telling her anything about mr allworthy that i told her the very direct contrary for though i did not contradict it at that moment yet as second thoughts they say are best so when i came to consider that somebody must have informed her thinks i to myself i will put an end to the story and so i went back again into the parlour some time afterwards and says i upon my word says i whoever says i told you that this gentleman was mr jones that is says i that this mr jones was that mr jones told you a confounded lie and i beg says i you will never mention any such matter says i for my master says i will think i must have told you so and i defy anybody in the house ever to say i mentioned any such word
to be certain sir it is a wonderful thing and i have been thinking with myself ever since how it was she came to know it not but i saw an old woman here t'other day a begging at the door who looked as like her we saw in warwickshire that caused all that mischief to us
to be sure it is never good to pass by an old woman without giving her something especially if she looks at you for all the world shall never persuade me but that they have a great power to do mischief and to be sure i shall never see an old woman again but i shall think to myself infandum regina jubes renovare dolorem  the simplicity of partridge set jones a laughing and put a final end to his anger which had indeed seldom any long duration in his mind and instead of commenting on his defence he told him he intended presently to leave those lodgings and ordered him to go and endeavour to get him others
chapter iv
which we hope will be very attentively perused by young people of both sexes
partridge had no sooner left mr jones than mr nightingale with whom he had now contracted a great intimacy came to him and after a short salutation said so tom i hear you had company very late last night
upon my soul you are a happy fellow who have not been in town above a fortnight and can keep chairs waiting at your door till two in the morning he then ran on with much commonplace raillery of the same kind till jones at last interrupted him saying i suppose you have received all this information from mrs miller who hath been up here a little while ago to give me warning
the good woman is afraid it seems of the reputation of her daughters oh
she is wonderfully nice says nightingale upon that account if you remember she would not let nancy go with us to the masquerade nay upon my honour i think she's in the right of it says jones however i have taken her at her word and have sent partridge to look for another lodging if you will says nightingale we may i believe be again together for to tell you a secret which i desire you won't mention in the family i intend to quit the house today  what hath mrs miller given you warning too my friend cries jones
no answered the other but the rooms are not convenient enough
besides i am grown weary of this part of the town
i want to be nearer the places of diversion so i am going to pallmall and do you intend to make a secret of your going away said jones
i promise you answered nightingale i don't intend to bilk my lodgings but i have a private reason for not taking a formal leave  not so private answered jones i promise you i have seen it ever since the second day of my coming to the house
here will be some wet eyes on your departure
poor nancy i pity her faith
indeed jack you have played the fool with that girl
you have given her a longing which i am afraid nothing will ever cure her of nightingale answered what the devil would you have me do
would you have me marry her to cure her no answered jones i would not have had you make love to her as you have often done in my presence
i have been astonished at the blindness of her mother in never seeing it  pugh see it cries nightingale
what the devil should she see  why see said jones that you have made her daughter distractedly in love with you
the poor girl cannot conceal it a moment her eyes are never off from you and she always colours every time you come into the room
indeed i pity her heartily for she seems to be one of the bestnatured and honestest of human creatures and so answered nightingale according to your doctrine one must not amuse oneself by any common gallantries with women for fear they should fall in love with us indeed jack said jones you wilfully misunderstand me i do not fancy women are so apt to fall in love but you have gone far beyond common gallantries what do you suppose says nightingale that we have been abed together no upon my honour  answered jones very seriously i do not suppose so ill of you nay i will go farther i do not imagine you have laid a regular premeditated scheme for the destruction of the quiet of a poor little creature or have even foreseen the consequence for i am sure thou art a very goodnatured fellow and such a one can never be guilty of a cruelty of that kind but at the same time you have pleased your own vanity without considering that this poor girl was made a sacrifice to it and while you have had no design but of amusing an idle hour you have actually given her reason to flatter herself that you had the most serious designs in her favour
prithee jack answer me honestly to what have tended all those elegant and luscious descriptions of happiness arising from violent and mutual fondness
all those warm professions of tenderness and generous disinterested love
did you imagine she would not apply them
or speak ingenuously did not you intend she should upon my soul tom cries nightingale i did not think this was in thee
thou wilt make an admirable parson
so i suppose you would not go to bed to nancy now if she would let you  no cries jones may i be dn'd if i would tom tom answered nightingale last night remember last night       when every eye was closed and the pale moon      and silent stars shone conscious of the theft  lookee mr nightingale said jones i am no canting hypocrite nor do i pretend to the gift of chastity more than my neighbours
i have been guilty with women i own it but am not conscious that i have ever injured anynor would i to procure pleasure to myself be knowingly the cause of misery to any human being  well well said nightingale i believe you and i am convinced you acquit me of any such thing  i do from my heart answered jones of having debauched the girl but not from having gained her affections  if i have said nightingale i am sorry for it but time and absence will soon wear off such impressions
it is a receipt i must take myself for to confess the truth to youi never liked any girl half so much in my whole life but i must let you into the whole secret tom
my father hath provided a match for me with a woman i never saw and she is now coming to town in order for me to make my addresses to her  at these words jones burst into a loud fit of laughter when nightingale criednay prithee don't turn me into ridicule
the devil take me if i am not half mad about this matter
my poor nancy
oh
jones jones i wish i had a fortune in my own possession  i heartily wish you had cries jones for if this be the case i sincerely pity you both but surely you don't intend to go away without taking your leave of her  i would not answered nightingale undergo the pain of taking leave for ten thousand pounds besides i am convinced instead of answering any good purpose it would only serve to inflame my poor nancy the more
i beg therefore you would not mention a word of it today and in the evening or tomorrow morning i intend to depart  jones promised he would not and said upon reflection he thought as he had determined and was obliged to leave her he took the most prudent method
he then told nightingale he should be very glad to lodge in the same house with him and it was accordingly agreed between them that nightingale should procure him either the ground floor or the two pair of stairs for the young gentleman himself was to occupy that which was between them
this nightingale of whom we shall be presently obliged to say a little more was in the ordinary transactions of life a man of strict honour and what is more rare among young gentlemen of the town one of strict honesty too yet in affairs of love he was somewhat loose in his morals not that he was even here as void of principle as gentlemen sometimes are and oftener affect to be but it is certain he had been guilty of some indefensible treachery to women and had in a certain mystery called making love practised many deceits which if he had used in trade he would have been counted the greatest villain upon earth
but as the world i know not well for what reason agree to see this treachery in a better light he was so far from being ashamed of his iniquities of this kind that he gloried in them and would often boast of his skill in gaining of women and his triumphs over their hearts for which he had before this time received some rebukes from jones who always exprest great bitterness against any misbehaviour to the fair part of the species who if considered he said as they ought to be in the light of the dearest friends were to be cultivated honoured and caressed with the utmost love and tenderness but if regarded as enemies were a conquest of which a man ought rather to be ashamed than to value himself upon it
chapter v  a short account of the history of mrs miller
jones this day eat a pretty good dinner for a sick man that is to say the larger half of a shoulder of mutton
in the afternoon he received an invitation from mrs miller to drink tea for that good woman having learnt either by means of partridge or by some other means natural or supernatural that he had a connexion with mr allworthy could not endure the thoughts of parting with him in an angry manner
jones accepted the invitation and no sooner was the teakettle removed and the girls sent out of the room than the widow without much preface began as follows well there are very surprizing things happen in this world but certainly it is a wonderful business that i should have a relation of mr allworthy in my house and never know anything of the matter
alas
sir you little imagine what a friend that best of gentlemen hath been to me and mine
yes sir i am not ashamed to own it it is owing to his goodness that i did not long since perish for want and leave my poor little wretches two destitute helpless friendless orphans to the care or rather to the cruelty of the world
you must know sir though i am now reduced to get my living by letting lodgings i was born and bred a gentlewoman
my father was an officer of the army and died in a considerable rank but he lived up to his pay and as that expired with him his family at his death became beggars
we were three sisters
one of us had the good luck to die soon after of the smallpox a lady was so kind as to take the second out of charity as she said to wait upon her
the mother of this lady had been a servant to my grandmother and having inherited a vast fortune from her father which he had got by pawnbroking was married to a gentleman of great estate and fashion
she used my sister so barbarously often upbraiding her with her birth and poverty calling her in derision a gentlewoman that i believe she at length broke the heart of the poor girl
in short she likewise died within a twelvemonth after my father
fortune thought proper to provide better for me and within a month from his decease i was married to a clergyman who had been my lover a long time before and who had been very ill used by my father on that account for though my poor father could not give any of us a shilling yet he bred us up as delicately considered us and would have had us consider ourselves as highly as if we had been the richest heiresses
but my dear husband forgot all this usage and the moment we were become fatherless he immediately renewed his addresses to me so warmly that i who always liked and now more than ever esteemed him soon complied
five years did i live in a state of perfect happiness with that best of men till at lastoh
cruel
cruel fortune that ever separated us that deprived me of the kindest of husbands and my poor girls of the tenderest parento my poor girls
you never knew the blessing which ye losti am ashamed mr jones of this womanish weakness but i shall never mention him without tears i ought rather madam said jones to be ashamed that i do not accompany you well sir continued she i was now left a second time in a much worse condition than before besides the terrible affliction i was to encounter i had now two children to provide for and was if possible more pennyless than ever when that great that good that glorious man mr allworthy who had some little acquaintance with my husband accidentally heard of my distress and immediately writ this letter to me
here sir here it is i put it into my pocket to shew it you
this is the letter sir i must and will read it to you
'madam    'i heartily condole with you on your late grievous loss which your   own good sense and the excellent lessons you must have learnt from   the worthiest of men will better enable you to bear than any advice   which i am capable of giving
nor have i any doubt that you whom i   have heard to be the tenderest of mothers will suffer any   immoderate indulgence of grief to prevent you from discharging your   duty to those poor infants who now alone stand in need of your   tenderness
however as you must be supposed at present to be incapable of   much worldly consideration you will pardon my having ordered a   person to wait on you and to pay you twenty guineas which i beg   you will accept till i have the pleasure of seeing you and believe   me to be madam c'  this letter sir i received within a fortnight after the irreparable loss i have mentioned and within a fortnight afterwards mr allworthythe blessed mr allworthy came to pay me a visit when he placed me in the house where you now see me gave me a large sum of money to furnish it and settled an annuity of  ayear upon me which i have constantly received ever since
judge then mr jones in what regard i must hold a benefactor to whom i owe the preservation of my life and of those dear children for whose sake alone my life is valuable
do not therefore think me impertinent mr jones since i must esteem one for whom i know mr allworthy hath so much value if i beg you not to converse with these wicked women
you are a young gentleman and do not know half their artful wiles
do not be angry with me sir for what i said upon account of my house you must be sensible it would be the ruin of my poor dear girls
besides sir you cannot but be acquainted that mr allworthy himself would never forgive my conniving at such matters and particularly with you  upon my word madam said jones you need make no farther apology nor do i in the least take anything ill you have said but give me leave as no one can have more value than myself for mr allworthy to deliver you from one mistake which perhaps would not be altogether for his honour i do assure you i am no relation of his  alas
sir answered she i know you are not i know very well who you are for mr allworthy hath told me all but i do assure you had you been twenty times his son he could not have expressed more regard for you than he hath often expressed in my presence
you need not be ashamed sir of what you are i promise you no good person will esteem you the less on that account
no mr jones the words dishonourable birth' are nonsense as my dear dear husband used to say unless the word dishonourable' be applied to the parents for the children can derive no real dishonour from an act of which they are intirely innocent  here jones heaved a deep sigh and then said since i perceive madam you really do know me and mr allworthy hath thought proper to mention my name to you and since you have been so explicit with me as to your own affairs i will acquaint you with some more circumstances concerning myself and these mrs miller having expressed great desire and curiosity to hear he began and related to her his whole history without once mentioning the name of sophia
there is a kind of sympathy in honest minds by means of which they give an easy credit to each other
mrs miller believed all which jones told her to be true and exprest much pity and concern for him
she was beginning to comment on the story but jones interrupted her for as the hour of assignation now drew nigh he began to stipulate for a second interview with the lady that evening which he promised should be the last at her house swearing at the same time that she was one of great distinction and that nothing but what was intirely innocent was to pass between them and i do firmly believe he intended to keep his word
mrs miller was at length prevailed on and jones departed to his chamber where he sat alone till twelve o'clock but no lady bellaston appeared
as we have said that this lady had a great affection for jones and as it must have appeared that she really had so the reader may perhaps wonder at the first failure of her appointment as she apprehended him to be confined by sickness a season when friendship seems most to require such visits
this behaviour therefore in the lady may by some be condemned as unnatural but that is not our fault for our business is only to record truth
chapter vi
containing a scene which we doubt not will affect all our readers
mr jones closed not his eyes during all the former part of the night not owing to any uneasiness which he conceived at being disappointed by lady bellaston nor was sophia herself though most of his waking hours were justly to be charged to her account the present cause of dispelling his slumbers
in fact poor jones was one of the bestnatured fellows alive and had all that weakness which is called compassion and which distinguishes this imperfect character from that noble firmness of mind which rolls a man as it were within himself and like a polished bowl enables him to run through the world without being once stopped by the calamities which happen to others
he could not help therefore compassionating the situation of poor nancy whose love for mr nightingale seemed to him so apparent that he was astonished at the blindness of her mother who had more than once the preceding evening remarked to him the great change in the temper of her daughter who from being she said one of the liveliest merriest girls in the world was on a sudden become all gloom and melancholy  sleep however at length got the better of all resistance and now as if he had already been a deity as the antients imagined and an offended one too he seemed to enjoy his dearbought conquestto speak simply and without any metaphor mr jones slept till eleven the next morning and would perhaps have continued in the same quiet situation much longer had not a violent uproar awakened him
partridge was now summoned who being asked what was the matter answered that there was a dreadful hurricane belowstairs that miss nancy was in fits and that the other sister and the mother were both crying and lamenting over her jones expressed much concern at this news which partridge endeavoured to relieve by saying with a smile he fancied the young lady was in no danger of death for that susan which was the name of the maid had given him to understand it was nothing more than a common affair
in short said he miss nancy hath had a mind to be as wise as her mother that's all she was a little hungry it seems and so sat down to dinner before grace was said and so there is a child coming for the foundling hospitalprithee leave thy stupid jesting  cries jones
is the misery of these poor wretches a subject of mirth
go immediately to mrs miller and tell her i beg leavestay you will make some blunder i will go myself for she desired me to breakfast with her he then rose and dressed himself as fast as he could and while he was dressing partridge notwithstanding many severe rebukes could not avoid throwing forth certain pieces of brutality commonly called jests on this occasion
jones was no sooner dressed than he walked downstairs and knocking at the door was presently admitted by the maid into the outward parlour which was as empty of company as it was of any apparatus for eating
mrs miller was in the inner room with her daughter whence the maid presently brought a message to mr jones that her mistress hoped he would excuse the disappointment but an accident had happened which made it impossible for her to have the pleasure of his company at breakfast that day and begged his pardon for not sending him up notice sooner jones desired she would give herself no trouble about anything so trifling as his disappointment that he was heartily sorry for the occasion and that if he could be of any service to her she might command him  he had scarce spoke these words when mrs miller who heard them all suddenly threw open the door and coming out to him in a flood of tears said o mr jones
you are certainly one of the best young men alive
i give you a thousand thanks for your kind offer of your service but alas
sir it is out of your power to preserve my poor girlo my child
my child
she is undone she is ruined for ever  i hope madam said jones no villaino mr jones said she that villain who yesterday left my lodgings hath betrayed my poor girl hath destroyed heri know you are a man of honour
you have a gooda noble heart mr jones
the actions to which i have been myself a witness could proceed from no other
i will tell you all nay indeed it is impossible after what hath happened to keep it a secret
that nightingale that barbarous villain hath undone my daughter
she isshe isoh
mr jones my girl is with child by him and in that condition he hath deserted her
here
here sir is his cruel letter read it mr jones and tell me if such another monster lives  the letter was as follows    dear nancy    as i found it impossible to mention to you what i am afraid will   be no less shocking to you than it is to me i have taken this   method to inform you that my father insists upon my immediately   paying my addresses to a young lady of fortune whom he hath   provided for myi need not write the detested word
your own good   understanding will make you sensible how entirely i am obliged to   an obedience by which i shall be for ever excluded from your dear   arms
the fondness of your mother may encourage you to trust her   with the unhappy consequence of our love which may be easily kept a   secret from the world and for which i will take care to provide as   i will for you
i wish you may feel less on this account than i have   suffered but summon all your fortitude to your assistance and   forgive and forget the man whom nothing but the prospect of certain   ruin could have forced to write this letter
i bid you forget me i   mean only as a lover but the best of friends you shall ever find in   your faithful though unhappy                                                          j
n  when jones had read this letter they both stood silent during a minute looking at each other at last he began thus i cannot express madam how much i am shocked at what i have read yet let me beg you in one particular to take the writer's advice
consider the reputation of your daughterit is gone it is lost mr jones  cryed she as well as her innocence
she received the letter in a room full of company and immediately swooning away upon opening it the contents were known to every one present
but the loss of her reputation bad as it is is not the worst i shall lose my child she hath attempted twice to destroy herself already and though she hath been hitherto prevented vows she will not outlive it nor could i myself outlive any accident of that naturewhat then will become of my little betsy a helpless infant orphan
and the poor little wretch will i believe break her heart at the miseries with which she sees her sister and myself distracted while she is ignorant of the cause
o 'tis the most sensible and bestnatured little thing
the barbarous cruelhath destroyed us all
o my poor children
is this the reward of all my cares
is this the fruit of all my prospects
have i so chearfully undergone all the labours and duties of a mother
have i been so tender of their infancy so careful of their education
have i been toiling so many years denying myself even the conveniences of life to provide some little sustenance for them to lose one or both in such a manner indeed madam said jones with tears in his eyes i pity you from my soulo
mr jones answered she even you though i know the goodness of your heart can have no idea of what i feel
the best the kindest the most dutiful of children
o my poor nancy the darling of my soul
the delight of my eyes
the pride of my heart
too much indeed my pride for to those foolish ambitious hopes arising from her beauty i owe her ruin
alas
i saw with pleasure the liking which this young man had for her
i thought it an honourable affection and flattered my foolish vanity with the thoughts of seeing her married to one so much her superior
and a thousand times in my presence nay often in yours he hath endeavoured to soothe and encourage these hopes by the most generous expressions of disinterested love which he hath always directed to my poor girl and which i as well as she believed to be real
could i have believed that these were only snares laid to betray the innocence of my child and for the ruin of us allat these words little betsy came running into the room crying dear mamma for heaven's sake come to my sister for she is in another fit and my cousin can't hold her mrs miller immediately obeyed the summons but first ordered betsy to stay with mr jones and begged him to entertain her a few minutes saying in the most pathetic voice good heaven
let me preserve one of my children at least  jones in compliance with this request did all he could to comfort the little girl though he was in reality himself very highly affected with mrs miller's story
he told her her sister would be soon very well again that by taking on in that manner she would not only make her sister worse but make her mother ill too indeed sir says she i would not do anything to hurt them for the world
i would burst my heart rather than they should see me crybut my poor sister can't see me cryi am afraid she will never be able to see me cry any more
indeed i can't part with her indeed i can'tand then poor mamma too what will become of hershe says she will die too and leave me but i am resolved i won't be left behind and are you not afraid to die my little betsy said jones
yes answered she i was always afraid to die because i must have left my mamma and my sister but i am not afraid of going anywhere with those i love  jones was so pleased with this answer that he eagerly kissed the child and soon after mrs miller returned saying she thanked heaven nancy was now come to herself
and now betsy says she you may go in for your sister is better and longs to see you she then turned to jones and began to renew her apologies for having disappointed him of his breakfast
i hope madam said jones i shall have a more exquisite repast than any you could have provided for me
this i assure you will be the case if i can do any service to this little family of love
but whatever success may attend my endeavours i am resolved to attempt it
i am very much deceived in mr nightingale if notwithstanding what hath happened he hath not much goodness of heart at the bottom as well as a very violent affection for your daughter
if this be the case i think the picture which i shall lay before him will affect him
endeavour madam to comfort yourself and miss nancy as well as you can
i will go instantly in quest of mr nightingale and i hope to bring you good news  mrs miller fell upon her knees and invoked all the blessings of heaven upon mr jones to which she afterwards added the most passionate expressions of gratitude
he then departed to find mr nightingale and the good woman returned to comfort her daughter who was somewhat cheared at what her mother told her and both joined in resounding the praises of mr jones
chapter vii
the interview between mr jones and mr nightingale
the good or evil we confer on others very often i believe recoils on ourselves
for as men of a benign disposition enjoy their own acts of beneficence equally with those to whom they are done so there are scarce any natures so entirely diabolical as to be capable of doing injuries without paying themselves some pangs for the ruin which they bring on their fellowcreatures
mr nightingale at least was not such a person
on the contrary jones found him in his new lodgings sitting melancholy by the fire and silently lamenting the unhappy situation in which he had placed poor nancy
he no sooner saw his friend appear than he arose hastily to meet him and after much congratulation said nothing could be more opportune than this kind visit for i was never more in the spleen in my life  i am sorry answered jones that i bring news very unlikely to relieve you nay what i am convinced must of all other shock you the most
however it is necessary you should know it
without further preface then i come to you mr nightingale from a worthy family which you have involved in misery and ruin mr nightingale changed colour at these words but jones without regarding it proceeded in the liveliest manner to paint the tragical story with which the reader was acquainted in the last chapter
nightingale never once interrupted the narration though he discovered violent emotions at many parts of it
but when it was concluded after fetching a deep sigh he said what you tell me my friend affects me in the tenderest manner
sure there never was so cursed an accident as the poor girl's betraying my letter
her reputation might otherwise have been safe and the affair might have remained a profound secret and then the girl might have gone off never the worse for many such things happen in this town and if the husband should suspect a little when it is too late it will be his wiser conduct to conceal his suspicion both from his wife and the world  indeed my friend answered jones this could not have been the case with your poor nancy
you have so entirely gained her affections that it is the loss of you and not of her reputation which afflicts her and will end in the destruction of her and her family nay for that matter i promise you cries nightingale she hath my affections so absolutely that my wife whoever she is to be will have very little share in them and is it possible then said jones you can think of deserting her why what can i do  answered the other
ask miss nancy replied jones warmly
in the condition to which you have reduced her i sincerely think she ought to determine what reparation you shall make her
her interest alone and not yours ought to be your sole consideration
but if you ask me what you shall do what can you do less cries jones than fulfil the expectations of her family and her own
nay i sincerely tell you they were mine too ever since i first saw you together
you will pardon me if i presume on the friendship you have favoured me with moved as i am with compassion for those poor creatures
but your own heart will best suggest to you whether you have never intended by your conduct to persuade the mother as well as the daughter into an opinion that you designed honourably and if so though there may have been no direct promise of marriage in the case i will leave to your own good understanding how far you are bound to proceed  nay i must not only confess what you have hinted said nightingale but i am afraid even that very promise you mention i have given  and can you after owning that said jones hesitate a moment  consider my friend answered the other i know you are a man of honour and would advise no one to act contrary to its rules if there were no other objection can i after this publication of her disgrace think of such an alliance with honour undoubtedly  replied jones and the very best and truest honour which is goodness requires it of you
as you mention a scruple of this kind you will give me leave to examine it
can you with honour be guilty of having under false pretences deceived a young woman and her family and of having by these means treacherously robbed her of her innocence
can you with honour be the knowing the wilful occasion nay the artful contriver of the ruin of a human being
can you with honour destroy the fame the peace nay probably both the life and soul too of this creature
can honour bear the thought that this creature is a tender helpless defenceless young woman
a young woman who loves who doats on you who dies for you who hath placed the utmost confidence in your promises and to that confidence hath sacrificed everything which is dear to her
can honour support such contemplations as these a moment  common sense indeed said nightingale warrants all you say but yet you well know the opinion of the world is so contrary to it that was i to marry a whore though my own i should be ashamed of ever showing my face again  fie upon it mr nightingale said jones do not call her by so ungenerous a name when you promised to marry her she became your wife and she hath sinned more against prudence than virtue
and what is this world which you would be ashamed to face but the vile the foolish and the profligate
forgive me if i say such a shame must proceed from false modesty which always attends false honour as its shadowbut i am well assured there is not a man of real sense and goodness in the world who would not honour and applaud the action
but admit no other would would not your own heart my friend applaud it
and do not the warm rapturous sensations which we feel from the consciousness of an honest noble generous benevolent action convey more delight to the mind than the undeserved praise of millions
set the alternative fairly before your eyes
on the one side see this poor unhappy tender believing girl in the arms of her wretched mother breathing her last
hear her breaking heart in agonies sighing out your name and lamenting rather than accusing the cruelty which weighs her down to destruction
paint to your imagination the circumstances of her fond despairing parent driven to madness or perhaps to death by the loss of her lovely daughter
view the poor helpless orphan infant and when your mind hath dwelt a moment only on such ideas consider yourself as the cause of all the ruin of this poor little worthy defenceless family
on the other side consider yourself as relieving them from their temporary sufferings
think with what joy with what transports that lovely creature will fly to your arms
see her blood returning to her pale cheeks her fire to her languid eyes and raptures to her tortured breast
consider the exultations of her mother the happiness of all
think of this little family made by one act of yours completely happy
think of this alternative and sure i am mistaken in my friend if it requires any long deliberation whether he will sink these wretches down for ever or by one generous noble resolution raise them all from the brink of misery and despair to the highest pitch of human happiness
add to this but one consideration more the consideration that it is your duty so to dothat the misery from which you will relieve these poor people is the misery which you yourself have wilfully brought upon them  o my dear friend cries nightingale i wanted not your eloquence to rouse me
i pity poor nancy from my soul and would willingly give anything in my power that no familiarities had ever passed between us
nay believe me i had many struggles with my passion before i could prevail with myself to write that cruel letter which hath caused all the misery in that unhappy family
if i had no inclinations to consult but my own i would marry her tomorrow morning i would by heaven
but you will easily imagine how impossible it would be to prevail on my father to consent to such a match besides he hath provided another for me and tomorrow by his express command i am to wait on the lady  i have not the honour to know your father said jones but suppose he could be persuaded would you yourself consent to the only means of preserving these poor people as eagerly as i would pursue my happiness answered nightingale for i never shall find it in any other womano my dear friend
could you imagine what i have felt within these twelve hours for my poor girl i am convinced she would not engross all your pity
passion leads me only to her and if i had any foolish scruples of honour you have fully satisfied them could my father be induced to comply with my desires nothing would be wanting to compleat my own happiness or that of my nancy  then i am resolved to undertake it said jones
you must not be angry with me in whatever light it may be necessary to set this affair which you may depend on it could not otherwise be long hid from him for things of this nature make a quick progress when once they get abroad as this unhappily hath already
besides should any fatal accident follow as upon my soul i am afraid will unless immediately prevented the public would ring of your name in a manner which if your father hath common humanity must offend him
if you will therefore tell me where i may find the old gentleman i will not lose a moment in the business which while i pursue you cannot do a more generous action than by paying a visit to the poor girl
you will find i have not exaggerated in the account i have given of the wretchedness of the family  nightingale immediately consented to the proposal and now having acquainted jones with his father's lodging and the coffeehouse where he would most probably find him he hesitated a moment and then said my dear tom you are going to undertake an impossibility
if you knew my father you would never think of obtaining his consentstay there is one waysuppose you told him i was already married it might be easier to reconcile him to the fact after it was done and upon my honour i am so affected with what you have said and i love my nancy so passionately i almost wish it was done whatever might be the consequence  jones greatly approved the hint and promised to pursue it
they then separated nightingale to visit his nancy and jones in quest of the old gentleman
chapter viii
what passed between jones and old mr nightingale with the arrival of a person not yet mentioned in this history
notwithstanding the sentiment of the roman satirist which denies the divinity of fortune and the opinion of seneca to the same purpose cicero who was i believe a wiser man than either of them expressly holds the contrary and certain it is there are some incidents in life so very strange and unaccountable that it seems to require more than human skill and foresight in producing them
of this kind was what now happened to jones who found mr nightingale the elder in so critical a minute that fortune if she was really worthy all the worship she received at rome could not have contrived such another
in short the old gentleman and the father of the young lady whom he intended for his son had been hard at it for many hours and the latter was just now gone and had left the former delighted with the thoughts that he had succeeded in a long contention which had been between the two fathers of the future bride and bridegroom in which both endeavoured to overreach the other and as it not rarely happens in such cases both had retreated fully satisfied of having obtained the victory
this gentleman whom mr jones now visited was what they call a man of the world that is to say a man who directs his conduct in this world as one who being fully persuaded there is no other is resolved to make the most of this
in his early years he had been bred to trade but having acquired a very good fortune he had lately declined his business or to speak more properly had changed it from dealing in goods to dealing only in money of which he had always a plentiful fund at command and of which he knew very well how to make a very plentiful advantage sometimes of the necessities of private men and sometimes of those of the public
he had indeed conversed so entirely with money that it may be almost doubted whether he imagined there was any other thing really existing in the world this at least may be certainly averred that he firmly believed nothing else to have any real value
the reader will i fancy allow that fortune could not have culled out a more improper person for mr jones to attack with any probability of success nor could the whimsical lady have directed this attack at a more unseasonable time
as money then was always uppermost in this gentleman's thoughts so the moment he saw a stranger within his doors it immediately occurred to his imagination that such stranger was either come to bring him money or to fetch it from him
and according as one or other of these thoughts prevailed he conceived a favourable or unfavourable idea of the person who approached him
unluckily for jones the latter of these was the ascendant at present for as a young gentleman had visited him the day before with a bill from his son for a play debt he apprehended at the first sight of jones that he was come on such another errand
jones therefore had no sooner told him that he was come on his son's account than the old gentleman being confirmed in his suspicion burst forth into an exclamation that he would lose his labour is it then possible sir answered jones that you can guess my business if i do guess it replied the other i repeat again to you you will lose your labour
what i suppose you are one of those sparks who lead my son into all those scenes of riot and debauchery which will be his destruction
but i shall pay no more of his bills i promise you
i expect he will quit all such company for the future
if i had imagined otherwise i should not have provided a wife for him for i would be instrumental in the ruin of nobody how sir said jones and was this lady of your providing pray sir answered the old gentleman how comes it to be any concern of yoursnay dear sir replied jones be not offended that i interest myself in what regards your son's happiness for whom i have so great an honour and value
it was upon that very account i came to wait upon you
i can't express the satisfaction you have given me by what you say for i do assure you your son is a person for whom i have the highest honournay sir it is not easy to express the esteem i have for you who could be so generous so good so kind so indulgent to provide such a match for your son a woman who i dare swear will make him one of the happiest men upon earth  there is scarce anything which so happily introduces men to our good liking as having conceived some alarm at their first appearance when once those apprehensions begin to vanish we soon forget the fears which they occasioned and look on ourselves as indebted for our present ease to those very persons who at first raised our fears
thus it happened to nightingale who no sooner found that jones had no demand on him as he suspected than he began to be pleased with his presence
pray good sir said he be pleased to sit down
i do not remember to have ever had the pleasure of seeing you before but if you are a friend of my son and have anything to say concerning this young lady i shall be glad to hear you
as to her making him happy it will be his own fault if she doth not
i have discharged my duty in taking care of the main article
she will bring him a fortune capable of making any reasonable prudent sober man happy  undoubtedly cries jones for she is in herself a fortune so beautiful so genteel so sweettempered and so welleducated she is indeed a most accomplished young lady sings admirably well and hath a most delicate hand at the harpsichord i did not know any of these matters answered the old gentleman for i never saw the lady but i do not like her the worse for what you tell me and i am the better pleased with her father for not laying any stress on these qualifications in our bargain
i shall always think it a proof of his understanding
a silly fellow would have brought in these articles as an addition to her fortune but to give him his due he never mentioned any such matter though to be sure they are no disparagements to a woman i do assure you sir cries jones she hath them all in the most eminent degree for my part i own i was afraid you might have been a little backward a little less inclined to the match for your son told me you had never seen the lady therefore i came sir in that case to entreat you to conjure you as you value the happiness of your son not to be averse to his match with a woman who hath not only all the good qualities i have mentioned but many moreif that was your business sir said the old gentleman we are both obliged to you and you may be perfectly easy for i give you my word i was very well satisfied with her fortune sir answered jones i honour you every moment more and more
to be so easily satisfied so very moderate on that account is a proof of the soundness of your understanding as well as the nobleness of your mindnot so very moderate young gentleman not so very moderate answered the fatherstill more and more noble replied jones and give me leave to add sensible for sure it is little less than madness to consider money as the sole foundation of happiness
such a woman as this with her little her nothing of a fortunei find cries the old gentleman you have a pretty just opinion of money my friend or else you are better acquainted with the person of the lady than with her circumstances
why pray what fortune do you imagine this lady to have what fortune cries jones why too contemptible a one to be named for your sonwell well well said the other perhaps he might have done betterthat i deny said jones for she is one of the best of womenay ay but in point of fortune i mean answered the other
and yet as to that now how much do you imagine your friend is to havehow much cries jones how much
why at the utmost perhaps  do you mean to banter me young gentleman said the father a little angry
no upon my soul answered jones i am in earnest nay i believe i have gone to the utmost farthing
if i do the lady an injury i ask her pardon indeed you do cries the father i am certain she hath fifty times that sum and she shall produce fifty to that before i consent that she shall marry my son  nay said jones it is too late to talk of consent now if she had not fifty farthings your son is marriedmy son married answered the old gentleman with surprize
nay said jones i thought you was unacquainted with it my son married to miss harris answered he again
to miss harris said jones no sir to miss nancy miller the daughter of mrs miller at whose house he lodged a young lady who though her mother is reduced to let lodgingsare you bantering or are you in earnest cries the father with a most solemn voice
indeed sir answered jones i scorn the character of a banterer
i came to you in most serious earnest imagining as i find true that your son had never dared acquaint you with a match so much inferior to him in point of fortune though the reputation of the lady will suffer it no longer to remain a secret  while the father stood like one struck suddenly dumb at this news a gentleman came into the room and saluted him by the name of brother
but though these two were in consanguinity so nearly related they were in their dispositions almost the opposites to each other
the brother who now arrived had likewise been bred to trade in which he no sooner saw himself worth  than he purchased a small estate with the greatest part of it and retired into the country where he married the daughter of an unbeneficed clergyman a young lady who though she had neither beauty nor fortune had recommended herself to his choice entirely by her good humour of which she possessed a very large share
with this woman he had during twentyfive years lived a life more resembling the model which certain poets ascribe to the golden age than any of those patterns which are furnished by the present times
by her he had four children but none of them arrived at maturity except only one daughter whom in vulgar language he and his wife had spoiled that is had educated with the utmost tenderness and fondness which she returned to such a degree that she had actually refused a very extraordinary match with a gentleman a little turned of forty because she could not bring herself to part with her parents
the young lady whom mr nightingale had intended for his son was a near neighbour of his brother and an acquaintance of his niece and in reality it was upon the account of his projected match that he was now come to town not indeed to forward but to dissuade his brother from a purpose which he conceived would inevitably ruin his nephew for he foresaw no other event from a union with miss harris notwithstanding the largeness of her fortune as neither her person nor mind seemed to him to promise any kind of matrimonial felicity for she was very tall very thin very ugly very affected very silly and very illnatured
his brother therefore no sooner mentioned the marriage of his nephew with miss miller than he exprest the utmost satisfaction and when the father had very bitterly reviled his son and pronounced sentence of beggary upon him the uncle began in the following manner  if you was a little cooler brother i would ask you whether you love your son for his sake or for your own
you would answer i suppose and so i suppose you think for his sake and doubtless it is his happiness which you intended in the marriage you proposed for him
now brother to prescribe rules of happiness to others hath always appeared to me very absurd and to insist on doing this very tyrannical
it is a vulgar error i know but it is nevertheless an error
and if this be absurd in other things it is mostly so in the affair of marriage the happiness of which depends entirely on the affection which subsists between the parties
i have therefore always thought it unreasonable in parents to desire to chuse for their children on this occasion since to force affection is an impossible attempt nay so much doth love abhor force that i know not whether through an unfortunate but uncurable perverseness in our natures it may not be even impatient of persuasion
it is however true that though a parent will not i think wisely prescribe he ought to be consulted on this occasion and in strictness perhaps should at least have a negative voice
my nephew therefore i own in marrying without asking your advice hath been guilty of a fault
but honestly speaking brother have you not a little promoted this fault
have not your frequent declarations on this subject given him a moral certainty of your refusal where there was any deficiency in point of fortune
nay doth not your present anger arise solely from that deficiency
and if he hath failed in his duty here did you not as much exceed that authority when you absolutely bargained with him for a woman without his knowledge whom you yourself never saw and whom if you had seen and known as well as i it must have been madness in you to have ever thought of bringing her into your family
still i own my nephew in a fault but surely it is not an unpardonable fault
he hath acted indeed without your consent in a matter in which he ought to have asked it but it is in a matter in which his interest is principally concerned you yourself must and will acknowledge that you consulted his interest only and if he unfortunately differed from you and hath been mistaken in his notion of happiness will you brother if you love your son carry him still wider from the point
will you increase the ill consequences of his simple choice
will you endeavour to make an event certain misery to him which may accidentally prove so
in a word brother because he hath put it out of your power to make his circumstances as affluent as you would will you distress them as much as you can  by the force of the true catholic faith st anthony won upon the fishes
orpheus and amphion went a little farther and by the charms of music enchanted things merely inanimate
wonderful both
but neither history nor fable have ever yet ventured to record an instance of any one who by force of argument and reason hath triumphed over habitual avarice
mr nightingale the father instead of attempting to answer his brother contented himself with only observing that they had always differed in their sentiments concerning the education of their children
i wish said he brother you would have confined your care to your own daughter and never have troubled yourself with my son who hath i believe as little profited by your precepts as by your example for young nightingale was his uncle's godson and had lived more with him than with his father
so that the uncle had often declared he loved his nephew almost equally with his own child
jones fell into raptures with this good gentleman and when after much persuasion they found the father grew still more and more irritated instead of appeased jones conducted the uncle to his nephew at the house of mrs miller
chapter ix
containing strange matters
at his return to his lodgings jones found the situation of affairs greatly altered from what they had been in at his departure
the mother the two daughters and young mr nightingale were now sat down to supper together when the uncle was at his own desire introduced without any ceremony into the company to all of whom he was well known for he had several times visited his nephew at that house
the old gentleman immediately walked up to miss nancy saluted and wished her joy as he did afterwards the mother and the other sister and lastly he paid the proper compliments to his nephew with the same good humour and courtesy as if his nephew had married his equal or superior in fortune with all the previous requisites first performed
miss nancy and her supposed husband both turned pale and looked rather foolish than otherwise upon the occasion but mrs miller took the first opportunity of withdrawing and having sent for jones into the diningroom she threw herself at his feet and in a most passionate flood of tears called him her good angel the preserver of her poor little family with many other respectful and endearing appellations and made him every acknowledgment which the highest benefit can extract from the most grateful heart
after the first gust of her passion was a little over which she declared if she had not vented would have burst her she proceeded to inform mr jones that all matters were settled between mr nightingale and her daughter and that they were to be married the next morning at which mr jones having expressed much pleasure the poor woman fell again into a fit of joy and thanksgiving which he at length with difficulty silenced and prevailed on her to return with him back to the company whom they found in the same good humour in which they had left them
this little society now past two or three very agreeable hours together in which the uncle who was a very great lover of his bottle had so well plyed his nephew that this latter though not drunk began to be somewhat flustered and now mr nightingale taking the old gentleman with him upstairs into the apartment he had lately occupied unbosomed himself as follows  as you have been always the best and kindest of uncles to me and as you have shown such unparalleled goodness in forgiving this match which to be sure may be thought a little improvident i should never forgive myself if i attempted to deceive you in anything he then confessed the truth and opened the whole affair
how jack said the old gentleman and are you really then not married to this young woman no upon my honour answered nightingale i have told you the simple truth my dear boy cries the uncle kissing him i am heartily glad to hear it
i never was better pleased in my life
if you had been married i should have assisted you as much as was in my power to have made the best of a bad matter but there is a great difference between considering a thing which is already done and irrecoverable and that which is yet to do
let your reason have fair play jack and you will see this match in so foolish and preposterous a light that there will be no need of any dissuasive arguments how sir replies young nightingale is there this difference between having already done an act and being in honour engaged to do it pugh said the uncle honour is a creature of the world's making and the world hath the power of a creator over it and may govern and direct it as they please
now you well know how trivial these breaches of contract are thought even the grossest make but the wonder and conversation of a day
is there a man who afterwards will be more backward in giving you his sister or daughter
or is there any sister or daughter who would be more backward to receive you
honour is not concerned in these engagements pardon me dear sir cries nightingale i can never think so and not only honour but conscience and humanity are concerned
i am well satisfied that was i now to disappoint the young creature her death would be the consequence and i should look upon myself as her murderer nay as her murderer by the cruellest of all methods by breaking her heart break her heart indeed
no no jack cries the uncle the hearts of women are not so soon broke they are tough boy they are tough but sir answered nightingale my own affections are engaged and i never could be happy with any other woman
how often have i heard you say that children should be always suffered to chuse for themselves and that you would let my cousin harriet do so why ay replied the old gentleman so i would have them but then i would have them chuse wiselyindeed jack you must and shall leave the girlindeed uncle cries the other i must and will have her you will young gentleman said the uncle i did not expect such a word from you
i should not wonder if you had used such language to your father who hath always treated you like a dog and kept you at the distance which a tyrant preserves over his subjects but i who have lived with you upon an equal footing might surely expect better usage but i know how to account for it all it is all owing to your preposterous education in which i have had too little share
there is my daughter now whom i have brought up as my friend never doth anything without my advice nor ever refuses to take it when i give it her you have never yet given her advice in an affair of this kind said nightingale for i am greatly mistaken in my cousin if she would be very ready to obey even your most positive commands in abandoning her inclinations don't abuse my girl answered the old gentleman with some emotion don't abuse my harriet
i have brought her up to have no inclinations contrary to my own
by suffering her to do whatever she pleases i have enured her to a habit of being pleased to do whatever i like pardon me sir said nightingale i have not the least design to reflect on my cousin for whom i have the greatest esteem and indeed i am convinced you will never put her to so severe a tryal or lay such hard commands on her as you would do on mebut dear sir let us return to the company for they will begin to be uneasy at our long absence
i must beg one favour of my dear uncle which is that he would not say anything to shock the poor girl or her mother oh
you need not fear me answered he i understand myself too well to affront women so i will readily grant you that favour and in return i must expect another of you there are but few of your commands sir said nightingale which i shall not very chearfully obey nay sir i ask nothing said the uncle but the honour of your company home to my lodging that i may reason the case a little more fully with you for i would if possible have the satisfaction of preserving my family notwithstanding the headstrong folly of my brother who in his own opinion is the wisest man in the world  nightingale who well knew his uncle to be as headstrong as his father submitted to attend him home and then they both returned back into the room where the old gentleman promised to carry himself with the same decorum which he had before maintained
chapter x
a short chapter which concludes the book
the long absence of the uncle and nephew had occasioned some disquiet in the minds of all whom they had left behind them and the more as during the preceding dialogue the uncle had more than once elevated his voice so as to be heard downstairs which though they could not distinguish what he said had caused some evil foreboding in nancy and her mother and indeed even in jones himself
when the good company therefore again assembled there was a visible alteration in all their faces and the goodhumour which at their last meeting universally shone forth in every countenance was now changed into a much less agreeable aspect
it was a change indeed common enough to the weather in this climate from sunshine to clouds from june to december
this alteration was not however greatly remarked by any present for as they were all now endeavouring to conceal their own thoughts and to act a part they became all too busily engaged in the scene to be spectators of it
thus neither the uncle nor nephew saw any symptoms of suspicion in the mother or daughter nor did the mother or daughter remark the overacted complacence of the old man nor the counterfeit satisfaction which grinned in the features of the young one
something like this i believe frequently happens where the whole attention of two friends being engaged in the part which each is to act in order to impose on the other neither sees nor suspects the arts practised against himself and thus the thrust of both to borrow no improper metaphor on the occasion alike takes place
from the same reason it is no unusual thing for both parties to be overreached in a bargain though the one must be always the greater loser as was he who sold a blind horse and received a bad note in payment
our company in about half an hour broke up and the uncle carried off his nephew but not before the latter had assured miss nancy in a whisper that he would attend her early in the morning and fulfil all his engagements
jones who was the least concerned in this scene saw the most
he did indeed suspect the very fact for besides observing the great alteration in the behaviour of the uncle the distance he assumed and his overstrained civility to miss nancy the carrying off a bridegroom from his bride at that time of night was so extraordinary a proceeding that it could be accounted for only by imagining that young nightingale had revealed the whole truth which the apparent openness of his temper and his being flustered with liquor made too probable
while he was reasoning with himself whether he should acquaint these poor people with his suspicion the maid of the house informed him that a gentlewoman desired to speak with himhe went immediately out and taking the candle from the maid ushered his visitant upstairs who in the person of mrs honour acquainted him with such dreadful news concerning his sophia that he immediately lost all consideration for every other person and his whole stock of compassion was entirely swallowed up in reflections on his own misery and on that of his unfortunate angel
what this dreadful matter was the reader will be informed after we have first related the many preceding steps which produced it and those will be the subject of the following book
book xv
in which the history advances about two days
chapter i
too short to need a preface
there are a set of religious or rather moral writers who teach that virtue is the certain road to happiness and vice to misery in this world
a very wholesome and comfortable doctrine and to which we have but one objection namely that it is not true
indeed if by virtue these writers mean the exercise of those cardinal virtues which like good housewives stay at home and mind only the business of their own family i shall very readily concede the point for so surely do all these contribute and lead to happiness that i could almost wish in violation of all the antient and modern sages to call them rather by the name of wisdom than by that of virtue for with regard to this life no system i conceive was ever wiser than that of the antient epicureans who held this wisdom to constitute the chief good nor foolisher than that of their opposites those modern epicures who place all felicity in the abundant gratification of every sensual appetite
but if by virtue is meant as i almost think it ought a certain relative quality which is always busying itself withoutdoors and seems as much interested in pursuing the good of others as its own i cannot so easily agree that this is the surest way to human happiness because i am afraid we must then include poverty and contempt with all the mischiefs which backbiting envy and ingratitude can bring on mankind in our idea of happiness nay sometimes perhaps we shall be obliged to wait upon the said happiness to a jail since many by the above virtue have brought themselves thither
i have not now leisure to enter upon so large a field of speculation as here seems opening upon me my design was to wipe off a doctrine that lay in my way since while mr jones was acting the most virtuous part imaginable in labouring to preserve his fellowcreatures from destruction the devil or some other evil spirit one perhaps cloathed in human flesh was hard at work to make him completely miserable in the ruin of his sophia
this therefore would seem an exception to the above rule if indeed it was a rule but as we have in our voyage through life seen so many other exceptions to it we chuse to dispute the doctrine on which it is founded which we don't apprehend to be christian which we are convinced is not true and which is indeed destructive of one of the noblest arguments that reason alone can furnish for the belief of immortality
but as the reader's curiosity if he hath any must be now awake and hungry we shall provide to feed it as fast as we can
chapter ii
in which is opened a very black design against sophia
i remember a wise old gentleman who used to say when children are doing nothing they are doing mischief i will not enlarge this quaint saying to the most beautiful part of the creation in general but so far i may be allowed that when the effects of female jealousy do not appear openly in their proper colours of rage and fury we may suspect that mischievous passion to be at work privately and attempting to undermine what it doth not attack aboveground
this was exemplified in the conduct of lady bellaston who under all the smiles which she wore in her countenance concealed much indignation against sophia and as she plainly saw that this young lady stood between her and the full indulgence of her desires she resolved to get rid of her by some means or other nor was it long before a very favourable opportunity of accomplishing this presented itself to her
the reader may be pleased to remember that when sophia was thrown into that consternation at the playhouse by the wit and humour of a set of young gentlemen who call themselves the town we informed him that she had put herself under the protection of a young nobleman who had very safely conducted her to her chair
this nobleman who frequently visited lady bellaston had more than once seen sophia there since her arrival in town and had conceived a very great liking to her which liking as beauty never looks more amiable than in distress sophia had in this fright so encreased that he might now without any great impropriety be said to be actually in love with her
it may easily be believed that he would not suffer so handsome an occasion of improving his acquaintance with the beloved object as now offered itself to elapse when even good breeding alone might have prompted him to pay her a visit
the next morning therefore after this accident he waited on sophia with the usual compliments and hopes that she had received no harm from her last night's adventure
as love like fire when once thoroughly kindled is soon blown into a flame sophia in a very short time compleated her conquest
time now flew away unperceived and the noble lord had been two hours in company with the lady before it entered into his head that he had made too long a visit
though this circumstance alone would have alarmed sophia who was somewhat more a mistress of computation at present she had indeed much more pregnant evidence from the eyes of her lover of what past within his bosom nay though he did not make any open declaration of his passion yet many of his expressions were rather too warm and too tender to have been imputed to complacence even in the age when such complacence was in fashion the very reverse of which is well known to be the reigning mode at present
lady bellaston had been apprized of his lordship's visit at his first arrival and the length of it very well satisfied her that things went as she wished and as indeed she had suspected the second time she saw this young couple together
this business she rightly i think concluded that she should by no means forward by mixing in the company while they were together she therefore ordered her servants that when my lord was going they should tell him she desired to speak with him and employed the intermediate time in meditating how best to accomplish a scheme which she made no doubt but his lordship would very readily embrace the execution of
lord fellamar for that was the title of this young nobleman was no sooner introduced to her ladyship than she attacked him in the following strain bless me my lord are you here yet
i thought my servants had made a mistake and let you go away and i wanted to see you about an affair of some importanceindeed lady bellaston  said he i don't wonder you are astonished at the length of my visit for i have staid above two hours and i did not think i had staid above halfaonewhat am i to conclude from thence my lord said she
the company must be very agreeable which can make time slide away so very deceitfullyupon my honour said he the most agreeable i ever saw
pray tell me lady bellaston who is this blazing star which you have produced among us all of a suddenwhat blazing star my lord said she affecting a surprize
i mean said he the lady i saw here the other day whom i had last night in my arms at the playhouse and to whom i have been making that unreasonable visito my cousin western said she why that blazing star my lord is the daughter of a country booby squire and hath been in town about a fortnight for the first timeupon my soul said he i should swear she had been bred up in a court for besides her beauty i never saw anything so genteel so sensible so politeo brave cries the lady my cousin hath you i findupon my honour answered he i wish she had for i am in love with her to distractionnay my lord said she it is not wishing yourself very ill neither for she is a very great fortune i assure you she is an only child and her father's estate is a good  ayear then i can assure you madam answered the lord i think her the best match in england  indeed my lord replied she if you like her i heartily wish you had her if you think so kindly of me madam said he as she is a relation of yours will you do me the honour to propose it to her father and are you really then in earnest cries the lady with an affected gravity
i hope madam answered he you have a better opinion of me than to imagine i would jest with your ladyship in an affair of this kind indeed then said the lady i will most readily propose your lordship to her father and i can i believe assure you of his joyful acceptance of the proposal but there is a bar which i am almost ashamed to mention and yet it is one you will never be able to conquer
you have a rival my lord and a rival who though i blush to name him neither you nor all the world will ever be able to conquer upon my word lady bellaston cries he you have struck a damp to my heart which hath almost deprived me of being fie my lord said she i should rather hope i had struck fire into you
a lover and talk of damps in your heart
i rather imagined you would have asked your rival's name that you might have immediately entered the lists with him i promise you madam  answered he there are very few things i would not undertake for your charming cousin but pray who is this happy manwhy he is said she what i am sorry to say most happy men with us are one of the lowest fellows in the world
he is a beggar a bastard a foundling a fellow in meaner circumstances than one of your lordship's footmen and is it possible cried he that a young creature with such perfections should think of bestowing herself so unworthily alas
my lord answered she consider the countrythe bane of all young women is the country
there they learn a set of romantic notions of love and i know not what folly which this town and good company can scarce eradicate in a whole winter  indeed madam replied my lord your cousin is of too immense a value to be thrown away such ruin as this must be prevented  alas cries she my lord how can it be prevented
the family have already done all in their power but the girl is i think intoxicated and nothing less than ruin will content her
and to deal more openly with you i expect every day to hear she is run away with him what you tell me lady bellaston answered his lordship affects me most tenderly and only raises my compassion instead of lessening my adoration of your cousin
some means must be found to preserve so inestimable a jewel
hath your ladyship endeavoured to reason with her here the lady affected a laugh and cried my dear lord sure you know us better than to talk of reasoning a young woman out of her inclinations
these inestimable jewels are as deaf as the jewels they wear time my lord time is the only medicine to cure their folly but this is a medicine which i am certain she will not take nay i live in hourly horrors on her account
in short nothing but violent methods will do what is to be done cries my lord what methods are to be takenis there any method upon earthoh
lady bellaston
there is nothing which i would not undertake for such a rewardi really know not answered the lady after a pause and then pausing again she cried outupon my soul i am at my wit's end on this girl's accountif she can be preserved something must be done immediately and as i say nothing but violent methods will doif your lordship hath really this attachment to my cousin and to do her justice except in this silly inclination of which she will soon see her folly she is every way deserving i think there may be one way indeed it is a very disagreeable one and what i am almost afraid to think ofit requires a great spirit i promise you i am not conscious madam said he of any defect there nor am i i hope suspected of any such
it must be an egregious defect indeed which could make me backward on this occasion nay my lord answered she i am so far from doubting you i am much more inclined to doubt my own courage for i must run a monstrous risque
in short i must place such a confidence in your honour as a wise woman will scarce ever place in a man on any consideration in this point likewise my lord very well satisfied her for his reputation was extremely clear and common fame did him no more than justice in speaking well of him
well then said she my lordii vow i can't bear the apprehension of itno it must not beat least every other method shall be tried
can you get rid of your engagements and dine here today
your lordship will have an opportunity of seeing a little more of miss westerni promise you we have no time to lose
here will be nobody but lady betty and miss eagle and colonel hampsted and tom edwards they will all go soonand i shall be at home to nobody
then your lordship may be a little more explicit
nay i will contrive some method to convince you of her attachment to this fellow my lord made proper compliments accepted the invitation and then they parted to dress it being now past three in the morning or to reckon by the old style in the afternoon
chapter iii
a further explanation of the foregoing design
though the reader may have long since concluded lady bellaston to be a member and no inconsiderable one of the great world she was in reality a very considerable member of the little world by which appellation was distinguished a very worthy and honourable society which not long since flourished in this kingdom
among other good principles upon which this society was founded there was one very remarkable for as it was a rule of an honourable club of heroes who assembled at the close of the late war that all the members should every day fight once at least so 'twas in this that every member should within the twentyfour hours tell at least one merry fib which was to be propagated by all the brethren and sisterhood
many idle stories were told about this society which from a certain quality may be perhaps not unjustly supposed to have come from the society themselves
as that the devil was the president and that he sat in person in an elbowchair at the upper end of the table but upon very strict enquiry i find there is not the least truth in any of those tales and that the assembly consisted in reality of a set of very good sort of people and the fibs which they propagated were of a harmless kind and tended only to produce mirth and good humour
edwards was likewise a member of this comical society
to him therefore lady bellaston applied as a proper instrument for her purpose and furnished him with a fib which he was to vent whenever the lady gave him her cue and this was not to be till the evening when all the company but lord fellamar and himself were gone and while they were engaged in a rubber at whist
to this time then which was between seven and eight in the evening we will convey our reader when lady bellaston lord fellamar miss western and tom being engaged at whist and in the last game of their rubbers tom received his cue from lady bellaston which was i protest tom you are grown intolerable lately you used to tell us all the news of the town and now you know no more of the world than if you lived out of it  mr edwards then began as follows the fault is not mine madam it lies in the dulness of the age that doth nothing worth talking ofo la
though now i think on't there hath a terrible accident befallen poor colonel wilcoxpoor nedyou know him my lord everybody knows him faith
i am very much concerned for him  what is it pray says lady bellaston
why he hath killed a man this morning in a duel that's all  his lordship who was not in the secret asked gravely whom he had killed
to which edwards answered a young fellow we none of us know a somersetshire lad just came to town one jones his name is a near relation of one mr allworthy of whom your lordship i believe hath heard
i saw the lad lie dead in a coffeehouseupon my soul he is one of the finest corpses i ever saw in my life  sophia who had just began to deal as tom had mentioned that a man was killed stopt her hand and listened with attention for all stories of that kind affected her but no sooner had he arrived at the latter part of the story than she began to deal again and having dealt three cards to one and seven to another and ten to a third at last dropt the rest from her hand and fell back in her chair
the company behaved as usually on these occasions
the usual disturbance ensued the usual assistance was summoned and sophia at last as it is usual returned again to life and was soon after at her earnest desire led to her own apartment where at my lord's request lady bellaston acquainted her with the truth attempted to carry it off as a jest of her own and comforted her with repeated assurances that neither his lordship nor tom though she had taught him the story were in the true secret of the affair
there was no farther evidence necessary to convince lord fellamar how justly the case had been represented to him by lady bellaston and now at her return into the room a scheme was laid between these two noble persons which though it appeared in no very heinous light to his lordship as he faithfully promised and faithfully resolved too to make the lady all the subsequent amends in his power by marriage yet many of our readers we doubt not will see with just detestation
the next evening at seven was appointed for the fatal purpose when lady bellaston undertook that sophia should be alone and his lordship should be introduced to her
the whole family were to be regulated for the purpose most of the servants despatched out of the house and for mrs honour who to prevent suspicion was to be left with her mistress till his lordship's arrival lady bellaston herself was to engage her in an apartment as distant as possible from the scene of the intended mischief and out of the hearing of sophia
matters being thus agreed on his lordship took his leave and her ladyship retired to rest highly pleased with a project of which she had no reason to doubt the success and which promised so effectually to remove sophia from being any further obstruction to her amour with jones by a means of which she should never appear to be guilty even if the fact appeared to the world but this she made no doubt of preventing by huddling up a marriage to which she thought the ravished sophia would easily be brought to consent and at which all the rest of her family would rejoice
but affairs were not in so quiet a situation in the bosom of the other conspirator his mind was tost in all the distracting anxiety so nobly described by shakespear        between the acting of a dreadful thing       and the first motion all the interim is       like a phantasma or a hideous dream       the genius and the mortal instruments       are then in council and the state of man       like to a little kingdom suffers then       the nature of an insurrection  though the violence of his passion had made him eagerly embrace the first hint of this design especially as it came from a relation of the lady yet when that friend to reflection a pillow had placed the action itself in all its natural black colours before his eyes with all the consequences which must and those which might probably attend it his resolution began to abate or rather indeed to go over to the other side and after a long conflict which lasted a whole night between honour and appetite the former at length prevailed and he determined to wait on lady bellaston and to relinquish the design
lady bellaston was in bed though very late in the morning and sophia sitting by her bedside when the servant acquainted her that lord fellamar was below in the parlour upon which her ladyship desired him to stay and that she would see him presently but the servant was no sooner departed than poor sophia began to intreat her cousin not to encourage the visits of that odious lord so she called him though a little unjustly upon her account
i see his design said she for he made downright love to me yesterday morning but as i am resolved never to admit it i beg your ladyship not to leave us alone together any more and to order the servants that if he enquires for me i may be always denied to him  la
child says lady bellaston you country girls have nothing but sweethearts in your head you fancy every man who is civil to you is making love
he is one of the most gallant young fellows about town and i am convinced means no more than a little gallantry
make love to you indeed
i wish with all my heart he would and you must be an arrant mad woman to refuse him  but as i shall certainly be that mad woman cries sophia i hope his visits shall not be intruded upon me  o child said lady bellaston you need not be so fearful if you resolve to run away with that jones i know no person who can hinder you  upon my honour madam cries sophia your ladyship injures me
i will never run away with any man nor will i ever marry contrary to my father's inclinations  well miss western said the lady if you are not in a humour to see company this morning you may retire to your own apartment for i am not frightened at his lordship and must send for him up into my dressingroom  sophia thanked her ladyship and withdrew and presently afterwards fellamar was admitted upstairs
chapter iv
by which it will appear how dangerous an advocate a lady is when she applies her eloquence to an ill purpose
when lady bellaston heard the young lord's scruples she treated them with the same disdain with which one of those sages of the law called newgate solicitors treats the qualms of conscience in a young witness
my dear lord said she you certainly want a cordial
i must send to lady edgely for one of her best drams
fie upon it
have more resolution
are you frightened by the word rape
or are you apprehensive
well
if the story of helen was modern i should think it unnatural
i mean the behaviour of paris not the fondness of the lady for all women love a man of spirit
there is another story of the sabine ladiesand that too i thank heaven is very antient
your lordship perhaps will admire my reading but i think mr hook tells us they made tolerable good wives afterwards
i fancy few of my married acquaintance were ravished by their husbands nay dear lady bellaston cried he don't ridicule me in this manner why my good lord answered she do you think any woman in england would not laugh at you in her heart whatever prudery she might wear in her countenanceyou force me to use a strange kind of language and to betray my sex most abominably but i am contented with knowing my intentions are good and that i am endeavouring to serve my cousin for i think you will make her a husband notwithstanding this or upon my soul i would not even persuade her to fling herself away upon an empty title
she should not upbraid me hereafter with having lost a man of spirit for that his enemies allow this poor young fellow to be  let those who have had the satisfaction of hearing reflections of this kind from a wife or a mistress declare whether they are at all sweetened by coming from a female tongue
certain it is they sunk deeper into his lordship than anything which demosthenes or cicero could have said on the occasion
lady bellaston perceiving she had fired the young lord's pride began now like a true orator to rouse other passions to its assistance
my lord says she in a graver voice you will be pleased to remember you mentioned this matter to me first for i would not appear to you in the light of one who is endeavouring to put off my cousin upon you
fourscore thousand pounds do not stand in need of an advocate to recommend them nor doth miss western said he require any recommendation from her fortune for in my opinion no woman ever had half her charms yes yes my lord replied the lady looking in the glass there have been women with more than half her charms i assure you not that i need lessen her on that account she is a most delicious girl that's certain and within these few hours she will be in the arms of one who surely doth not deserve her though i will give him his due i believe he is truly a man of spirit  i hope so madam said my lord though i must own he doth not deserve her for unless heaven or your ladyship disappoint me she shall within that time be in mine  well spoken my lord answered the lady i promise you no disappointment shall happen from my side and within this week i am convinced i shall call your lordship my cousin in public  the remainder of this scene consisted entirely of raptures excuses and compliments very pleasant to have heard from the parties but rather dull when related at second hand
here therefore we shall put an end to this dialogue and hasten to the fatal hour when everything was prepared for the destruction of poor sophia
but this being the most tragical matter in our whole history we shall treat it in a chapter by itself
chapter v  containing some matters which may affect and others which may surprize the reader
the clock had now struck seven and poor sophia alone and melancholy sat reading a tragedy
it was the fatal marriage and she was now come to that part where the poor distrest isabella disposes of her weddingring
here the book dropt from her hand and a shower of tears ran down into her bosom
in this situation she had continued a minute when the door opened and in came lord fellamar
sophia started from her chair at his entrance and his lordship advancing forwards and making a low bow said i am afraid miss western i break in upon you abruptly  indeed my lord says she i must own myself a little surprized at this unexpected visit if this visit be unexpected madam answered lord fellamar my eyes must have been very faithless interpreters of my heart when last i had the honour of seeing you for surely you could not otherwise have hoped to detain my heart in your possession without receiving a visit from its owner sophia confused as she was answered this bombast and very properly i think with a look of inconceivable disdain
my lord then made another and a longer speech of the same sort
upon which sophia trembling said am i really to conceive your lordship to be out of your senses
sure my lord there is no other excuse for such behaviour i am indeed madam in the situation you suppose cries his lordship and sure you will pardon the effects of a frenzy which you yourself have occasioned for love hath so totally deprived me of reason that i am scarce accountable for any of my actions upon my word my lord said sophia i neither understand your words nor your behaviour suffer me then madam cries he at your feet to explain both by laying open my soul to you and declaring that i doat on you to the highest degree of distraction
o most adorable most divine creature
what language can express the sentiments of my heart i do assure you my lord said sophia i shall not stay to hear any more of this do not cries he think of leaving me thus cruelly could you know half the torments which i feel that tender bosom must pity what those eyes have caused then fetching a deep sigh and laying hold of her hand he ran on for some minutes in a strain which would be little more pleasing to the reader than it was to the lady and at last concluded with a declaration that if he was master of the world he would lay it at her feet sophia then forcibly pulling away her hand from his answered with much spirit i promise you sir your world and its master i should spurn from me with equal contempt she then offered to go and lord fellamar again laying hold of her hand said pardon me my beloved angel freedoms which nothing but despair could have tempted me to takebelieve me could i have had any hope that my title and fortune neither of them inconsiderable unless when compared with your worth would have been accepted i had in the humblest manner presented them to your acceptancebut i cannot lose youby heaven i will sooner part with my soulyou are you must you shall be only mine my lord says she i intreat you to desist from a vain pursuit for upon my honour i will never hear you on this subject
let go my hand my lord for i am resolved to go from you this moment nor will i ever see you more then madam cries his lordship i must make the best use of this moment for i cannot live nor will i live without youwhat do you mean my lord  said sophia i will raise the family i have no fear madam  answered he but of losing you and that i am resolved to prevent the only way which despair points to mehe then caught her in his arms upon which she screamed so loud that she must have alarmed some one to her assistance had not lady bellaston taken care to remove all ears
but a more lucky circumstance happened for poor sophia another noise now broke forth which almost drowned her cries for now the whole house rang with where is she
dn me i'll unkennel her this instant
show me her chamber i say
where is my daughter
i know she's in the house and i'll see her if she's aboveground
show me where she isat which last words the door flew open and in came squire western with his parson and a set of myrmidons at his heels
how miserable must have been the condition of poor sophia when the enraged voice of her father was welcome to her ears
welcome indeed it was and luckily did he come for it was the only accident upon earth which could have preserved the peace of her mind from being for ever destroyed
sophia notwithstanding her fright presently knew her father's voice and his lordship notwithstanding his passion knew the voice of reason which peremptorily assured him it was not now a time for the perpetration of his villany
hearing therefore the voice approach and hearing likewise whose it was for as the squire more than once roared forth the word daughter so sophia in the midst of her struggling cried out upon her father he thought proper to relinquish his prey having only disordered her handkerchief and with his rude lips committed violence on her lovely neck
if the reader's imagination doth not assist me i shall never be able to describe the situation of these two persons when western came into the room
sophia tottered into a chair where she sat disordered pale breathless bursting with indignation at lord fellamar affrighted and yet more rejoiced at the arrival of her father
his lordship sat down near her with the bag of his wig hanging over one of his shoulders the rest of his dress being somewhat disordered and rather a greater proportion of linen than is usual appearing at his bosom
as to the rest he was amazed affrighted vexed and ashamed
as to squire western he happened at this time to be overtaken by an enemy which very frequently pursues and seldom fails to overtake most of the country gentlemen in this kingdom
he was literally speaking drunk which circumstance together with his natural impetuosity could produce no other effect than his running immediately up to his daughter upon whom he fell foul with his tongue in the most inveterate manner nay he had probably committed violence with his hands had not the parson interposed saying for heaven's sake sir animadvert that you are in the house of a great lady
let me beg you to mitigate your wrath it should minister a fulness of satisfaction that you have found your daughter for as to revenge it belongeth not unto us
i discern great contrition in the countenance of the young lady
i stand assured if you will forgive her she will repent her of all past offences and return unto her duty  the strength of the parson's arms had at first been of more service than the strength of his rhetoric
however his last words wrought some effect and the squire answered i'll forgee her if she wull ha un
if wot ha un sophy i'll forgee thee all
why dost unt speak
shat ha un
dn me shat ha un
why dost unt answer
was ever such a stubborn tuoad  let me intreat you sir to be a little more moderate said the parson you frighten the young lady so that you deprive her of all power of utterance  power of mine a answered the squire
you take her part then you do
a pretty parson truly to side with an undutiful child
yes yes i will gee you a living with a pox
i'll gee un to the devil sooner  i humbly crave your pardon said the parson i assure your worship i meant no such matter  my lady bellaston now entered the room and came up to the squire who no sooner saw her than resolving to follow the instructions of his sister he made her a very civil bow in the rural manner and paid her some of his best compliments
he then immediately proceeded to his complaints and said there my lady cousin there stands the most undutiful child in the world she hankers after a beggarly rascal and won't marry one of the greatest matches in all england that we have provided for her  indeed cousin western answered the lady i am persuaded you wrong my cousin
i am sure she hath a better understanding
i am convinced she will not refuse what she must be sensible is so much to her advantage  this was a wilful mistake in lady bellaston for she well knew whom mr western meant though perhaps she thought he would easily be reconciled to his lordship's proposals
do you hear there quoth the squire what her ladyship says
all your family are for the match
come sophy be a good girl and be dutiful and make your father happy  if my death will make you happy sir answered sophia you will shortly be so  it's a lye sophy it's a dn'd lye and you know it said the squire
indeed miss western said lady bellaston you injure your father he hath nothing in view but your interest in this match and i and all your friends must acknowledge the highest honour done to your family in the proposal  ay all of us quoth the squire nay it was no proposal of mine
she knows it was her aunt proposed it to me firstcome sophy once more let me beg you to be a good girl and gee me your consent before your cousin  let me give him your hand cousin said the lady
it is the fashion nowadays to dispense with time and long courtships  pugh said the squire what signifies time won't they have time enough to court afterwards
people may court very well after they have been abed together  as lord fellamar was very well assured that he was meant by lady bellaston so never having heard nor suspected a word of blifil he made no doubt of his being meant by the father
coming up therefore to the squire he said though i have not the honour sir of being personally known to you yet as i find i have the happiness to have my proposals accepted let me intercede sir in behalf of the young lady that she may not be more solicited at this time  you intercede sir said the squire why who the devil are you  sir i am lord fellamar answered he and am the happy man whom i hope you have done the honour of accepting for a soninlaw  you are a son of a b replied the squire for all your laced coat
you my soninlaw and be dn'd to you  i shall take more from you sir than from any man answered the lord but i must inform you that i am not used to hear such language without resentment  resent my a quoth the squire
don't think i am afraid of such a fellow as thee art
because hast got a spit there dangling at thy side
lay by your spit and i'll give thee enough of meddling with what doth not belong to thee
i'll teach you to fatherinlaw me
i'll lick thy jacket  it's very well sir said my lord i shall make no disturbance before the ladies
i am very well satisfied
your humble servant sir lady bellaston your most obedient  his lordship was no sooner gone than lady bellaston coming up to mr western said bless me sir what have you done
you know not whom you have affronted he is a nobleman of the first rank and fortune and yesterday made proposals to your daughter and such as i am sure you must accept with the highest pleasure  answer for yourself lady cousin said the squire i will have nothing to do with any of your lords
my daughter shall have an honest country gentleman i have pitched upon one for herand she shall ha' uni am sorry for the trouble she hath given your ladyship with all my heart lady bellaston made a civil speech upon the word trouble to which the squire answeredwhy that's kindand i would do as much for your ladyship
to be sure relations should do for one another
so i wish your ladyship a good nightcome madam you must go along with me by fair means or i'll have you carried down to the coach  sophia said she would attend him without force but begged to go in a chair for she said she should not be able to ride any other way
prithee cries the squire wout unt persuade me canst not ride in a coach wouldst
that's a pretty thing surely
no no i'll never let thee out of my sight any more till art married that i promise thee  sophia told him she saw he was resolved to break her heart
o break thy heart and be dn'd quoth he if a good husband will break it
i don't value a brass varden not a halfpenny of any undutiful b upon earth he then took violent hold of her hand upon which the parson once more interfered begging him to use gentle methods
at that the squire thundered out a curse and bid the parson hold his tongue saying at'nt in pulpit now
when art a got up there i never mind what dost say but i won't be priestridden nor taught how to behave myself by thee
i wish your ladyship a goodnight
come along sophy be a good girl and all shall be well
shat ha' un dn me shat ha' un  mrs honour appeared belowstairs and with a low curtesy to the squire offered to attend her mistress but he pushed her away saying hold madam hold you come no more near my house and will you take my maid away from me said sophia
yes indeed madam will i cries the squire you need not fear being without a servant i will get you another maid and a better maid than this who i'd lay five pounds to a crown is no more a maid than my grannum
no no sophy she shall contrive no more escapes i promise you he then packed up his daughter and the parson into the hackney coach after which he mounted himself and ordered it to drive to his lodgings
in the way thither he suffered sophia to be quiet and entertained himself with reading a lecture to the parson on good manners and a proper behaviour to his betters
it is possible he might not so easily have carried off his daughter from lady bellaston had that good lady desired to have detained her but in reality she was not a little pleased with the confinement into which sophia was going and as her project with lord fellamar had failed of success she was well contented that other violent methods were now going to be used in favour of another man
chapter vi
by what means the squire came to discover his daughter
though the reader in many histories is obliged to digest much more unaccountable appearances than this of mr western without any satisfaction at all yet as we dearly love to oblige him whenever it is in our power we shall now proceed to shew by what method the squire discovered where his daughter was
in the third chapter then of the preceding book we gave a hint for it is not our custom to unfold at any time more than is necessary for the occasion that mrs fitzpatrick who was very desirous of reconciling her uncle and aunt western thought she had a probable opportunity by the service of preserving sophia from committing the same crime which had drawn on herself the anger of her family
after much deliberation therefore she resolved to inform her aunt western where her cousin was and accordingly she writ the following letter which we shall give the reader at length for more reasons than one
honoured madam    the occasion of my writing this will perhaps make a letter of mine   agreeable to my dear aunt for the sake of one of her nieces though   i have little reason to hope it will be so on the account of   another
without more apology as i was coming to throw my unhappy self at   your feet i met by the strangest accident in the world my cousin   sophy whose history you are better acquainted with than myself   though alas
i know infinitely too much enough indeed to satisfy   me that unless she is immediately prevented she is in danger of   running into the same fatal mischief which by foolishly and   ignorantly refusing your most wise and prudent advice i have   unfortunately brought on myself
in short i have seen the man nay i was most part of yesterday in   his company and a charming young fellow i promise you he is
by   what accident he came acquainted with me is too tedious to tell you   now but i have this morning changed my lodgings to avoid him lest   he should by my means discover my cousin for he doth not yet know   where she is and it is adviseable he should not till my uncle hath   secured herno time therefore is to be lost and i need only   inform you that she is now with lady bellaston whom i have seen   and who hath i find a design of concealing her from her family
you know madam she is a strange woman but nothing could misbecome   me more than to presume to give any hint to one of your great   understanding and great knowledge of the world besides barely   informing you of the matter of fact
i hope madam the care which i have shewn on this occasion for the   good of my family will recommend me again to the favour of a lady   who hath always exerted so much zeal for the honour and true   interest of us all and that it may be a means of restoring me to   your friendship which hath made so great a part of my former and   is so necessary to my future happiness
i am                  with the utmost respect                     honoured madam                        your most dutiful obliged niece                            and most obedient humble                                  servant                                       harriet fitzpatrick  mrs western was now at her brother's house where she had resided ever since the flight of sophia in order to administer comfort to the poor squire in his affliction
of this comfort which she doled out to him in daily portions we have formerly given a specimen
she was now standing with her back to the fire and with a pinch of snuff in her hand was dealing forth this daily allowance of comfort to the squire while he smoaked his afternoon pipe when she received the above letter which she had no sooner read than she delivered it to him saying there sir there is an account of your lost sheep
fortune hath again restored her to you and if you will be governed by my advice it is possible you may yet preserve her  the squire had no sooner read the letter than he leaped from his chair threw his pipe into the fire and gave a loud huzza for joy
he then summoned his servants called for his boots and ordered the chevalier and several other horses to be saddled and that parson supple should be immediately sent for
having done this he turned to his sister caught her in his arms and gave her a close embrace saying zounds
you don't seem pleased one would imagine you was sorry i have found the girl  brother answered she the deepest politicians who see to the bottom discover often a very different aspect of affairs from what swims on the surface
it is true indeed things do look rather less desperate than they did formerly in holland when lewis the fourteenth was at the gates of amsterdam but there is a delicacy required in this matter which you will pardon me brother if i suspect you want
there is a decorum to be used with a woman of figure such as lady bellaston brother which requires a knowledge of the world superior i am afraid to yours  sister cries the squire i know you have no opinion of my parts but i'll shew you on this occasion who is a fool
knowledge quotha
i have not been in the country so long without having some knowledge of warrants and the law of the land
i know i may take my own wherever i can find it
shew me my own daughter and if i don't know how to come at her i'll suffer you to call me a fool as long as i live
there be justices of peace in london as well as in other places  i protest cries she you make me tremble for the event of this matter which if you will proceed by my advice you may bring to so good an issue
do you really imagine brother that the house of a woman of figure is to be attacked by warrants and brutal justices of the peace
i will inform you how to proceed
as soon as you arrive in town and have got yourself into a decent dress for indeed brother you have none at present fit to appear in you must send your compliments to lady bellaston and desire leave to wait on her
when you are admitted to her presence as you certainly will be and have told her your story and have made proper use of my name for i think you just know one another only by sight though you are relations i am confident she will withdraw her protection from my niece who hath certainly imposed upon her
this is the only methodjustices of peace indeed
do you imagine any such event can arrive to a woman of figure in a civilised nation  dn their figures cries the squire a pretty civilised nation truly where women are above the law
and what must i stand sending a parcel of compliments to a confounded whore that keeps away a daughter from her own natural father
i tell you sister i am not so ignorant as you think mei know you would have women above the law but it is all a lye i heard his lordship say at size that no one is above the law
but this of yours is hanover law i suppose  mr western said she i think you daily improve in ignorancei protest you are grown an arrant bear  no more a bear than yourself sister western said the squirepox
you may talk of your civility an you will i am sure you never shew any to me
i am no bear no nor no dog neither though i know somebody that is something that begins with a b but pox
i will show you i have got more good manners than some folks  mr western answered the lady you may say what you please je vous mesprise de tout mon coeur i shall not therefore be angrybesides as my cousin with that odious irish name justly says i have that regard for the honour and true interest of my family and that concern for my niece who is a part of it that i have resolved to go to town myself upon this occasion for indeed indeed brother you are not a fit minister to be employed at a polite courtgreenlandgreenland should always be the scene of the tramontane negociation  i thank heaven cries the squire i don't understand you now
you are got to your hanoverian linguo
however i'll shew you i scorn to be behindhand in civility with you and as you are not angry for what i have said so i am not angry for what you have said
indeed i have always thought it a folly for relations to quarrel and if they do now and then give a hasty word why people should give and take for my part i never bear malice and i take it very kind of you to go up to london for i never was there but twice in my life and then i did not stay above a fortnight at a time and to be sure i can't be expected to know much of the streets and the folks in that time
i never denied that you know'd all these matters better than i
for me to dispute that would be all as one as for you to dispute the management of a pack of dogs or the finding a hare sitting with mewhich i promise you says she i never willwell and i promise you  returned he that i never will dispute the t'other  here then a league was struck to borrow a phrase from the lady between the contending parties and now the parson arriving and the horses being ready the squire departed having promised his sister to follow her advice and she prepared to follow him the next day
but having communicated these matters to the parson on the road they both agreed that the prescribed formalities might very well be dispensed with and the squire having changed his mind proceeded in the manner we have already seen
chapter vii
in which various misfortunes befel poor jones
affairs were in the aforesaid situation when mrs honour arrived at mrs miller's and called jones out from the company as we have before seen with whom when she found herself alone she began as follows  o my dear sir
how shall i get spirits to tell you you are undone sir and my poor lady's undone and i am undone hath anything happened to sophia cries jones staring like a madman
all that is bad cries honour oh i shall never get such another lady
oh that i should ever live to see this day at these words jones turned pale as ashes trembled and stammered but honour went ono
mr jones i have lost my lady for ever how
what
for heaven's sake tell me
o my dear sophia you may well call her so said honour she was the dearest lady to me
i shall never have such another placedn your place cries jones where iswhatwhat is become of my sophia ay to be sure cries she servants may be dn'd
it signifies nothing what becomes of them though they are turned away and ruined ever so much
to be sure they are not flesh and blood like other people
no to be sure it signifies nothing what becomes of them if you have any pity any compassion cries jones i beg you will instantly tell me what hath happened to sophia to be sure i have more pity for you than you have for me answered honour i don't dn you because you have lost the sweetest lady in the world
to be sure you are worthy to be pitied and i am worthy to be pitied too for to be sure if ever there was a good mistress  what hath happened cries jones in almost a raving fit
whatwhat said honour why the worst that could have happened both for you and for meher father is come to town and hath carried her away from us both here jones fell on his knees in thanksgiving that it was no worse
no worse repeated honour what could be worse for either of us
he carried her off swearing she should marry mr blifil that's for your comfort and for poor me i am turned out of doors indeed mrs honour answered jones you frightened me out of my wits
i imagined some most dreadful sudden accident had happened to sophia something compared to which even seeing her married to blifil would be a trifle but while there is life there are hopes my dear honour
women in this land of liberty cannot be married by actual brutal force to be sure sir said she that's true
there may be some hopes for you but alackaday
what hopes are there for poor me
and to be sure sir you must be sensible i suffer all this upon your account
all the quarrel the squire hath to me is for taking your part as i have done against mr blifil indeed mrs honour answered he i am sensible of my obligations to you and will leave nothing in my power undone to make you amends alas
sir said she what can make a servant amends for the loss of one place but the getting another altogether as good do not despair mrs honour said jones i hope to reinstate you again in the same  alackaday sir said she how can i flatter myself with such hopes when i know it is a thing impossible
for the squire is so set against me and yet if you should ever have my lady as to be sure i now hopes heartily you will for you are a generous goodnatured gentleman and i am sure you loves her and to be sure she loves you as dearly as her own soul it is a matter in vain to deny it because as why everybody that is in the least acquainted with my lady must see it for poor dear lady she can't dissemble and if two people who loves one another a'n't happy why who should be so
happiness don't always depend upon what people has besides my lady has enough for both
to be sure therefore as one may say it would be all the pity in the world to keep two such loviers asunder nay i am convinced for my part you will meet together at last for if it is to be there is no preventing it
if a marriage is made in heaven all the justices of peace upon earth can't break it off
to be sure i wishes that parson supple had but a little more spirit to tell the squire of his wickedness in endeavouring to force his daughter contrary to her liking but then his whole dependance is on the squire and so the poor gentleman though he is a very religious good sort of man and talks of the badness of such doings behind the squire's back yet he dares not say his soul is his own to his face
to be sure i never saw him make so bold as just now i was afeard the squire would have struck him
i would not have your honour be melancholy sir nor despair things may go better as long as you are sure of my lady and that i am certain you may be for she never will be brought to consent to marry any other man
indeed i am terribly afeared the squire will do her a mischief in his passion for he is a prodigious passionate gentleman and i am afeared too the poor lady will be brought to break her heart for she is as tenderhearted as a chicken
it is pity methinks she had not a little of my courage
if i was in love with a young man and my father offered to lock me up i'd tear his eyes out but i'd come at him but then there's a great fortune in the case which it is in her father's power either to give her or not that to be sure may make some difference  whether jones gave strict attention to all the foregoing harangue or whether it was for want of any vacancy in the discourse i cannot determine but he never once attempted to answer nor did she once stop till partridge came running into the room and informed him that the great lady was upon the stairs
nothing could equal the dilemma to which jones was now reduced
honour knew nothing of any acquaintance that subsisted between him and lady bellaston and she was almost the last person in the world to whom he would have communicated it
in this hurry and distress he took as is common enough the worst course and instead of exposing her to the lady which would have been of little consequence he chose to expose the lady to her he therefore resolved to hide honour whom he had but just time to convey behind the bed and to draw the curtains
the hurry in which jones had been all day engaged on account of his poor landlady and her family the terrors occasioned by mrs honour and the confusion into which he was thrown by the sudden arrival of lady bellaston had altogether driven former thoughts out of his head so that it never once occurred to his memory to act the part of a sick man which indeed neither the gaiety of his dress nor the freshness of his countenance would have at all supported
he received her ladyship therefore rather agreeably to her desires than to her expectations with all the good humour he could muster in his countenance and without any real or affected appearance of the least disorder
lady bellaston no sooner entered the room than she squatted herself down on the bed so my dear jones said she you find nothing can detain me long from you
perhaps i ought to be angry with you that i have neither seen nor heard from you all day for i perceive your distemper would have suffered you to come abroad nay i suppose you have not sat in your chamber all day drest up like a fine lady to see company after a lyingin but however don't think i intend to scold you for i never will give you an excuse for the cold behaviour of a husband by putting on the illhumour of a wife  nay lady bellaston said jones i am sure your ladyship will not upbraid me with neglect of duty when i only waited for orders
who my dear creature hath reason to complain
who missed an appointment last night and left an unhappy man to expect and wish and sigh and languish  do not mention it my dear mr jones cried she
if you knew the occasion you would pity me
in short it is impossible to conceive what women of condition are obliged to suffer from the impertinence of fools in order to keep up the farce of the world
i am glad however all your languishing and wishing have done you no harm for you never looked better in your life
upon my faith
jones you might at this instant sit for the picture of adonis  there are certain words of provocation which men of honour hold can properly be answered only by a blow
among lovers possibly there may be some expressions which can be answered only by a kiss
now the compliment which lady bellaston now made jones seems to be of this kind especially as it was attended with a look in which the lady conveyed more soft ideas than it was possible to express with her tongue
jones was certainly at this instant in one of the most disagreeable and distressed situations imaginable for to carry on the comparison we made use of before though the provocation was given by the lady jones could not receive satisfaction nor so much as offer to ask it in the presence of a third person seconds in this kind of duels not being according to the law of arms
as this objection did not occur to lady bellaston who was ignorant of any other woman being there but herself she waited some time in great astonishment for an answer from jones who conscious of the ridiculous figure he made stood at a distance and not daring to give the proper answer gave none at all
nothing can be imagined more comic nor yet more tragical than this scene would have been if it had lasted much longer
the lady had already changed colour two or three times had got up from the bed and sat down again while jones was wishing the ground to sink under him or the house to fall on his head when an odd accident freed him from an embarrassment out of which neither the eloquence of a cicero nor the politics of a machiavel could have delivered him without utter disgrace
this was no other than the arrival of young nightingale dead drunk or rather in that state of drunkenness which deprives men of the use of their reason without depriving them of the use of their limbs
mrs miller and her daughters were in bed and partridge was smoaking his pipe by the kitchen fire so that he arrived at mr jones's chamberdoor without any interruption
this he burst open and was entering without any ceremony when jones started from his seat and ran to oppose him which he did so effectually that nightingale never came far enough within the door to see who was sitting on the bed
nightingale had in reality mistaken jones's apartment for that in which himself had lodged he therefore strongly insisted on coming in often swearing that he would not be kept from his own bed
jones however prevailed over him and delivered him into the hands of partridge whom the noise on the stairs soon summoned to his master's assistance
and now jones was unwillingly obliged to return to his own apartment where at the very instant of his entrance he heard lady bellaston venting an exclamation though not a very loud one and at the same time saw her flinging herself into a chair in a vast agitation which in a lady of a tender constitution would have been an hysteric fit
in reality the lady frightened with the struggle between the two men of which she did not know what would be the issue as she heard nightingale swear many oaths he would come to his own bed attempted to retire to her known place of hiding which to her great confusion she found already occupied by another
is this usage to be borne mr jones cries the ladybasest of menwhat wretch is this to whom you have exposed me wretch  cries honour bursting in a violent rage from her place of concealmentmarry come upwretch forsoothas poor a wretch as i am i am honest this is more than some folks who are richer can say  jones instead of applying himself directly to take off the edge of mrs honour's resentment as a more experienced gallant would have done fell to cursing his stars and lamenting himself as the most unfortunate man in the world and presently after addressing himself to lady bellaston he fell to some very absurd protestations of innocence
by this time the lady having recovered the use of her reason which she had as ready as any woman in the world especially on such occasions calmly replied sir you need make no apologies i see now who the person is i did not at first know mrs honour but now i do i can suspect nothing wrong between her and you and i am sure she is a woman of too good sense to put any wrong constructions upon my visit to you i have been always her friend and it may be in my power to be much more hereafter  mrs honour was altogether as placable as she was passionate
hearing therefore lady bellaston assume the soft tone she likewise softened hersi'm sure madam says she i have been always ready to acknowledge your ladyship's friendships to me sure i never had so good a friend as your ladyshipand to be sure now i see it is your ladyship that i spoke to i could almost bite my tongue off for very madi constructions upon your ladyshipto be sure it doth not become a servant as i am to think about such a great ladyi mean i was a servant for indeed i am nobody's servant now the more miserable wretch is mei have lost the best mistress here honour thought fit to produce a shower of tearsdon't cry child  says the good lady ways perhaps may be found to make you amends
come to me tomorrow morning she then took up her fan which lay on the ground and without even looking at jones walked very majestically out of the room there being a kind of dignity in the impudence of women of quality which their inferiors vainly aspire to attain to in circumstances of this nature
jones followed her downstairs often offering her his hand which she absolutely refused him and got into her chair without taking any notice of him as he stood bowing before her
at his return upstairs a long dialogue past between him and mrs honour while she was adjusting herself after the discomposure she had undergone
the subject of this was his infidelity to her young lady on which she enlarged with great bitterness but jones at last found means to reconcile her and not only so but to obtain a promise of most inviolable secrecy and that she would the next morning endeavour to find out sophia and bring him a further account of the proceedings of the squire
thus ended this unfortunate adventure to the satisfaction only of mrs honour for a secret as some of my readers will perhaps acknowledge from experience is often a very valuable possession and that not only to those who faithfully keep it but sometimes to such as whisper it about till it come to the ears of every one except the ignorant person who pays for the supposed concealing of what is publickly known
chapter viii
short and sweet
notwithstanding all the obligations she had received from jones mrs miller could not forbear in the morning some gentle remonstrances for the hurricane which had happened the preceding night in his chamber
these were however so gentle and so friendly professing and indeed truly to aim at nothing more than the real good of mr jones himself that he far from being offended thankfully received the admonition of the good woman expressed much concern for what had past excused it as well as he could and promised never more to bring the same disturbances into the house
but though mrs miller did not refrain from a short expostulation in private at their first meeting yet the occasion of his being summoned downstairs that morning was of a much more agreeable kind being indeed to perform the office of a father to miss nancy and to give her in wedlock to mr nightingale who was now ready drest and full as sober as many of my readers will think a man ought to be who receives a wife in so imprudent a manner
and here perhaps it may be proper to account for the escape which this young gentleman had made from his uncle and for his appearance in the condition in which we have seen him the night before
now when the uncle had arrived at his lodgings with his nephew partly to indulge his own inclinations for he dearly loved his bottle and partly to disqualify his nephew from the immediate execution of his purpose he ordered wine to be set on the table with which he so briskly plyed the young gentleman that this latter who though not much used to drinking did not detest it so as to be guilty of disobedience or want of complacence by refusing was soon completely finished
just as the uncle had obtained this victory and was preparing a bed for his nephew a messenger arrived with a piece of news which so entirely disconcerted and shocked him that he in a moment lost all consideration for his nephew and his whole mind became entirely taken up with his own concerns
this sudden and afflicting news was no less than that his daughter had taken the opportunity of almost the first moment of his absence and had gone off with a neighbouring young clergyman against whom though her father could have had but one objection namely that he was worth nothing yet she had never thought proper to communicate her amour even to that father and so artfully had she managed that it had never been once suspected by any till now that it was consummated
old mr nightingale no sooner received this account than in the utmost confusion he ordered a postchaise to be instantly got ready and having recommended his nephew to the care of a servant he directly left the house scarce knowing what he did nor whither he went
the uncle thus departed when the servant came to attend the nephew to bed had waked him for that purpose and had at last made him sensible that his uncle was gone he instead of accepting the kind offices tendered him insisted on a chair being called with this the servant who had received no strict orders to the contrary readily complied and thus being conducted back to the house of mrs miller he had staggered up to mr jones's chamber as hath been before recounted
this bar of the uncle being now removed though young nightingale knew not as yet in what manner and all parties being quickly ready the mother mr jones mr nightingale and his love stept into a hackneycoach which conveyed them to doctors' commons where miss nancy was in vulgar language soon made an honest woman and the poor mother became in the purest sense of the word one of the happiest of all human beings
and now mr jones having seen his good offices to that poor woman and her family brought to a happy conclusion began to apply himself to his own concerns but here lest many of my readers should censure his folly for thus troubling himself with the affairs of others and lest some few should think he acted more disinterestedly than indeed he did we think proper to assure our reader that he was so far from being unconcerned in this matter that he had indeed a very considerable interest in bringing it to that final consummation
to explain this seeming paradox at once he was one who could truly say with him in terence homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto
he was never an indifferent spectator of the misery or happiness of any one and he felt either the one or the other in great proportion as he himself contributed to either
he could not therefore be the instrument of raising a whole family from the lowest state of wretchedness to the highest pitch of joy without conveying great felicity to himself more perhaps than worldly men often purchase to themselves by undergoing the most severe labour and often by wading through the deepest iniquity
those readers who are of the same complexion with him will perhaps think this short chapter contains abundance of matter while others may probably wish short as it is that it had been totally spared as impertinent to the main design which i suppose they conclude is to bring mr jones to the gallows or if possible to a more deplorable catastrophe
chapter ix
containing loveletters of several sorts
mr jones at his return home found the following letters lying on his table which he luckily opened in the order they were sent
letter i
surely i am under some strange infatuation i cannot keep my   resolutions a moment however strongly made or justly founded
last   night i resolved never to see you more this morning i am willing to   hear if you can as you say clear up this affair
and yet i know   that to be impossible
i have said everything to myself which you   can inventperhaps not
perhaps your invention is stronger
come   to me therefore the moment you receive this
if you can forge an   excuse i almost promise you to believe it
betrayed tooi will   think no morecome to me directlythis is the third letter i   have writ the two former are burnti am almost inclined to burn   this tooi wish i may preserve my sensescome to me   presently                                letter ii
if you ever expect to be forgiven or even suffered within my   doors come to me this instant                               letter iii
i now find you was not at home when my notes came to your lodgings
the moment you receive this let me see youi shall not stir out   nor shall anybody be let in but yourself
sure nothing can detain   you long  jones had just read over these three billets when mr nightingale came into the room
well tom said he any news from lady bellaston after last night's adventure for it was now no secret to any one in that house who the lady was
the lady bellaston answered jones very gravelynay dear tom cries nightingale don't be so reserved to your friends
though i was too drunk to see her last night i saw her at the masquerade
do you think i am ignorant who the queen of the fairies is and did you really then know the lady at the masquerade said jones
yes upon my soul did i said nightingale and have given you twenty hints of it since though you seemed always so tender on that point that i would not speak plainly
i fancy my friend by your extreme nicety in this matter you are not so well acquainted with the character of the lady as with her person
don't be angry tom but upon my honour you are not the first young fellow she hath debauched
her reputation is in no danger believe me  though jones had no reason to imagine the lady to have been of the vestal kind when his amour began yet as he was thoroughly ignorant of the town and had very little acquaintance in it he had no knowledge of that character which is vulgarly called a demirep that is to say a woman who intrigues with every man she likes under the name and appearance of virtue and who though some overnice ladies will not be seen with her is visited as they term it by the whole town in short whom everybody knows to be what nobody calls her
when he found therefore that nightingale was perfectly acquainted with his intrigue and began to suspect that so scrupulous a delicacy as he had hitherto observed was not quite necessary on the occasion he gave a latitude to his friend's tongue and desired him to speak plainly what he knew or had ever heard of the lady
nightingale who in many other instances was rather too effeminate in his disposition had a pretty strong inclination to tittletattle
he had no sooner therefore received a full liberty of speaking from jones than he entered upon a long narrative concerning the lady which as it contained many particulars highly to her dishonour we have too great a tenderness for all women of condition to repeat
we would cautiously avoid giving an opportunity to the future commentators on our works of making any malicious application and of forcing us to be against our will the author of scandal which never entered into our head
jones having very attentively heard all that nightingale had to say fetched a deep sigh which the other observing cried heyday
why thou art not in love i hope
had i imagined my stories would have affected you i promise you should never have heard them o my dear friend cries jones i am so entangled with this woman that i know not how to extricate myself
in love indeed
no my friend but i am under obligations to her and very great ones
since you know so much i will be very explicit with you
it is owing perhaps solely to her that i have not before this wanted a bit of bread
how can i possibly desert such a woman
and yet i must desert her or be guilty of the blackest treachery to one who deserves infinitely better of me than she can a woman my nightingale for whom i have a passion which few can have an idea of
i am half distracted with doubts how to act  and is this other pray an honourable mistress cries nightingale
honourable answered jones no breath ever yet durst sully her reputation
the sweetest air is not purer the limpid stream not clearer than her honour
she is all over both in mind and body consummate perfection
she is the most beautiful creature in the universe and yet she is mistress of such noble elevated qualities that though she is never from my thoughts i scarce ever think of her beauty but when i see itand can you my good friend cries nightingale with such an engagement as this upon your hands hesitate a moment about quitting such a hold said jones no more abuse of her i detest the thought of ingratitude pooh  answered the other you are not the first upon whom she hath conferred obligations of this kind
she is remarkably liberal where she likes though let me tell you her favours are so prudently bestowed that they should rather raise a man's vanity than his gratitude in short nightingale proceeded so far on this head and told his friend so many stories of the lady which he swore to the truth of that he entirely removed all esteem for her from the breast of jones and his gratitude was lessened in proportion
indeed he began to look on all the favours he had received rather as wages than benefits which depreciated not only her but himself too in his own conceit and put him quite out of humour with both
from this disgust his mind by a natural transition turned towards sophia her virtue her purity her love to him her sufferings on his account filled all his thoughts and made his commerce with lady bellaston appear still more odious
the result of all was that though his turning himself out of her service in which light he now saw his affair with her would be the loss of his bread yet he determined to quit her if he could but find a handsome pretence which being communicated to his friend nightingale considered a little and then said i have it my boy
i have found out a sure method propose marriage to her and i would venture hanging upon the success marriage cries jones
ay propose marriage answered nightingale and she will declare off in a moment
i knew a young fellow whom she kept formerly who made the offer to her in earnest and was presently turned off for his pains  jones declared he could not venture the experiment
perhaps said he she may be less shocked at this proposal from one man than from another
and if she should take me at my word where am i then
caught in my own trap and undone for ever no answered nightingale not if i can give you an expedient by which you may at any time get out of the trapwhat expedient can that be  replied jones
this answered nightingale
the young fellow i mentioned who is one of the most intimate acquaintances i have in the world is so angry with her for some ill offices she hath since done him that i am sure he would without any difficulty give you a sight of her letters upon which you may decently break with her and declare off before the knot is tyed if she should really be willing to tie it which i am convinced she will not  after some hesitation jones upon the strength of this assurance consented but as he swore he wanted the confidence to propose the matter to her face he wrote the following letter which nightingale dictated    madam    i am extremely concerned that by an unfortunate engagement   abroad i should have missed receiving the honour of your ladyship's   commands the moment they came and the delay which i must now suffer   of vindicating myself to your ladyship greatly adds to this   misfortune
o lady bellaston
what a terror have i been in for fear   your reputation should be exposed by these perverse accidents
there   is one only way to secure it
i need not name what that is
only   permit me to say that as your honour is as dear to me as my own so   my sole ambition is to have the glory of laying my liberty at your   feet and believe me when i assure you i can never be made   completely happy without you generously bestow on me a legal right   of calling you mine for everi am        madam          with most profound respect               your ladyship's most obliged                    obedient humble servant                                       thomas jones  to this she presently returned the following answer    sir    when i read over your serious epistle i could from its coldness   and formality have sworn that you already had the legal right you   mention nay that we had for many years composed that monstrous   animal a husband and wife
do you really then imagine me a fool
or   do you fancy yourself capable of so entirely persuading me out of my   senses that i should deliver my whole fortune into your power in   order to enable you to support your pleasures at my expense
are   these the proofs of love which i expected
is this the return for
but i scorn to upbraid you and am in great admiration of your   profound respect
ps
i am prevented from revisingperhaps i have said more than   i meantcome to me at eight this evening  jones by the advice of his privycouncil replied    madam    it is impossible to express how much i am shocked at the suspicion   you entertain of me
can lady bellaston have conferred favours on a   man whom she could believe capable of so base a design
or can she   treat the most solemn tie of love with contempt
can you imagine   madam that if the violence of my passion in an unguarded moment   overcame the tenderness which i have for your honour i would think   of indulging myself in the continuance of an intercourse which could   not possibly escape long the notice of the world and which when   discovered must prove so fatal to your reputation
if such be your   opinion of me i must pray for a sudden opportunity of returning   those pecuniary obligations which i have been so unfortunate to   receive at your hands and for those of a more tender kind i shall   ever remain c and so concluded in the very words with which he   had concluded the former letter
the lady answered as follows    i see you are a villain
and i despise you from my soul
if you   come here i shall not be at home  though jones was well satisfied with his deliverance from a thraldom which those who have ever experienced it will i apprehend allow to be none of the lightest he was not however perfectly easy in his mind
there was in this scheme too much of fallacy to satisfy one who utterly detested every species of falshood or dishonesty nor would he indeed have submitted to put it in practice had he not been involved in a distressful situation where he was obliged to be guilty of some dishonour either to the one lady or the other and surely the reader will allow that every good principle as well as love pleaded strongly in favour of sophia
nightingale highly exulted in the success of his stratagem upon which he received many thanks and much applause from his friend
he answered dear tom we have conferred very different obligations on each other
to me you owe the regaining your liberty to you i owe the loss of mine
but if you are as happy in the one instance as i am in the other i promise you we are the two happiest fellows in england  the two gentlemen were now summoned down to dinner where mrs miller who performed herself the office of cook had exerted her best talents to celebrate the wedding of her daughter
this joyful circumstance she ascribed principally to the friendly behaviour of jones her whole soul was fired with gratitude towards him and all her looks words and actions were so busied in expressing it that her daughter and even her new soninlaw were very little objects of her consideration
dinner was just ended when mrs miller received a letter but as we have had letters enow in this chapter we shall communicate its contents in our next
chapter x
consisting partly of facts and partly of observations upon them
the letter then which arrived at the end of the preceding chapter was from mr allworthy and the purport of it was his intention to come immediately to town with his nephew blifil and a desire to be accommodated with his usual lodgings which were the first floor for himself and the second for his nephew
the chearfulness which had before displayed itself in the countenance of the poor woman was a little clouded on this occasion
this news did indeed a good deal disconcert her
to requite so disinterested a match with her daughter by presently turning her new soninlaw out of doors appeared to her very unjustifiable on the one hand and on the other she could scarce bear the thoughts of making any excuse to mr allworthy after all the obligations received from him for depriving him of lodgings which were indeed strictly his due for that gentleman in conferring all his numberless benefits on others acted by a rule diametrically opposite to what is practised by most generous people
he contrived on all occasions to hide his beneficence not only from the world but even from the object of it
he constantly used the words lend and pay instead of give and by every other method he could invent always lessened with his tongue the favours he conferred while he was heaping them with both his hands
when he settled the annuity of  a year therefore on mrs miller he told her it was in consideration of always having her firstfloor when he was in town which he scarce ever intended to be but that she might let it at any other time for that he would always send her a month's warning he was now however hurried to town so suddenly that he had no opportunity of giving such notice and this hurry probably prevented him when he wrote for his lodgings adding if they were then empty for he would most certainly have been well satisfied to have relinquished them on a less sufficient excuse than what mrs miller could now have made
but there are a sort of persons who as prior excellently well remarks direct their conduct by something        beyond the fix'd and settled rules       of vice and virtue in the schools       beyond the letter of the law
to these it is so far from being sufficient that their defence would acquit them at the old bailey that they are not even contented though conscience the severest of all judges should discharge them
nothing short of the fair and honourable will satisfy the delicacy of their minds and if any of their actions fall short of this mark they mope and pine are as uneasy and restless as a murderer who is afraid of a ghost or of the hangman
mrs miller was one of these
she could not conceal her uneasiness at this letter with the contents of which she had no sooner acquainted the company and given some hints of her distress than jones her good angel presently relieved her anxiety
as for myself madam  said he my lodging is at your service at a moment's warning and mr nightingale i am sure as he cannot yet prepare a house fit to receive his lady will consent to return to his new lodging whither mrs nightingale will certainly consent to go with which proposal both husband and wife instantly agreed
the reader will easily believe that the cheeks of mrs miller began again to glow with additional gratitude to jones but perhaps it may be more difficult to persuade him that mr jones having in his last speech called her daughter mrs nightingale it being the first time that agreeable sound had ever reached her ears gave the fond mother more satisfaction and warmed her heart more towards jones than his having dissipated her present anxiety
the next day was then appointed for the removal of the newmarried couple and of mr jones who was likewise to be provided for in the same house with his friend
and now the serenity of the company was again restored and they past the day in the utmost chearfulness all except jones who though he outwardly accompanied the rest in their mirth felt many a bitter pang on the account of his sophia which were not a little heightened by the news of mr blifil's coming to town for he clearly saw the intention of his journey and what greatly aggravated his concern was that mrs honour who had promised to inquire after sophia and to make her report to him early the next evening had disappointed him
in the situation that he and his mistress were in at this time there were scarce any grounds for him to hope that he should hear any good news yet he was as impatient to see mrs honour as if he had expected she would bring him a letter with an assignation in it from sophia and bore the disappointment as ill
whether this impatience arose from that natural weakness of the human mind which makes it desirous to know the worst and renders uncertainty the most intolerable of pains or whether he still flattered himself with some secret hopes we will not determine
but that it might be the last whoever has loved cannot but know
for of all the powers exercised by this passion over our minds one of the most wonderful is that of supporting hope in the midst of despair
difficulties improbabilities nay impossibilities are quite overlooked by it so that to any man extremely in love may be applied what addison says of caesar        the alps and pyrenaeans sink before him  yet it is equally true that the same passion will sometimes make mountains of molehills and produce despair in the midst of hope but these cold fits last not long in good constitutions
which temper jones was now in we leave the reader to guess having no exact information about it but this is certain that he had spent two hours in expectation when being unable any longer to conceal his uneasiness he retired to his room where his anxiety had almost made him frantick when the following letter was brought him from mrs honour with which we shall present the reader verbatim et literatim    sir    i shud sartenly haf kaled on you a cordin too mi prommiss haddunt   itt bin that hur lashipp prevent mee for to bee sur sir you nose   very well that evere persun must luk furst at ome and sartenly such   anuther offar mite not have ever hapned so as i shud ave bin justly   to blam had i not excepted of it when her lashipp was so veri kind   as to offar to mak mee hur one uman without mi ever askin any such   thing to be sur shee is won of thee best ladis in thee wurld and   pepil who sase to the kontrari must bee veri wiket pepil in thare   harts

while jones was terrifying himself with the apprehension of a thousand dreadful machinations and deep political designs which he imagined to be at the bottom of the promotion of honour fortune who hitherto seems to have been an utter enemy to his match with sophia tried a new method to put a final end to it by throwing a temptation in his way which in his present desperate situation it seemed unlikely he should be able to resist
chapter xi
containing curious but not unprecedented matter
there was a lady one mrs hunt who had often seen jones at the house where he lodged being intimately acquainted with the women there and indeed a very great friend to mrs miller
her age was about thirty for she owned sixandtwenty her face and person very good only inclining a little too much to be fat
she had been married young by her relations to an old turkey merchant who having got a great fortune had left off trade
with him she lived without reproach but not without pain in a state of great selfdenial for about twelve years and her virtue was rewarded by his dying and leaving her very rich
the first year of her widowhood was just at an end and she had past it in a good deal of retirement seeing only a few particular friends and dividing her time between her devotions and novels of which she was always extremely fond
very good health a very warm constitution and a good deal of religion made it absolutely necessary for her to marry again and she resolved to please herself in her second husband as she had done her friends in the first
from her the following billet was brought to jones    sir    from the first day i saw you i doubt my eyes have told you too   plainly that you were not indifferent to me but neither my tongue   nor my hand should have ever avowed it had not the ladies of the   family where you are lodged given me such a character of you and   told me such proofs of your virtue and goodness as convince me you   are not only the most agreeable but the most worthy of men
i have   also the satisfaction to hear from them that neither my person   understanding or character are disagreeable to you
i have a   fortune sufficient to make us both happy but which cannot make me   so without you
in thus disposing of myself i know i shall incur   the censure of the world but if i did not love you more than i fear   the world i should not be worthy of you
one only difficulty stops   me i am informed you are engaged in a commerce of gallantry with a   woman of fashion
if you think it worth while to sacrifice that to   the possession of me i am yours if not forget my weakness and   let this remain an eternal secret between you and                                     arabella hunt  at the reading of this jones was put into a violent flutter
his fortune was then at a very low ebb the source being stopt from which hitherto he had been supplied
of all he had received from lady bellaston not above five guineas remained and that very morning he had been dunned by a tradesman for twice that sum
his honourable mistress was in the hands of her father and he had scarce any hopes ever to get her out of them again
to be subsisted at her expense from that little fortune she had independent of her father went much against the delicacy both of his pride and his love
this lady's fortune would have been exceeding convenient to him and he could have no objection to her in any respect
on the contrary he liked her as well as he did any woman except sophia
but to abandon sophia and marry another that was impossible he could not think of it upon any account yet why should he not since it was plain she could not be his
would it not be kinder to her than to continue her longer engaged in a hopeless passion for him
ought he not to do so in friendship to her
this notion prevailed some moments and he had almost determined to be false to her from a high point of honour but that refinement was not able to stand very long against the voice of nature which cried in his heart that such friendship was treason to love
at last he called for pen ink and paper and writ as follows to mrs hunt    madam    it would be but a poor return to the favour you have done me to   sacrifice any gallantry to the possession of you and i would   certainly do it though i were not disengaged as at present i am   from any affair of that kind
but i should not be the honest man you   think me if i did not tell you that my affections are engaged to   another who is a woman of virtue and one that i never can leave   though it is probable i shall never possess her
god forbid that in   return of your kindness to me i should do you such an injury as to   give you my hand when i cannot give my heart
no i had much rather   starve than be guilty of that
even though my mistress were married   to another i would not marry you unless my heart had entirely   effaced all impressions of her
be assured that your secret was not   more safe in your own breast than in that of your most obliged and   grateful humble servant                                        t
jones  when our heroe had finished and sent this letter he went to his scrutore took out miss western's muff kissed it several times and then strutted some turns about his room with more satisfaction of mind than ever any irishman felt in carrying off a fortune of fifty thousand pounds
chapter xii
a discovery made by partridge
while jones was exulting in the consciousness of his integrity partridge came capering into the room as was his custom when he brought or fancied he brought any good tidings
he had been despatched that morning by his master with orders to endeavour by the servants of lady bellaston or by any other means to discover whither sophia had been conveyed and he now returned and with a joyful countenance told our heroe that he had found the lost bird
i have seen sir says he black george the gamekeeper who is one of the servants whom the squire hath brought with him to town
i knew him presently though i have not seen him these several years but you know sir he is a very remarkable man or to use a purer phrase he hath a most remarkable beard the largest and blackest i ever saw
it was some time however before black george could recollect me  well but what is your good news cries jones what do you know of my sophia you shall know presently sir answered partridge i am coming to it as fast as i can
you are so impatient sir you would come at the infinitive mood before you can get to the imperative
as i was saying sir it was some time before he recollected my faceconfound your face cries jones what of my sophia nay sir answered partridge i know nothing more of madam sophia than what i am going to tell you and i should have told you all before this if you had not interrupted me but if you look so angry at me you will frighten all of it out of my head or to use a purer phrase out of my memory
i never saw you look so angry since the day we left upton which i shall remember if i was to live a thousand yearswell pray go on your own way said jones you are resolved to make me mad i find not for the world answered partridge i have suffered enough for that already which as i said i shall bear in my remembrance the longest day i have to live well but black george cries jones
well sir as i was saying it was a long time before he could recollect me for indeed i am very much altered since i saw him
non sum qualis eram i have had troubles in the world and nothing alters a man so much as grief
i have heard it will change the colour of a man's hair in a night
however at last know me he did that's sure enough for we are both of an age and were at the same charity school
george was a great dunce but no matter for that all men do not thrive in the world according to their learning
i am sure i have reason to say so but it will be all one a thousand years hence
well sir where was iowell we no sooner knew each other than after many hearty shakes by the hand we agreed to go to an alehouse and take a pot and by good luck the beer was some of the best i have met with since i have been in town
now sir i am coming to the point for no sooner did i name you and told him that you and i came to town together and had lived together ever since than he called for another pot and swore he would drink to your health and indeed he drank your health so heartily that i was overjoyed to see there was so much gratitude left in the world and after we had emptied that pot i said i would buy my pot too and so we drank another to your health and then i made haste home to tell you the news  what news cries jones you have not mentioned a word of my sophia bless me
i had like to have forgot that
indeed we mentioned a great deal about young madam western and george told me all that mr blifil is coming to town in order to be married to her
he had best make haste then says i or somebody will have her before he comes and indeed says i mr seagrim it is a thousand pities somebody should not have her for he certainly loves her above all the women in the world
i would have both you and she know that it is not for her fortune he follows her for i can assure you as to matter of that there is another lady one of much greater quality and fortune than she can pretend to who is so fond of somebody that she comes after him day and night  here jones fell into a passion with partridge for having as he said betrayed him but the poor fellow answered he had mentioned no name besides sir said he i can assure you george is sincerely your friend and wished mr blifil at the devil more than once nay he said he would do anything in his power upon earth to serve you and so i am convinced he will
betray you indeed
why i question whether you have a better friend than george upon earth except myself or one that would go farther to serve you  well says jones a little pacified you say this fellow who i believe indeed is enough inclined to be my friend lives in the same house with sophia  in the same house answered partridge why sir he is one of the servants of the family and very well drest i promise you he is if it was not for his black beard you would hardly know him  one service then at least he may do me says jones sure he can certainly convey a letter to my sophia  you have hit the nail ad unguem cries partridge how came i not to think of it
i will engage he shall do it upon the very first mentioning  well then said jones do you leave me at present and i will write a letter which you shall deliver to him tomorrow morning for i suppose you know where to find him  o yes sir answered partridge i shall certainly find him again there is no fear of that
the liquor is too good for him to stay away long
i make no doubt but he will be there every day he stays in town  so you don't know the street then where my sophia is lodged cries jones
indeed sir i do says partridge
what is the name of the street cries jones
the name sir
why here sir just by answered partridge not above a street or two off
i don't indeed know the very name for as he never told me if i had asked you know it might have put some suspicion into his head
no no sir let me alone for that
i am too cunning for that i promise you  thou art most wonderfully cunning indeed replied jones however i will write to my charmer since i believe you will be cunning enough to find him tomorrow at the alehouse  and now having dismissed the sagacious partridge mr jones sat himself down to write in which employment we shall leave him for a time
and here we put an end to the fifteenth book
book xvi
containing the space of five days
chapter i
of prologues
i have heard of a dramatic writer who used to say he would rather write a play than a prologue in like manner i think i can with less pains write one of the books of this history than the prefatory chapter to each of them
to say the truth i believe many a hearty curse hath been devoted on the head of that author who first instituted the method of prefixing to his play that portion of matter which is called the prologue and which at first was part of the piece itself but of latter years hath had usually so little connexion with the drama before which it stands that the prologue to one play might as well serve for any other
those indeed of more modern date seem all to be written on the same three topics viz an abuse of the taste of the town a condemnation of all contemporary authors and an eulogium on the performance just about to be represented
the sentiments in all these are very little varied nor is it possible they should and indeed i have often wondered at the great invention of authors who have been capable of finding such various phrases to express the same thing
in like manner i apprehend some future historian if any one shall do me the honour of imitating my manner will after much scratching his pate bestow some good wishes on my memory for having first established these several initial chapters most of which like modern prologues may as properly be prefixed to any other book in this history as to that which they introduce or indeed to any other history as to this
but however authors may suffer by either of these inventions the reader will find sufficient emolument in the one as the spectator hath long found in the other
first it is well known that the prologue serves the critic for an opportunity to try his faculty of hissing and to tune his catcall to the best advantage by which means i have known those musical instruments so well prepared that they have been able to play in full concert at the first rising of the curtain
the same advantages may be drawn from these chapters in which the critic will be always sure of meeting with something that may serve as a whetstone to his noble spirit so that he may fall with a more hungry appetite for censure on the history itself
and here his sagacity must make it needless to observe how artfully these chapters are calculated for that excellent purpose for in these we have always taken care to intersperse somewhat of the sour or acid kind in order to sharpen and stimulate the said spirit of criticism
again the indolent reader as well as spectator finds great advantage from both these for as they are not obliged either to see the one or read the others and both the play and the book are thus protracted by the former they have a quarter of an hour longer allowed them to sit at dinner and by the latter they have the advantage of beginning to read at the fourth or fifth page instead of the first a matter by no means of trivial consequence to persons who read books with no other view than to say they have read them a more general motive to reading than is commonly imagined and from which not only law books and good books but the pages of homer and virgil of swift and cervantes have been often turned over
many other are the emoluments which arise from both these but they are for the most part so obvious that we shall not at present stay to enumerate them especially since it occurs to us that the principal merit of both the prologue and the preface is that they be short
chapter ii
a whimsical adventure which befel the squire with the distressed situation of sophia
we must now convey the reader to mr western's lodgings which were in piccadilly where he was placed by the recommendation of the landlord at the hercules pillars at hyde park corner for at the inn which was the first he saw on his arrival in town he placed his horses and in those lodgings which were the first he heard of he deposited himself
here when sophia alighted from the hackneycoach which brought her from the house of lady bellaston she desired to retire to the apartment provided for her to which her father very readily agreed and whither he attended her himself
a short dialogue neither very material nor pleasant to relate minutely then passed between them in which he pressed her vehemently to give her consent to the marriage with blifil who as he acquainted her was to be in town in a few days but instead of complying she gave a more peremptory and resolute refusal than she had ever done before
this so incensed her father that after many bitter vows that he would force her to have him whether she would or no he departed from her with many hard words and curses locked the door and put the key into his pocket
while sophia was left with no other company than what attend the closest state prisoner namely fire and candle the squire sat down to regale himself over a bottle of wine with his parson and the landlord of the hercules pillars who as the squire said would make an excellent third man and could inform them of the news of the town and how affairs went for to be sure says he he knows a great deal since the horses of many of the quality stand at his house
in this agreeable society mr western past that evening and great part of the succeeding day during which period nothing happened of sufficient consequence to find a place in this history
all this time sophia past by herself for her father swore she should never come out of her chamber alive unless she first consented to marry blifil nor did he ever suffer the door to be unlocked unless to convey her food on which occasions he always attended himself
the second morning after his arrival while he and the parson were at breakfast together on a toast and tankard he was informed that a gentleman was below to wait on him
a gentleman quoth the squire who the devil can he be
do doctor go down and see who 'tis
mr blifil can hardly be come to town yetgo down do and know what his business is  the doctor returned with an account that it was a very welldrest man and by the ribbon in his hat he took him for an officer of the army that he said he had some particular business which he could deliver to none but mr western himself
an officer cries the squire what can any such fellow have to do with me
if he wants an order for baggagewaggons i am no justice of peace here nor can i grant a warrantlet un come up then if he must speak to me  a very genteel man now entered the room who having made his compliments to the squire and desired the favour of being alone with him delivered himself as follows  sir i come to wait upon you by the command of my lord fellamar but with a very different message from what i suppose you expect after what past the other night  my lord who cries the squire i never heard the name o'un  his lordship said the gentleman is willing to impute everything to the effect of liquor and the most trifling acknowledgment of that kind will set everything right for as he hath the most violent attachment to your daughter you sir are the last person upon earth from whom he would resent an affront and happy is it for you both that he hath given such public demonstrations of his courage as to be able to put up an affair of this kind without danger of any imputation on his honour
all he desires therefore is that you will before me make some acknowledgment the slightest in the world will be sufficient and he intends this afternoon to pay his respects to you in order to obtain your leave of visiting the young lady on the footing of a lover  i don't understand much of what you say sir said the squire but i suppose by what you talk about my daughter that this is the lord which my cousin lady bellaston mentioned to me and said something about his courting my daughter
if so be that how that be the caseyou may give my service to his lordship and tell un the girl is disposed of already  perhaps sir said the gentleman you are not sufficiently apprized of the greatness of this offer
i believe such a person title and fortune would be nowhere refused  lookee sir answered the squire to be very plain my daughter is bespoke already but if she was not i would not marry her to a lord upon any account i hate all lords they are a parcel of courtiers and hanoverians and i will have nothing to do with them  well sir said the gentleman if that is your resolution the message i am to deliver to you is that my lord desires the favour of your company this morning in hyde park  you may tell my lord answered the squire that i am busy and cannot come
i have enough to look after at home and can't stir abroad on any account  i am sure sir quoth the other you are too much a gentleman to send such a message you will not i am convinced have it said of you that after having affronted a noble peer you refuse him satisfaction
his lordship would have been willing from his great regard to the young lady to have made up matters in another way but unless he is to look on you as a father his honour will not suffer his putting up such an indignity as you must be sensible you offered him  i offered him cries the squire it is a dn'd lie
i never offered him anything  upon these words the gentleman returned a very short verbal rebuke and this he accompanied at the same time with some manual remonstrances which no sooner reached the ears of mr western than that worthy squire began to caper very briskly about the room bellowing at the same time with all his might as if desirous to summon a greater number of spectators to behold his agility
the parson who had left great part of the tankard unfinished was not retired far he immediately attended therefore on the squire's vociferation crying bless me
sir what's the mattermatter  quoth the squire here's a highwayman i believe who wants to rob and murder mefor he hath fallen upon me with that stick there in his hand when i wish i may be dn'd if i gid un the least provocation  how sir said the captain did you not tell me i lyed  no as i hope to be saved answered the squire i believe i might say 'twas a lie that i had offered any affront to my lordbut i never said the word you lie'
i understand myself better and you might have understood yourself better than to fall upon a naked man
if i had a stick in my hand you would not have dared strike me
i'd have knocked thy lantern jaws about thy ears
come down into yard this minute and i'll take a bout with thee at single stick for a broken head that i will or i will go into naked room and box thee for a bellyfull
at unt half a man at unt i'm sure  the captain with some indignation replied i see sir you are below my notice and i shall inform his lordship you are below his
i am sorry i have dirtied my fingers with you at which words he withdrew the parson interposing to prevent the squire from stopping him in which he easily prevailed as the other though he made some efforts for the purpose did not seem very violently bent on success
however when the captain was departed the squire sent many curses and some menaces after him but as these did not set out from his lips till the officer was at the bottom of the stairs and grew louder and louder as he was more and more remote they did not reach his ears or at least did not retard his departure
poor sophia however who in her prison heard all her father's outcries from first to last began now first to thunder with her foot and afterwards to scream as loudly as the old gentleman himself had done before though in a much sweeter voice
these screams soon silenced the squire and turned all his consideration towards his daughter whom he loved so tenderly that the least apprehension of any harm happening to her threw him presently into agonies for except in that single instance in which the whole future happiness of her life was concerned she was sovereign mistress of his inclinations
having ended his rage against the captain with swearing he would take the law of him the squire now mounted upstairs to sophia whom as soon as he had unlocked and opened the door he found all pale and breathless
the moment however that she saw her father she collected all her spirits and catching him hold by the hand she cryed passionately o my dear sir i am almost frightened to death
i hope to heaven no harm hath happened to you no no cries the squire no great harm
the rascal hath not hurt me much but rat me if i don't ha the la o' un pray dear sir says she tell me what's the matter who is it that hath insulted you i don't know the name o' un answered western some officer fellow i suppose that we are to pay for beating us but i'll make him pay this bout if the rascal hath got anything which i suppose he hath not
for thof he was drest out so vine i question whether he had got a voot of land in the world but dear sir cries she what was the occasion of your quarrel what should it be sophy answered the squire but about you sophy
all my misfortunes are about you you will be the death of your poor father at last
here's a varlet of a lord the lord knows who forsooth
who hath a taan a liking to you and because i would not gi un my consent he sent me a kallenge
come do be a good girl sophy and put an end to all your father's troubles come do consent to ha un he will be in town within this day or two do but promise me to marry un as soon as he comes and you will make me the happiest man in the world and i will make you the happiest woman you shall have the finest cloaths in london and the finest jewels and a coach and six at your command
i promised allworthy already to give up half my estateod rabbet it
i should hardly stick at giving up the whole  will my papa be so kind says she as to hear me speakwhy wout ask sophy cries he when dost know i had rather hear thy voice than the musick of the best pack of dogs in englandhear thee my dear little girl
i hope i shall hear thee as long as i live for if i was ever to lose that pleasure i would not gee a brass varden to live a moment longer
indeed sophy you do not know how i love you indeed you don't or you never could have run away and left your poor father who hath no other joy no other comfort upon earth but his little sophy at these words the tears stood in his eyes and sophia with the tears streaming from hers answered indeed my dear papa i know you have loved me tenderly and heaven is my witness how sincerely i have returned your affection nor could anything but an apprehension of being forced into the arms of this man have driven me to run from a father whom i love so passionately that i would with pleasure sacrifice my life to his happiness nay i have endeavoured to reason myself into doing more and had almost worked up a resolution to endure the most miserable of all lives to comply with your inclination
it was that resolution alone to which i could not force my mind nor can i ever here the squire began to look wild and the foam appeared at his lips which sophia observing begged to be heard out and then proceeded if my father's life his health or any real happiness of his was at stake here stands your resolved daughter may heaven blast me if there is a misery i would not suffer to preserve youno that most detested most loathsome of all lots would i embrace
i would give my hand to blifil for your sakei tell thee it will preserve me answers the father it will give me health happiness life everythingupon my soul i shall die if dost refuse me i shall break my heart i shall upon my soulis it possible  says she you can have such a desire to make me miserablei tell thee noa answered he loudly dn me if there is a thing upon earth i would not do to see thee happyand will not my dear papa allow me to have the least knowledge of what will make me so
if it be true that happiness consists in opinion what must be my condition when i shall think myself the most miserable of all the wretches upon earth  better think yourself so said he than know it by being married to a poor bastardly vagabond if it will content you sir said sophia i will give you the most solemn promise never to marry him nor any other while my papa lives without his consent
let me dedicate my whole life to your service let me be again your poor sophy and my whole business and pleasure be as it hath been to please and divert you lookee sophy answered the squire i am not to be choused in this manner
your aunt western would then have reason to think me the fool she doth
no no sophy i'd have you to know i have a got more wisdom and know more of the world than to take the word of a woman in a matter where a man is concerned how sir have i deserved this want of confidence said she have i ever broke a single promise to you
or have i ever been found guilty of a falsehood from my cradle lookee sophy cries he that's neither here nor there
i am determined upon this match and have him you shall dn me if shat unt
dn me if shat unt though dost hang thyself the next morning at repeating which words he clinched his fist knit his brows bit his lips and thundered so loud that the poor afflicted terrified sophia sunk trembling into her chair and had not a flood of tears come immediately to her relief perhaps worse had followed
western beheld the deplorable condition of his daughter with no more contrition or remorse than the turnkey of newgate feels at viewing the agonies of a tender wife when taking her last farewel of her condemned husband or rather he looked down on her with the same emotions which arise in an honest fair tradesman who sees his debtor dragged to prison for  which though a just debt the wretch is wickedly unable to pay
or to hit the case still more nearly he felt the same compunction with a bawd when some poor innocent whom she hath ensnared into her hands falls into fits at the first proposal of what is called seeing company
indeed this resemblance would be exact was it not that the bawd hath an interest in what she doth and the father though perhaps he may blindly think otherwise can in reality have none in urging his daughter to almost an equal prostitution
in this condition he left his poor sophia and departing with a very vulgar observation on the effect of tears he locked the room and returned to the parson who said everything he durst in behalf of the young lady which though perhaps it was not quite so much as his duty required yet was it sufficient to throw the squire into a violent rage and into many indecent reflections on the whole body of the clergy which we have too great an honour for that sacred function to commit to paper
chapter iii
what happened to sophia during her confinement
the landlady of the house where the squire lodged had begun very early to entertain a strange opinion of her guests
however as she was informed that the squire was a man of vast fortune and as she had taken care to exact a very extraordinary price for her rooms she did not think proper to give any offence for though she was not without some concern for the confinement of poor sophia of whose great sweetness of temper and affability the maid of the house had made so favourable a report which was confirmed by all the squire's servants yet she had much more concern for her own interest than to provoke one whom as she said she perceived to be a very hastish kind of a gentleman
though sophia eat but little yet she was regularly served with her meals indeed i believe if she had liked any one rarity that the squire however angry would have spared neither pains nor cost to have procured it for her since however strange it may appear to some of my readers he really doated on his daughter and to give her any kind of pleasure was the highest satisfaction of his life
the dinnerhour being arrived black george carried her up a pullet the squire himself for he had sworn not to part with the key attending the door
as george deposited the dish some compliments passed between him and sophia for he had not seen her since she left the country and she treated every servant with more respect than some persons shew to those who are in a very slight degree their inferiors
sophia would have had him take the pullet back saying she could not eat but george begged her to try and particularly recommended to her the eggs of which he said it was full
all this time the squire was waiting at the door but george was a great favourite with his master as his employment was in concerns of the highest nature namely about the game and was accustomed to take many liberties
he had officiously carried up the dinner being as he said very desirous to see his young lady he made therefore no scruple of keeping his master standing above ten minutes while civilities were passing between him and sophia for which he received only a goodhumoured rebuke at the door when he returned
the eggs of pullets partridges pheasants c were as george well knew the most favourite dainties of sophia
it was therefore no wonder that he who was a very goodnatured fellow should take care to supply her with this kind of delicacy at a time when all the servants in the house were afraid she would be starved for she had scarce swallowed a single morsel in the last forty hours
though vexation hath not the same effect on all persons as it usually hath on a widow whose appetite it often renders sharper than it can be rendered by the air on bansted downs or salisbury plain yet the sublimest grief notwithstanding what some people may say to the contrary will eat at last
and sophia herself after some little consideration began to dissect the fowl which she found to be as full of eggs as george had reported it
but if she was pleased with these it contained something which would have delighted the royal society much more for if a fowl with three legs be so invaluable a curiosity when perhaps time hath produced a thousand such at what price shall we esteem a bird which so totally contradicts all the laws of animal oeconomy as to contain a letter in its belly
ovid tells us of a flower into which hyacinthus was metamorphosed that bears letters on its leaves which virgil recommended as a miracle to the royal society of his day but no age nor nation hath ever recorded a bird with a letter in its maw
but though a miracle of this kind might have engaged all the acadmies des sciences in europe and perhaps in a fruitless enquiry yet the reader by barely recollecting the last dialogue which passed between messieurs jones and partridge will be very easily satisfied from whence this letter came and how it found its passage into the fowl
sophia notwithstanding her long fast and notwithstanding her favourite dish was there before her no sooner saw the letter than she immediately snatched it up tore it open and read as follows    madam    was i not sensible to whom i have the honour of writing i should   endeavour however difficult to paint the horrors of my mind at the   account brought me by mrs honour but as tenderness alone can have   any true idea of the pangs which tenderness is capable of feeling   so can this most amiable quality which my sophia possesses in the   most eminent degree sufficiently inform her what her jones must   have suffered on this melancholy occasion
is there a circumstance   in the world which can heighten my agonies when i hear of any   misfortune which hath befallen you
surely there is one only and   with that i am accursed
it is my sophia the dreadful   consideration that i am myself the wretched cause
perhaps i here do   myself too much honour but none will envy me an honour which costs   me so extremely dear
pardon me this presumption and pardon me a   greater still if i ask you whether my advice my assistance my   presence my absence my death or my tortures can bring you any   relief
can the most perfect admiration the most watchful   observance the most ardent love the most melting tenderness the   most resigned submission to your will make you amends for what you   are to sacrifice to my happiness
if they can fly my lovely angel   to those arms which are ever open to receive and protect you and to   which whether you bring yourself alone or the riches of the world   with you is in my opinion an alternative not worth regarding
if   on the contrary wisdom shall predominate and on the most mature   reflection inform you that the sacrifice is too great and if   there be no way left to reconcile your father and restore the peace   of your dear mind but by abandoning me i conjure you drive me for   ever from your thoughts exert your resolution and let no   compassion for my sufferings bear the least weight in that tender   bosom
believe me madam i so sincerely love you better than   myself that my great and principal end is your happiness
my first   wish why would not fortune indulge me in it
was and pardon me if   i say still is to see you every moment the happiest of women my   second wish is to hear you are so but no misery on earth can equal   mine while i think you owe an uneasy moment to him who is           madam              in every sense and to every purpose                     your devoted                           thomas jones  what sophia said or did or thought upon this letter how often she read it or whether more than once shall all be left to our reader's imagination
the answer to it he may perhaps see hereafter but not at present for this reason among others that she did not now write any and that for several good causes one of which was this she had no paper pen nor ink
in the evening while sophia was meditating on the letter she had received or on something else a violent noise from below disturbed her meditations
this noise was no other than a round bout at altercation between two persons
one of the combatants by his voice she immediately distinguished to be her father but she did not so soon discover the shriller pipes to belong to the organ of her aunt western who was just arrived in town where having by means of one of her servants who stopt at the hercules pillars learned where her brother lodged she drove directly to his lodgings
we shall therefore take our leave at present of sophia and with our usual goodbreeding attend her ladyship
chapter iv
in which sophia is delivered from her confinement
the squire and the parson for the landlord was now otherwise engaged were smoaking their pipes together when the arrival of the lady was first signified
the squire no sooner heard her name than he immediately ran down to usher her upstairs for he was a great observer of such ceremonials especially to his sister of whom he stood more in awe than of any other human creature though he never would own this nor did he perhaps know it himself
mrs western on her arrival in the diningroom having flung herself into a chair began thus to harangue well surely no one ever had such an intolerable journey
i think the roads since so many turnpike acts are grown worse than ever
la brother how could you get into this odious place
no person of condition i dare swear ever set foot here before i don't know cries the squire i think they do well enough it was landlord recommended them
i thought as he knew most of the quality he could best shew me where to get among um well and where's my niece says the lady have you been to wait upon lady bellaston yet ay ay cries the squire your niece is safe enough she is upstairs in chamber how answered the lady is my niece in this house and does she not know of my being here no nobody can well get to her says the squire for she is under lock and key
i have her safe i vetched her from my lady cousin the first night i came to town and i have taken care o' her ever since she is as secure as a fox in a bag i promise you good heaven returned mrs western what do i hear
i thought what a fine piece of work would be the consequence of my consent to your coming to town yourself nay it was indeed your own headstrong will nor can i charge myself with having ever consented to it
did not you promise me brother that you would take none of these headstrong measures
was it not by these headstrong measures that you forced my niece to run away from you in the country
have you a mind to oblige her to take such another step zds and the devil cries the squire dashing his pipe on the ground did ever mortal hear the like
when i expected you would have commended me for all i have done to be fallen upon in this manner how brother said the lady have i ever given you the least reason to imagine i should commend you for locking up your daughter
have i not often told you that women in a free country are not to be treated with such arbitrary power
we are as free as the men and i heartily wish i could not say we deserve that freedom better
if you expect i should stay a moment longer in this wretched house or that i should ever own you again as my relation or that i should ever trouble myself again with the affairs of your family i insist upon it that my niece be set at liberty this instant this she spoke with so commanding an air standing with her back to the fire with one hand behind her and a pinch of snuff in the other that i question whether thalestris at the head of her amazons ever made a more tremendous figure
it is no wonder therefore that the poor squire was not proof against the awe which she inspired
there he cried throwing down the key there it is do whatever you please
i intended only to have kept her up till blifil came to town which can't be long and now if any harm happens in the mean time remember who is to be blamed for it  i will answer it with my life cried mrs western but i shall not intermeddle at all unless upon one condition and that is that you will commit the whole entirely to my care without taking any one measure yourself unless i shall eventually appoint you to act
if you ratify these preliminaries brother i yet will endeavour to preserve the honour of your family if not i shall continue in a neutral state  i pray you good sir said the parson permit yourself this once to be admonished by her ladyship peradventure by communing with young madam sophia she will effect more than you have been able to perpetrate by more rigorous measures  what dost thee open upon me cries the squire if thee dost begin to babble i shall whip thee in presently  fie brother answered the lady is this language to a clergyman
mr supple is a man of sense and gives you the best advice and the whole world i believe will concur in his opinion but i must tell you i expect an immediate answer to my categorical proposals
either cede your daughter to my disposal or take her wholly to your own surprizing discretion and then i here before mr supple evacuate the garrison and renounce you and your family for ever  i pray you let me be a mediator cries the parson let me supplicate you  why there lies the key on the table cries the squire
she may take un up if she pleases who hinders her  no brother answered the lady i insist on the formality of its being delivered me with a full ratification of all the concessions stipulated  why then i will deliver it to youthere 'tis cries the squire
i am sure sister you can't accuse me of ever denying to trust my daughter to you
she hath alived wi' you a whole year and muore to a time without my ever zeeing her  and it would have been happy for her answered the lady if she had always lived with me
nothing of this kind would have happened under my eye  ay certainly cries he i only am to blame  why you are to blame brother answered she
i have been often obliged to tell you so and shall always be obliged to tell you so
however i hope you will now amend and gather so much experience from past errors as not to defeat my wisest machinations by your blunders
indeed brother you are not qualified for these negociations
all your whole scheme of politics is wrong
i once more therefore insist that you do not intermeddle
remember only what is past  zds and bld sister cries the squire what would you have me say
you are enough to provoke the devil  there now said she just according to the old custom
i see brother there is no talking to you
i will appeal to mr supple who is a man of sense if i said anything which could put any human creature into a passion but you are so wrongheaded every way  let me beg you madam said the parson not to irritate his worship  irritate him said the lady sure you are as great a fool as himself
well brother since you have promised not to interfere i will once more undertake the management of my niece
lord have mercy upon all affairs which are under the directions of men
the head of one woman is worth a thousand of yours and now having summoned a servant to show her to sophia she departed bearing the key with her
she was no sooner gone than the squire having first shut the door ejaculated twenty bitches and as many hearty curses against her not sparing himself for having ever thought of her estate but added now one hath been a slave so long it would be pity to lose it at last for want of holding out a little longer
the bitch can't live for ever and i know i am down for it upon the will  the parson greatly commended this resolution and now the squire having ordered in another bottle which was his usual method when anything either pleased or vexed him did by drinking plentifully of this medicinal julap so totally wash away his choler that his temper was become perfectly placid and serene when mrs western returned with sophia into the room
the young lady had on her hat and capuchin and the aunt acquainted mr western that she intended to take her niece with her to her own lodgings for indeed brother says she these rooms are not fit to receive a christian soul in  very well madam quoth western whatever you please
the girl can never be in better hands than yours and the parson here can do me the justice to say that i have said fifty times behind your back that you was one of the most sensible women in the world  to this cries the parson i am ready to bear testimony  nay brother says mrs western i have always i'm sure given you as favourable a character
you must own you have a little too much hastiness in your temper but when you will allow yourself time to reflect i never knew a man more reasonable  why then sister if you think so said the squire here's your good health with all my heart
i am a little passionate sometimes but i scorn to bear any malice
sophy do you be a good girl and do everything your aunt orders you  i have not the least doubt of her answered mrs western
she hath had already an example before her eyes in the behaviour of that wretch her cousin harriet who ruined herself by neglecting my advice
o brother what think you
you was hardly gone out of hearing when you set out for london when who should arrive but that impudent fellow with the odious irish namethat fitzpatrick
he broke in abruptly upon me without notice or i would not have seen him
he ran on a long unintelligible story about his wife to which he forced me to give him a hearing but i made him very little answer and delivered him the letter from his wife which i bid him answer himself
i suppose the wretch will endeavour to find us out but i beg you will not see her for i am determined i will not  i zee her answered the squire you need not fear me
i'll ge no encouragement to such undutiful wenches
it is well for the fellow her husband i was not at huome
od rabbit it he should have taken a dance thru the horsepond i promise un
you zee sophy what undutifulness brings volks to
you have an example in your own family  brother cries the aunt you need not shock my niece by such odious repetitions
why will you not leave everything entirely to me well well i wull i wull said the squire
and now mrs western luckily for sophia put an end to the conversation by ordering chairs to be called
i say luckily for had it continued much longer fresh matter of dissension would most probably have arisen between the brother and sister between whom education and sex made the only difference for both were equally violent and equally positive they had both a vast affection for sophia and both a sovereign contempt for each other
chapter v  in which jones receives a letter from sophia and goes to a play with mrs miller and partridge
the arrival of black george in town and the good offices which that grateful fellow had promised to do for his old benefactor greatly comforted jones in the midst of all the anxiety and uneasiness which he had suffered on the account of sophia from whom by the means of the said george he received the following answer to his letter which sophia to whom the use of pen ink and paper was restored with her liberty wrote the very evening when she departed from her confinement    sir    as i do not doubt your sincerity in what you write you will be   pleased to hear that some of my afflictions are at an end by the   arrival of my aunt western with whom i am at present and with whom   i enjoy all the liberty i can desire
one promise my aunt hath   insisted on my making which is that i will not see or converse   with any person without her knowledge and consent
this promise i   have most solemnly given and shall most inviolably keep and though   she hath not expressly forbidden me writing yet that must be an   omission from forgetfulness or this perhaps is included in the   word conversing
however as i cannot but consider this as a breach   of her generous confidence in my honour you cannot expect that i   shall after this continue to write myself or to receive letters   without her knowledge
a promise is with me a very sacred thing and   to be extended to everything understood from it as well as to what   is expressed by it and this consideration may perhaps on   reflection afford you some comfort
but why should i mention a   comfort to you of this kind for though there is one thing in which   i can never comply with the best of fathers yet am i firmly   resolved never to act in defiance of him or to take any step of   consequence without his consent
a firm persuasion of this must   teach you to divert your thoughts from what fortune hath perhaps   made impossible
this your own interest persuades you
this may   reconcile i hope mr allworthy to you and if it will you have my   injunctions to pursue it
accidents have laid some obligations on   me and your good intentions probably more
fortune may perhaps be   some time kinder to us both than at present
believe this that i   shall always think of you as i think you deserve and am                           sir                     your obliged humble servant                                  sophia western
i charge you write to me no moreat present at least and accept   this which is now of no service to me which i know you must want   and think you owe the trifle only to that fortune by which you found   it     meaning perhaps the bankbill for 
a child who hath just learnt his letters would have spelt this letter out in less time than jones took in reading it
the sensations it occasioned were a mixture of joy and grief somewhat like what divide the mind of a good man when he peruses the will of his deceased friend in which a large legacy which his distresses make the more welcome is bequeathed to him
upon the whole however he was more pleased than displeased and indeed the reader may probably wonder that he was displeased at all but the reader is not quite so much in love as was poor jones and love is a disease which though it may in some instances resemble a consumption which it sometimes causes in others proceeds in direct opposition to it and particularly in this that it never flatters itself or sees any one symptom in a favourable light
one thing gave him complete satisfaction which was that his mistress had regained her liberty and was now with a lady where she might at least assure herself of a decent treatment
another comfortable circumstance was the reference which she made to her promise of never marrying any other man for however disinterested he might imagine his passion and notwithstanding all the generous overtures made in his letter i very much question whether he could have heard a more afflicting piece of news than that sophia was married to another though the match had been never so great and never so likely to end in making her completely happy
that refined degree of platonic affection which is absolutely detached from the flesh and is indeed entirely and purely spiritual is a gift confined to the female part of the creation many of whom i have heard declare and doubtless with great truth that they would with the utmost readiness resign a lover to a rival when such resignation was proved to be necessary for the temporal interest of such lover
hence therefore i conclude that this affection is in nature though i cannot pretend to say i have ever seen an instance of it
mr jones having spent three hours in reading and kissing the aforesaid letter and being at last in a state of good spirits from the lastmentioned considerations he agreed to carry an appointment which he had before made into execution
this was to attend mrs miller and her younger daughter into the gallery at the playhouse and to admit mr partridge as one of the company
for as jones had really that taste for humour which many affect he expected to enjoy much entertainment in the criticisms of partridge from whom he expected the simple dictates of nature unimproved indeed but likewise unadulterated by art
in the first row then of the first gallery did mr jones mrs miller her youngest daughter and partridge take their places
partridge immediately declared it was the finest place he had ever been in
when the first music was played he said it was a wonder how so many fiddlers could play at one time without putting one another out  while the fellow was lighting the upper candles he cried out to mrs miller look look madam the very picture of the man in the end of the commonprayer book before the gunpowdertreason service nor could he help observing with a sigh when all the candles were lighted that here were candles enough burnt in one night to keep an honest poor family for a whole twelvemonth  as soon as the play which was hamlet prince of denmark began partridge was all attention nor did he break silence till the entrance of the ghost upon which he asked jones what man that was in the strange dress something said he like what i have seen in a picture
sure it is not armour is it jones answered that is the ghost to which partridge replied with a smile persuade me to that sir if you can
though i can't say i ever actually saw a ghost in my life yet i am certain i should know one if i saw him better than that comes to
no no sir ghosts don't appear in such dresses as that neither in this mistake which caused much laughter in the neighbourhood of partridge he was suffered to continue till the scene between the ghost and hamlet when partridge gave that credit to mr garrick which he had denied to jones and fell into so violent a trembling that his knees knocked against each other
jones asked him what was the matter and whether he was afraid of the warrior upon the stage
o la
sir said he i perceive now it is what you told me
i am not afraid of anything for i know it is but a play
and if it was really a ghost it could do one no harm at such a distance and in so much company and yet if i was frightened i am not the only person  why who cries jones dost thou take to be such a coward here besides thyself nay you may call me coward if you will but if that little man there upon the stage is not frightened i never saw any man frightened in my life
ay ay go along with you ay to be sure
who's fool then
will you
lud have mercy upon such foolhardinesswhatever happens it is good enough for youfollow you
i'd follow the devil as soon
nay perhaps it is the devilfor they say he can put on what likeness he pleasesoh
here he is againno farther
no you have gone far enough already farther than i'd have gone for all the king's dominions jones offered to speak but partridge cried hush hush
dear sir don't you hear him and during the whole speech of the ghost he sat with his eyes fixed partly on the ghost and partly on hamlet and with his mouth open the same passions which succeeded each other in hamlet succeeding likewise in him
when the scene was over jones said why partridge you exceed my expectations
you enjoy the play more than i conceived possible  nay sir answered partridge if you are not afraid of the devil i can't help it but to be sure it is natural to be surprized at such things though i know there is nothing in them not that it was the ghost that surprized me neither for i should have known that to have been only a man in a strange dress but when i saw the little man so frightened himself it was that which took hold of me and dost thou imagine then partridge cries jones that he was really frightened nay sir said partridge did not you yourself observe afterwards when he found it was his own father's spirit and how he was murdered in the garden how his fear forsook him by degrees and he was struck dumb with sorrow as it were just as i should have been had it been my own casebut hush
o la
what noise is that
there he is againwell to be certain though i know there is nothing at all in it i am glad i am not down yonder where those men are then turning his eyes again upon hamlet ay you may draw your sword what signifies a sword against the power of the devil  during the second act partridge made very few remarks
he greatly admired the fineness of the dresses nor could he help observing upon the king's countenance
well said he how people may be deceived by faces
nulla fides fronti is i find a true saying
who would think by looking in the king's face that he had ever committed a murder he then enquired after the ghost but jones who intended he should be surprized gave him no other satisfaction than that he might possibly see him again soon and in a flash of fire  partridge sat in a fearful expectation of this and now when the ghost made his next appearance partridge cried out there sir now what say you now
is he frightened now or no
as much frightened as you think me and to be sure nobody can help some fears
i would not be in so bad a condition as what's his name squire hamlet is there for all the world
bless me
what's become of the spirit
as i am a living soul i thought i saw him sink into the earth indeed you saw right answered jones
well well cries partridge i know it is only a play and besides if there was anything in all this madam miller would not laugh so for as to you sir you would not be afraid i believe if the devil was here in personthere thereay no wonder you are in such a passion shake the vile wicked wretch to pieces
if she was my own mother i would serve her so
to be sure all duty to a mother is forfeited by such wicked doingsay go about your business i hate the sight of you  our critic was now pretty silent till the play which hamlet introduces before the king
this he did not at first understand till jones explained it to him but he no sooner entered into the spirit of it than he began to bless himself that he had never committed murder
then turning to mrs miller he asked her if she did not imagine the king looked as if he was touched though he is said he a good actor and doth all he can to hide it
well i would not have so much to answer for as that wicked man there hath to sit upon a much higher chair than he sits upon
no wonder he ran away for your sake i'll never trust an innocent face again  the gravedigging scene next engaged the attention of partridge who expressed much surprize at the number of skulls thrown upon the stage
to which jones answered that it was one of the most famous burialplaces about town no wonder then cries partridge that the place is haunted
but i never saw in my life a worse gravedigger
i had a sexton when i was clerk that should have dug three graves while he is digging one
the fellow handles a spade as if it was the first time he had ever had one in his hand
ay ay you may sing
you had rather sing than work i believeupon hamlet's taking up the skull he cried out well
it is strange to see how fearless some men are i never could bring myself to touch anything belonging to a dead man on any accounthe seemed frightened enough too at the ghost i thought
nemo omnibus horis sapit  little more worth remembering occurred during the play at the end of which jones asked him which of the players he had liked best to this he answered with some appearance of indignation at the question the king without doubt indeed mr partridge says mrs miller you are not of the same opinion with the town for they are all agreed that hamlet is acted by the best player who ever was on the stage he the best player cries partridge with a contemptuous sneer why i could act as well as he myself
i am sure if i had seen a ghost i should have looked in the very same manner and done just as he did
and then to be sure in that scene as you called it between him and his mother where you told me he acted so fine why lord help me any man that is any good man that had such a mother would have done exactly the same
i know you are only joking with me but indeed madam though i was never at a play in london yet i have seen acting before in the country and the king for my money he speaks all his words distinctly half as loud again as the otheranybody may see he is an actor  while mrs miller was thus engaged in conversation with partridge a lady came up to mr jones whom he immediately knew to be mrs fitzpatrick
she said she had seen him from the other part of the gallery and had taken that opportunity of speaking to him as she had something to say which might be of great service to himself
she then acquainted him with her lodgings and made him an appointment the next day in the morning which upon recollection she presently changed to the afternoon at which time jones promised to attend her
thus ended the adventure at the playhouse where partridge had afforded great mirth not only to jones and mrs miller but to all who sat within hearing who were more attentive to what he said than to anything that passed on the stage
he durst not go to bed all that night for fear of the ghost and for many nights after sweated two or three hours before he went to sleep with the same apprehensions and waked several times in great horrors crying out lord have mercy upon us
there it is    chapter vi
in which the history is obliged to look back
it is almost impossible for the best parent to observe an exact impartiality to his children even though no superior merit should bias his affection but sure a parent can hardly be blamed when that superiority determines his preference
as i regard all the personages of this history in the light of my children so i must confess the same inclination of partiality to sophia and for that i hope the reader will allow me the same excuse from the superiority of her character
this extraordinary tenderness which i have for my heroine never suffers me to quit her any long time without the utmost reluctance
i could now therefore return impatiently to enquire what hath happened to this lovely creature since her departure from her father's but that i am obliged first to pay a short visit to mr blifil
mr western in the first confusion into which his mind was cast upon the sudden news he received of his daughter and in the first hurry to go after her had not once thought of sending any account of the discovery to blifil
he had not gone far however before he recollected himself and accordingly stopt at the very first inn he came to and dispatched away a messenger to acquaint blifil with his having found sophia and with his firm resolution to marry her to him immediately if he would come up after him to town
as the love which blifil had for sophia was of that violent kind which nothing but the loss of her fortune or some such accident could lessen his inclination to the match was not at all altered by her having run away though he was obliged to lay this to his own account
he very readily therefore embraced this offer
indeed he now proposed the gratification of a very strong passion besides avarice by marrying this young lady and this was hatred for he concluded that matrimony afforded an equal opportunity of satisfying either hatred or love and this opinion is very probably verified by much experience
to say the truth if we are to judge by the ordinary behaviour of married persons to each other we shall perhaps be apt to conclude that the generality seek the indulgence of the former passion only in their union of everything but of hearts
there was one difficulty however in his way and this arose from mr allworthy
that good man when he found by the departure of sophia for neither that nor the cause of it could be concealed from him the great aversion which she had for his nephew began to be seriously concerned that he had been deceived into carrying matters so far
he by no means concurred with the opinion of those parents who think it as immaterial to consult the inclinations of their children in the affair of marriage as to solicit the good pleasure of their servants when they intend to take a journey and who are by law or decency at least withheld often from using absolute force
on the contrary as he esteemed the institution to be of the most sacred kind he thought every preparatory caution necessary to preserve it holy and inviolate and very wisely concluded that the surest way to effect this was by laying the foundation in previous affection
blifil indeed soon cured his uncle of all anger on the score of deceit by many vows and protestations that he had been deceived himself with which the many declarations of western very well tallied but now to persuade allworthy to consent to the renewing his addresses was a matter of such apparent difficulty that the very appearance was sufficient to have deterred a less enterprizing genius but this young gentleman so well knew his own talents that nothing within the province of cunning seemed to him hard to be achieved
here then he represented the violence of his own affection and the hopes of subduing aversion in the lady by perseverance
he begged that in an affair on which depended all his future repose he might at least be at liberty to try all fair means for success
heaven forbid he said that he should ever think of prevailing by any other than the most gentle methods
besides sir said he if they fail you may then which will be surely time enough deny your consent he urged the great and eager desire which mr western had for the match and lastly he made great use of the name of jones to whom he imputed all that had happened and from whom he said to preserve so valuable a young lady was even an act of charity
all these arguments were well seconded by thwackum who dwelt a little stronger on the authority of parents than mr blifil himself had done
he ascribed the measures which mr blifil was desirous to take to christian motives and though says he the good young gentleman hath mentioned charity last i am almost convinced it is his first and principal consideration  square possibly had he been present would have sung to the same tune though in a different key and would have discovered much moral fitness in the proceeding but he was now gone to bath for the recovery of his health
allworthy though not without reluctance at last yielded to the desires of his nephew
he said he would accompany him to london where he might be at liberty to use every honest endeavour to gain the lady but i declare said he i will never give my consent to any absolute force being put on her inclinations nor shall you ever have her unless she can be brought freely to compliance  thus did the affection of allworthy for his nephew betray the superior understanding to be triumphed over by the inferior and thus is the prudence of the best of heads often defeated by the tenderness of the best of hearts
blifil having obtained this unhopedfor acquiescence in his uncle rested not till he carried his purpose into execution
and as no immediate business required mr allworthy's presence in the country and little preparation is necessary to men for a journey they set out the very next day and arrived in town that evening when mr jones as we have seen was diverting himself with partridge at the play
the morning after his arrival mr blifil waited on mr western by whom he was most kindly and graciously received and from whom he had every possible assurance perhaps more than was possible that he should very shortly be as happy as sophia could make him nor would the squire suffer the young gentleman to return to his uncle till he had almost against his will carried him to his sister
chapter vii
in which mr western pays a visit to his sister in company with mr blifil
mrs western was reading a lecture on prudence and matrimonial politics to her niece when her brother and blifil broke in with less ceremony than the laws of visiting require
sophia no sooner saw blifil than she turned pale and almost lost the use of all her faculties but her aunt on the contrary waxed red and having all her faculties at command began to exert her tongue on the squire
brother said she i am astonished at your behaviour will you never learn any regard to decorum
will you still look upon every apartment as your own or as belonging to one of your country tenants
do you think yourself at liberty to invade the privacies of women of condition without the least decency or noticewhy what a pox is the matter now quoth the squire one would think i had caught you atnone of your brutality sir i beseech you answered sheyou have surprized my poor niece so that she can hardly i see support herselfgo my dear retire and endeavour to recruit your spirits for i see you have occasion at which words sophia who never received a more welcome command hastily withdrew
to be sure sister cries the squire you are mad when i have brought mr blifil here to court her to force her away  sure brother says she you are worse than mad when you know in what situation affairs are toi am sure i ask mr blifil's pardon but he knows very well to whom to impute so disagreeable a reception
for my own part i am sure i shall always be very glad to see mr blifil but his own good sense would not have suffered him to proceed so abruptly had you not compelled him to it  blifil bowed and stammered and looked like a fool but western without giving him time to form a speech for the purpose answered well well i am to blame if you will i always am certainly but come let the girl be fetched back again or let mr blifil go to herhe's come up on purpose and there is no time to be lost  brother cries mrs western mr blifil i am confident understands himself better than to think of seeing my niece any more this morning after what hath happened
women are of a nice contexture and our spirits when disordered are not to be recomposed in a moment
had you suffered mr blifil to have sent his compliments to my niece and to have desired the favour of waiting on her in the afternoon i should possibly have prevailed on her to have seen him but now i despair of bringing about any such matter  i am very sorry madam cried blifil that mr western's extraordinary kindness to me which i can never enough acknowledge should have occasioned indeed sir said she interrupting him you need make no apologies we all know my brother so well  i don't care what anybody knows of me answered the squirebut when must he come to see her
for consider i tell you he is come up on purpose and so is allworthybrother said she whatever message mr blifil thinks proper to send to my niece shall be delivered to her and i suppose she will want no instructions to make a proper answer
i am convinced she will not refuse to see mr blifil at a proper timethe devil she won't answered the squireodsbuddon't we knowi say nothing but some volk are wiser than all the worldif i might have had my will she had not run away before and now i expect to hear every moment she is guone again
for as great a fool as some volk think me i know very well she hates no matter brother replied mrs western i will not hear my niece abused
it is a reflection on my family
she is an honour to it and she will be an honour to it i promise you
i will pawn my whole reputation in the world on her conducti shall be glad to see you brother in the afternoon for i have somewhat of importance to mention to youat present mr blifil as well as you must excuse me for i am in haste to dress well but said the squire do appoint a time indeed said she i can appoint no time
i tell you i will see you in the afternoonwhat the devil would you have me do cries the squire turning to blifil i can no more turn her than a beagle can turn an old hare
perhaps she will be in a better humour in the afternooni am condemned i see sir to misfortune answered blifil but i shall always own my obligations to you he then took a ceremonious leave of mrs western who was altogether as ceremonious on her part and then they departed the squire muttering to himself with an oath that blifil should see his daughter in the afternoon
if mr western was little pleased with this interview blifil was less
as to the former he imputed the whole behaviour of his sister to her humour only and to her dissatisfaction at the omission of ceremony in the visit but blifil saw a little deeper into things
he suspected somewhat of more consequence from two or three words which dropt from the lady and to say the truth he suspected right as will appear when i have unfolded the several matters which will be contained in the following chapter
chapter viii
schemes of lady bellaston for the ruin of jones
love had taken too deep a root in the mind of lord fellamar to be plucked up by the rude hands of mr western
in the heat of resentment he had indeed given a commission to captain egglane which the captain had far exceeded in the execution nor had it been executed at all had his lordship been able to find the captain after he had seen lady bellaston which was in the afternoon of the day after he had received the affront but so industrious was the captain in the discharge of his duty that having after long enquiry found out the squire's lodgings very late in the evening he sat up all night at a tavern that he might not miss the squire in the morning and by that means missed the revocation which my lord had sent to his lodgings
in the afternoon then next after the intended rape of sophia his lordship as we have said made a visit to lady bellaston who laid open so much of the character of the squire that his lordship plainly saw the absurdity he had been guilty of in taking any offence at his words especially as he had those honourable designs on his daughter
he then unbosomed the violence of his passion to lady bellaston who readily undertook the cause and encouraged him with certain assurance of a most favourable reception from all the elders of the family and from the father himself when he should be sober and should be made acquainted with the nature of the offer made to his daughter
the only danger she said lay in the fellow she had formerly mentioned who though a beggar and a vagabond had by some means or other she knew not what procured himself tolerable cloaths and past for a gentleman
now says she as i have for the sake of my cousin made it my business to enquire after this fellow i have luckily found out his lodgings with which she then acquainted his lordship
i am thinking my lord added she for this fellow is too mean for your personal resentment whether it would not be possible for your lordship to contrive some method of having him pressed and sent on board a ship
neither law nor conscience forbid this project for the fellow i promise you however well drest is but a vagabond and as proper as any fellow in the streets to be pressed into the service and as for the conscientious part surely the preservation of a young lady from such ruin is a most meritorious act nay with regard to the fellow himself unless he could succeed which heaven forbid with my cousin it may probably be the means of preserving him from the gallows and perhaps may make his fortune in an honest way  lord fellamar very heartily thanked her ladyship for the part which she was pleased to take in the affair upon the success of which his whole future happiness entirely depended
he said he saw at present no objection to the pressing scheme and would consider of putting it in execution
he then most earnestly recommended to her ladyship to do him the honour of immediately mentioning his proposals to the family to whom he said he offered a carte blanche and would settle his fortune in almost any manner they should require
and after uttering many ecstasies and raptures concerning sophia he took his leave and departed but not before he had received the strongest charge to beware of jones and to lose no time in securing his person where he should no longer be in a capacity of making any attempts to the ruin of the young lady
the moment mrs western was arrived at her lodgings a card was despatched with her compliments to lady bellaston who no sooner received it than with the impatience of a lover she flew to her cousin rejoiced at this fair opportunity which beyond her hopes offered itself for she was much better pleased with the prospect of making the proposals to a woman of sense and who knew the world than to a gentleman whom she honoured with the appellation of hottentot though indeed from him she apprehended no danger of a refusal
the two ladies being met after very short previous ceremonials fell to business which was indeed almost as soon concluded as begun for mrs western no sooner heard the name of lord fellamar than her cheeks glowed with pleasure but when she was acquainted with the eagerness of his passion the earnestness of his proposals and the generosity of his offer she declared her full satisfaction in the most explicit terms
in the progress of their conversation their discourse turned to jones and both cousins very pathetically lamented the unfortunate attachment which both agreed sophia had to that young fellow and mrs western entirely attributed it to the folly of her brother's management
she concluded however at last with declaring her confidence in the good understanding of her niece who though she would not give up her affection in favour of blifil will i doubt not says she soon be prevailed upon to sacrifice a simple inclination to the addresses of a fine gentleman who brings her both a title and a large estate for indeed added she i must do sophy the justice to confess this blifil is but a hideous kind of fellow as you know bellaston all country gentlemen are and hath nothing but his fortune to recommend him  nay said lady bellaston i don't then so much wonder at my cousin for i promise you this jones is a very agreeable fellow and hath one virtue which the men say is a great recommendation to us
what do you think mrs westerni shall certainly make you laugh nay i can hardly tell you myself for laughingwill you believe that the fellow hath had the assurance to make love to me
but if you should be inclined to disbelieve it here is evidence enough his own handwriting i assure you she then delivered her cousin the letter with the proposals of marriage which if the reader hath a desire to see he will find already on record in the xvth book of this history
upon my word i am astonished said mrs western this is indeed a masterpiece of assurance
with your leave i may possibly make some use of this letter you have my full liberty cries lady bellaston to apply it to what purpose you please
however i would not have it shewn to any but miss western nor to her unless you find occasion  well and how did you use the fellow returned mrs western
not as a husband said the lady i am not married i promise you my dear
you know bell i have tried the comforts once already and once i think is enough for any reasonable woman  this letter lady bellaston thought would certainly turn the balance against jones in the mind of sophia and she was emboldened to give it up partly by her hopes of having him instantly dispatched out of the way and partly by having secured the evidence of honour who upon sounding her she saw sufficient reason to imagine was prepared to testify whatever she pleased
but perhaps the reader may wonder why lady bellaston who in her heart hated sophia should be so desirous of promoting a match which was so much to the interest of the young lady
now i would desire such readers to look carefully into human nature page almost the last and there he will find in scarce legible characters that women notwithstanding the preposterous behaviour of mothers aunts c in matrimonial matters do in reality think it so great a misfortune to have their inclinations in love thwarted that they imagine they ought never to carry enmity higher than upon these disappointments again he will find it written much about the same place that a woman who hath once been pleased with the possession of a man will go above halfway to the devil to prevent any other woman from enjoying the same
if he will not be contented with these reasons i freely confess i see no other motive to the actions of that lady unless we will conceive she was bribed by lord fellamar which for my own part i see no cause to suspect
now this was the affair which mrs western was preparing to introduce to sophia by some prefatory discourse on the folly of love and on the wisdom of legal prostitution for hire when her brother and blifil broke abruptly in upon her and hence arose all that coldness in her behaviour to blifil which though the squire as was usual with him imputed to a wrong cause infused into blifil himself he being a much more cunning man a suspicion of the real truth
chapter ix
in which jones pays a visit to mrs fitzpatrick
the reader may now perhaps be pleased to return with us to mr jones who at the appointed hour attended on mrs fitzpatrick but before we relate the conversation which now past it may be proper according to our method to return a little back and to account for so great an alteration of behaviour in this lady that from changing her lodging principally to avoid mr jones she had now industriously as hath been seen sought this interview
and here we shall need only to resort to what happened the preceding day when hearing from lady bellaston that mr western was arrived in town she went to pay her duty to him at his lodgings at piccadilly where she was received with many scurvy compellations too coarse to be repeated and was even threatened to be kicked out of doors
from hence an old servant of her aunt western with whom she was well acquainted conducted her to the lodgings of that lady who treated her not more kindly but more politely or to say the truth with rudeness in another way
in short she returned from both plainly convinced not only that her scheme of reconciliation had proved abortive but that she must for ever give over all thoughts of bringing it about by any means whatever
from this moment desire of revenge only filled her mind and in this temper meeting jones at the play an opportunity seemed to her to occur of effecting this purpose
the reader must remember that he was acquainted by mrs fitzpatrick in the account she gave of her own story with the fondness mrs western had formerly shewn for mr fitzpatrick at bath from the disappointment of which mrs fitzpatrick derived the great bitterness her aunt had expressed toward her
she had therefore no doubt but that the good lady would as easily listen to the addresses of mr jones as she had before done to the other for the superiority of charms was clearly on the side of mr jones and the advance which her aunt had since made in age she concluded how justly i will not say was an argument rather in favour of her project than against it
therefore when jones attended after a previous declaration of her desire of serving him arising as she said from a firm assurance how much she should by so doing oblige sophia and after some excuses for her former disappointment and after acquainting mr jones in whose custody his mistress was of which she thought him ignorant she very explicitly mentioned her scheme to him and advised him to make sham addresses to the older lady in order to procure an easy access to the younger informing him at the same time of the success which mr fitzpatrick had formerly owed to the very same stratagem
mr jones expressed great gratitude to the lady for the kind intentions towards him which she had expressed and indeed testified by this proposal but besides intimating some diffidence of success from the lady's knowledge of his love to her niece which had not been her case in regard to mr fitzpatrick he said he was afraid miss western would never agree to an imposition of this kind as well from her utter detestation of all fallacy as from her avowed duty to her aunt
mrs fitzpatrick was a little nettled at this and indeed if it may not be called a lapse of the tongue it was a small deviation from politeness in jones and into which he scarce would have fallen had not the delight he felt in praising sophia hurried him out of all reflection for this commendation of one cousin was more than a tacit rebuke on the other
indeed sir answered the lady with some warmth i cannot think there is anything easier than to cheat an old woman with a profession of love when her complexion is amorous and though she is my aunt i must say there never was a more liquorish one than her ladyship
can't you pretend that the despair of possessing her niece from her being promised to blifil has made you turn your thoughts towards her
as to my cousin sophia i can't imagine her to be such a simpleton as to have the least scruple on such an account or to conceive any harm in punishing one of these haggs for the many mischiefs they bring upon families by their tragicomic passions for which i think it is a pity they are not punishable by law
i had no such scruple myself and yet i hope my cousin sophia will not think it an affront when i say she cannot detest every real species of falsehood more than her cousin fitzpatrick
to my aunt indeed i pretend no duty nor doth she deserve any
however sir i have given you my advice and if you decline pursuing it i shall have the less opinion of your understandingthat's all  jones now clearly saw the error he had committed and exerted his utmost power to rectify it but he only faultered and stuttered into nonsense and contradiction
to say the truth it is often safer to abide by the consequences of the first blunder than to endeavour to rectify it for by such endeavours we generally plunge deeper instead of extricating ourselves and few persons will on such occasions have the goodnature which mrs fitzpatrick displayed to jones by saying with a smile you need attempt no more excuses for i can easily forgive a real lover whatever is the effect of fondness for his mistress  she then renewed her proposal and very fervently recommended it omitting no argument which her invention could suggest on the subject for she was so violently incensed against her aunt that scarce anything was capable of affording her equal pleasure with exposing her and like a true woman she would see no difficulties in the execution of a favourite scheme
jones however persisted in declining the undertaking which had not indeed the least probability of success
he easily perceived the motives which induced mrs fitzpatrick to be so eager in pressing her advice
he said he would not deny the tender and passionate regard he had for sophia but was so conscious of the inequality of their situations that he could never flatter himself so far as to hope that so divine a young lady would condescend to think on so unworthy a man nay he protested he could scarce bring himself to wish she should
he concluded with a profession of generous sentiments which we have not at present leisure to insert
there are some fine women for i dare not here speak in too general terms with whom self is so predominant that they never detach it from any subject and as vanity is with them a ruling principle they are apt to lay hold of whatever praise they meet with and though the property of others convey it to their own use
in the company of these ladies it is impossible to say anything handsome of another woman which they will not apply to themselves nay they often improve the praise they seize as for instance if her beauty her wit her gentility her good humour deserve so much commendation what do i deserve who possess those qualities in so much more eminent a degree
to these ladies a man often recommends himself while he is commending another woman and while he is expressing ardour and generous sentiments for his mistress they are considering what a charming lover this man would make to them who can feel all this tenderness for an inferior degree of merit
of this strange as it may seem i have seen many instances besides mrs fitzpatrick to whom all this really happened and who now began to feel a somewhat for mr jones the symptoms of which she much sooner understood than poor sophia had formerly done
to say the truth perfect beauty in both sexes is a more irresistible object than it is generally thought for notwithstanding some of us are contented with more homely lots and learn by rote as children to repeat what gives them no idea to despise outside and to value more solid charms yet i have always observed at the approach of consummate beauty that these more solid charms only shine with that kind of lustre which the stars have after the rising of the sun
when jones had finished his exclamations many of which would have become the mouth of orondates himself mrs fitzpatrick heaved a deep sigh and taking her eyes off from jones on whom they had been some time fixed and dropping them on the ground she cried indeed mr jones i pity you but it is the curse of such tenderness to be thrown away on those who are insensible of it
i know my cousin better than you mr jones and i must say any woman who makes no return to such a passion and such a person is unworthy of both  sure madam said jones you can't mean mean cries mrs fitzpatrick i know not what i mean there is something i think in true tenderness bewitching few women ever meet with it in men and fewer still know how to value it when they do
i never heard such truly noble sentiments and i can't tell how it is but you force one to believe you
sure she must be the most contemptible of women who can overlook such merit  the manner and look with which all this was spoke infused a suspicion into jones which we don't care to convey in direct words to the reader
instead of making any answer he said i am afraid madam i have made too tiresome a visit and offered to take his leave
not at all sir answered mrs fitzpatrickindeed i pity you mr jones indeed i do but if you are going consider of the scheme i have mentionedi am convinced you will approve itand let me see you again as soon as you cantomorrow morning if you will or at least some time tomorrow
i shall be at home all day  jones then after many expressions of thanks very respectfully retired nor could mrs fitzpatrick forbear making him a present of a look at parting by which if he had understood nothing he must have had no understanding in the language of the eyes
in reality it confirmed his resolution of returning to her no more for faulty as he hath hitherto appeared in this history his whole thoughts were now so confined to his sophia that i believe no woman upon earth could have now drawn him into an act of inconstancy
fortune however who was not his friend resolved as he intended to give her no second opportunity to make the best of this and accordingly produced the tragical incident which we are now in sorrowful notes to record
chapter x
the consequence of the preceding visit
mr fitzpatrick having received the letter before mentioned from mrs western and being by that means acquainted with the place to which his wife was retired returned directly to bath and thence the day after set forward to london
the reader hath been already often informed of the jealous temper of this gentleman
he may likewise be pleased to remember the suspicion which he had conceived of jones at upton upon his finding him in the room with mrs waters and though sufficient reasons had afterwards appeared entirely to clear up that suspicion yet now the reading so handsome a character of mr jones from his wife caused him to reflect that she likewise was in the inn at the same time and jumbled together such a confusion of circumstances in a head which was naturally none of the clearest that the whole produced that greeneyed monster mentioned by shakespear in his tragedy of othello
and now as he was enquiring in the street after his wife and had just received directions to the door unfortunately mr jones was issuing from it
fitzpatrick did not yet recollect the face of jones however seeing a young welldressed fellow coming from his wife he made directly up to him and asked him what he had been doing in that house
for i am sure said he you must have been in it as i saw you come out of it  jones answered very modestly that he had been visiting a lady there to which fitzpatrick replied what business have you with the lady upon which jones who now perfectly remembered the voice features and indeed coat of the gentleman cried outha my good friend
give me your hand i hope there is no ill blood remaining between us upon a small mistake which happened so long ago  upon my soul sir said fitzpatrick i don't know your name nor your face indeed sir said jones neither have i the pleasure of knowing your name but your face i very well remember to have seen before at upton where a foolish quarrel happened between us which if it is not made up yet we will now make up over a bottle  at upton cried the otherha
upon my soul i believe your name is jones indeed answered he it iso
upon my soul cries fitzpatrick you are the very man i wanted to meetupon my soul i will drink a bottle with you presently but first i will give you a great knock over the pate
there is for you you rascal
upon my soul if you do not give me satisfaction for that blow i will give you another and then drawing his sword put himself in a posture of defence which was the only science he understood
jones was a little staggered by the blow which came somewhat unexpectedly but presently recovering himself he also drew and though he understood nothing of fencing prest on so boldly upon fitzpatrick that he beat down his guard and sheathed one half of his sword in the body of the said gentleman who had no sooner received it than he stept backwards dropped the point of his sword and leaning upon it cried i have satisfaction enough i am a dead man  i hope not cries jones but whatever be the consequence you must be sensible you have drawn it upon yourself at this instant a number of fellows rushed in and seized jones who told them he should make no resistance and begged some of them at least would take care of the wounded gentleman
ay cries one of the fellows the wounded gentleman will be taken care enough of for i suppose he hath not many hours to live
as for you sir you have a month at least good yet dn me jack said another he hath prevented his voyage he's bound to another port now and many other such jests was our poor jones made the subject of by these fellows who were indeed the gang employed by lord fellamar and had dogged him into the house of mrs fitzpatrick waiting for him at the corner of the street when this unfortunate accident happened
the officer who commanded this gang very wisely concluded that his business was now to deliver his prisoner into the hands of the civil magistrate
he ordered him therefore to be carried to a publichouse where having sent for a constable he delivered him to his custody
the constable seeing mr jones very well drest and hearing that the accident had happened in a duel treated his prisoner with great civility and at his request dispatched a messenger to enquire after the wounded gentleman who was now at a tavern under the surgeon's hands
the report brought back was that the wound was certainly mortal and there were no hopes of life
upon which the constable informed jones that he must go before a justice
he answered wherever you please i am indifferent as to what happens to me for though i am convinced i am not guilty of murder in the eye of the law yet the weight of blood i find intolerable upon my mind  jones was now conducted before the justice where the surgeon who dressed mr fitzpatrick appeared and deposed that he believed the wound to be mortal upon which the prisoner was committed to the gatehouse
it was very late at night so that jones would not send for partridge till the next morning and as he never shut his eyes till seven so it was near twelve before the poor fellow who was greatly frightened at not hearing from his master so long received a message which almost deprived him of his being when he heard it
he went to the gatehouse with trembling knees and a beating heart and was no sooner arrived in the presence of jones than he lamented the misfortune that had befallen him with many tears looking all the while frequently about him in great terror for as the news now arrived that mr fitzpatrick was dead the poor fellow apprehended every minute that his ghost would enter the room
at last he delivered him a letter which he had like to have forgot and which came from sophia by the hands of black george
jones presently dispatched every one out of the room and having eagerly broke open the letter read as follows    you owe the hearing from me again to an accident which i own   surprizes me
my aunt hath just now shown me a letter from you to   lady bellaston which contains a proposal of marriage
i am   convinced it is your own hand and what more surprizes me is that   it is dated at the very time when you would have me imagine you was   under such concern on my accounti leave you to comment on this   fact
all i desire is that your name may never more be mentioned   to                                                s
w  of the present situation of mr jones's mind and of the pangs with which he was now tormented we cannot give the reader a better idea than by saying his misery was such that even thwackum would almost have pitied him
but bad as it is we shall at present leave him in it as his good genius if he really had any seems to have done
and here we put an end to the sixteenth book of our history
book xvii
containing three days
chapter i
containing a portion of introductory writing
when a comic writer hath made his principal characters as happy as he can or when a tragic writer hath brought them to the highest pitch of human misery they both conclude their business to be done and that their work is come to a period
had we been of the tragic complexion the reader must now allow we were very nearly arrived at this period since it would be difficult for the devil or any of his representatives on earth to have contrived much greater torments for poor jones than those in which we left him in the last chapter and as for sophia a goodnatured woman would hardly wish more uneasiness to a rival than what she must at present be supposed to feel
what then remains to complete the tragedy but a murder or two and a few moral sentences
but to bring our favourites out of their present anguish and distress and to land them at last on the shore of happiness seems a much harder task a task indeed so hard that we do not undertake to execute it
in regard to sophia it is more than probable that we shall somewhere or other provide a good husband for her in the endeither blifil or my lord or somebody else but as to poor jones such are the calamities in which he is at present involved owing to his imprudence by which if a man doth not become felon to the world he is at least a felo de se so destitute is he now of friends and so persecuted by enemies that we almost despair of bringing him to any good and if our reader delights in seeing executions i think he ought not to lose any time in taking a first row at tyburn
this i faithfully promise that notwithstanding any affection which we may be supposed to have for this rogue whom we have unfortunately made our heroe we will lend him none of that supernatural assistance with which we are entrusted upon condition that we use it only on very important occasions
if he doth not therefore find some natural means of fairly extricating himself from all his distresses we will do no violence to the truth and dignity of history for his sake for we had rather relate that he was hanged at tyburn which may very probably be the case than forfeit our integrity or shock the faith of our reader
in this the antients had a great advantage over the moderns
their mythology which was at that time more firmly believed by the vulgar than any religion is at present gave them always an opportunity of delivering a favourite heroe
their deities were always ready at the writer's elbow to execute any of his purposes and the more extraordinary the invention was the greater was the surprize and delight of the credulous reader
those writers could with greater ease have conveyed a heroe from one country to another nay from one world to another and have brought him back again than a poor circumscribed modern can deliver him from a jail
the arabians and persians had an equal advantage in writing their tales from the genii and fairies which they believe in as an article of their faith upon the authority of the koran itself
but we have none of these helps
to natural means alone we are confined let us try therefore what by these means may be done for poor jones though to confess the truth something whispers me in the ear that he doth not yet know the worst of his fortune and that a more shocking piece of news than any he hath yet heard remains for him in the unopened leaves of fate
chapter ii
the generous and grateful behaviour of mrs miller
mr allworthy and mrs miller were just sat down to breakfast when blifil who had gone out very early that morning returned to make one of the company
he had not been long seated before he began as follows good lord
my dear uncle what do you think hath happened
i vow i am afraid of telling it you for fear of shocking you with the remembrance of ever having shewn any kindness to such a villain what is the matter child said the uncle
i fear i have shewn kindness in my life to the unworthy more than once
but charity doth not adopt the vices of its objects o sir returned blifil it is not without the secret direction of providence that you mention the word adoption
your adopted son sir that jones that wretch whom you nourished in your bosom hath proved one of the greatest villains upon earth by all that's sacred 'tis false cries mrs miller
mr jones is no villain
he is one of the worthiest creatures breathing and if any other person had called him villain i would have thrown all this boiling water in his face mr allworthy looked very much amazed at this behaviour
but she did not give him leave to speak before turning to him she cried i hope you will not be angry with me i would not offend you sir for the world but indeed i could not bear to hear him called so i must own madam said allworthy very gravely i am a little surprized to hear you so warmly defend a fellow you do not know o
i do know him mr allworthy said she indeed i do i should be the most ungrateful of all wretches if i denied it
o
he hath preserved me and my little family we have all reason to bless him while we liveand i pray heaven to bless him and turn the hearts of his malicious enemies
i know i find i see he hath such  you surprize me madam still more said allworthy sure you must mean some other
it is impossible you should have any such obligations to the man my nephew mentions too surely answered she i have obligations to him of the greatest and tenderest kind
he hath been the preserver of me and mine
believe me sir he hath been abused grossly abused to you i know he hath or you whom i know to be all goodness and honour would not after the many kind and tender things i have heard you say of this poor helpless child have so disdainfully called him fellowindeed my best of friends he deserves a kinder appellation from you had you heard the good the kind the grateful things which i have heard him utter of you
he never mentions your name but with a sort of adoration
in this very room i have seen him on his knees imploring all the blessings of heaven upon your head
i do not love that child there better than he loves you  i see sir now said blifil with one of those grinning sneers with which the devil marks his best beloved mrs miller really doth know him
i suppose you will find she is not the only one of your acquaintance to whom he hath exposed you
as for my character i perceive by some hints she hath thrown out he hath been very free with it but i forgive him and the lord forgive you sir said mrs miller we have all sins enough to stand in need of his forgiveness  upon my word mrs miller said allworthy i do not take this behaviour of yours to my nephew kindly and i do assure you as any reflections which you cast upon him must come only from that wickedest of men they would only serve if that were possible to heighten my resentment against him for i must tell you mrs miller the young man who now stands before you hath ever been the warmest advocate for the ungrateful wretch whose cause you espouse
this i think when you hear it from my own mouth will make you wonder at so much baseness and ingratitude  you are deceived sir answered mrs miller if they were the last words which were to issue from my lips i would say you were deceived and i once more repeat it the lord forgive those who have deceived you
i do not pretend to say the young man is without faults but they are all the faults of wildness and of youth faults which he may nay which i am certain he will relinquish and if he should not they are vastly overbalanced by one of the most humane tender honest hearts that ever man was blest with  indeed mrs miller said allworthy had this been related of you i should not have believed it indeed sir answered she you will believe everything i have said i am sure you will and when you have heard the story which i shall tell you for i will tell you all you will be so far from being offended that you will own i know your justice so well that i must have been the most despicable and most ungrateful of wretches if i had acted any other part than i have  well madam said allworthy i shall be very glad to hear any good excuse for a behaviour which i must confess i think wants an excuse
and now madam will you be pleased to let my nephew proceed in his story without interruption
he would not have introduced a matter of slight consequence with such a preface
perhaps even this story will cure you of your mistake  mrs miller gave tokens of submission and then mr blifil began thus i am sure sir if you don't think proper to resent the illusage of mrs miller i shall easily forgive what affects me only
i think your goodness hath not deserved this indignity at her hands well child said allworthy but what is this new instance
what hath he done of late what cries blifil notwithstanding all mrs miller hath said i am very sorry to relate and what you should never have heard from me had it not been a matter impossible to conceal from the whole world
in short he hath killed a man i will not say murderedfor perhaps it may not be so construed in law and i hope the best for his sake  allworthy looked shocked and blessed himself and then turning to mrs miller he cried well madam what say you now  why i say sir answered she that i never was more concerned at anything in my life but if the fact be true i am convinced the man whoever he is was in fault
heaven knows there are many villains in this town who make it their business to provoke young gentlemen
nothing but the greatest provocation could have tempted him for of all the gentlemen i ever had in my house i never saw one so gentle or so sweettempered
he was beloved by every one in the house and every one who came near it  while she was thus running on a violent knocking at the door interrupted their conversation and prevented her from proceeding further or from receiving any answer for as she concluded this was a visitor to mr allworthy she hastily retired taking with her her little girl whose eyes were all over blubbered at the melancholy news she heard of jones who used to call her his little wife and not only gave her many playthings but spent whole hours in playing with her himself
some readers may perhaps be pleased with these minute circumstances in relating of which we follow the example of plutarch one of the best of our brother historians and others to whom they may appear trivial will we hope at least pardon them as we are never prolix on such occasions
chapter iii
the arrival of mr western with some matters concerning the paternal authority
mrs miller had not long left the room when mr western entered but not before a small wrangling bout had passed between him and his chairmen for the fellows who had taken up their burden at the hercules pillars had conceived no hopes of having any future good customer in the squire and they were moreover farther encouraged by his generosity for he had given them of his own accord sixpence more than their fare they therefore very boldly demanded another shilling which so provoked the squire that he not only bestowed many hearty curses on them at the door but retained his anger after he came into the room swearing that all the londoners were like the court and thought of nothing but plundering country gentlemen
dn me says he if i won't walk in the rain rather than get into one of their handbarrows again
they have jolted me more in a mile than brown bess would in a long foxchase  when his wrath on this occasion was a little appeased he resumed the same passionate tone on another
there says he there is fine business forwards now
the hounds have changed at last and when we imagined we had a fox to deal with odrat it it turns out to be a badger at last  pray my good neighbour said allworthy drop your metaphors and speak a little plainer why then says the squire to tell you plainly we have been all this time afraid of a son of a whore of a bastard of somebody's i don't know whose not i
and now here's a confounded son of a whore of a lord who may be a bastard too for what i know or care for he shall never have a daughter of mine by my consent
they have beggared the nation but they shall never beggar me
my land shall never be sent over to hanover  you surprize me much my good friend said allworthy
why zounds
i am surprized myself answered the squire
i went to zee sister western last night according to her own appointment and there i was had into a whole room full of women
there was my lady cousin bellaston and my lady betty and my lady catherine and my lady i don't know who dn me if ever you catch me among such a kennel of hooppetticoat bs
dn me i'd rather be run by my own dogs as one acton was that the storybook says was turned into a hare and his own dogs killed un and eat un
odrabbit it no mortal was ever run in such a manner if i dodged one way one had me if i offered to clap back another snapped me
o
certainly one of the greatest matches in england' says one cousin here he attempted to mimic them a very advantageous offer indeed' cries another cousin for you must know they be all my cousins thof i never zeed half o' um before
surely' says that fat ase b my lady bellaston cousin you must be out of your wits to think of refusing such an offer
'  now i begin to understand says allworthy some person hath made proposals to miss western which the ladies of the family approve but is not to your liking  my liking said western how the devil should it
i tell you it is a lord and those are always volks whom you know i always resolved to have nothing to do with
did unt i refuse a matter of vorty years' purchase now for a bit of land which one o' um had a mind to put into a park only because i would have no dealings with lords and dost think i would marry my daughter zu
besides ben't i engaged to you and did i ever go off any bargain when i had promised  as to that point neighbour said allworthy i entirely release you from any engagement
no contract can be binding between parties who have not a full power to make it at the time nor ever afterwards acquire the power of fulfilling it  slud
then answered western i tell you i have power and i will fulfil it
come along with me directly to doctors' commons i will get a licence and i will go to sister and take away the wench by force and she shall ha un or i will lock her up and keep her upon bread and water as long as she lives  mr western said allworthy shall i beg you will hear my full sentiments on this matterhear thee ay to be sure i will  answered he
why then sir cries allworthy i can truly say without a compliment either to you or the young lady that when this match was proposed i embraced it very readily and heartily from my regard to you both
an alliance between two families so nearly neighbours and between whom there had always existed so mutual an intercourse and good harmony i thought a most desirable event and with regard to the young lady not only the concurrent opinion of all who knew her but my own observation assured me that she would be an inestimable treasure to a good husband
i shall say nothing of her personal qualifications which certainly are admirable her good nature her charitable disposition her modesty are too well known to need any panegyric but she hath one quality which existed in a high degree in that best of women who is now one of the first of angels which as it is not of a glaring kind more commonly escapes observation so little indeed is it remarked that i want a word to express it
i must use negatives on this occasion
i never heard anything of pertness or what is called repartee out of her mouth no pretence to wit much less to that kind of wisdom which is the result only of great learning and experience the affectation of which in a young woman is as absurd as any of the affectations of an ape
no dictatorial sentiments no judicial opinions no profound criticisms
whenever i have seen her in the company of men she hath been all attention with the modesty of a learner not the forwardness of a teacher
you'll pardon me for it but i once to try her only desired her opinion on a point which was controverted between mr thwackum and mr square
to which she answered with much sweetness you will pardon me good mr allworthy i am sure you cannot in earnest think me capable of deciding any point in which two such gentlemen disagree'
thwackum and square who both alike thought themselves sure of a favourable decision seconded my request
she answered with the same good humour i must absolutely be excused for i will affront neither so much as to give my judgment on his side'
indeed she always shewed the highest deference to the understandings of men a quality absolutely essential to the making a good wife
i shall only add that as she is most apparently void of all affectation this deference must be certainly real  here blifil sighed bitterly upon which western whose eyes were full of tears at the praise of sophia blubbered out don't be chickenhearted for shat ha her dn me shat ha her if she was twenty times as good  remember your promise sir cried allworthy i was not to be interrupted well shat unt answered the squire i won't speak another word  now my good friend continued allworthy i have dwelt so long on the merit of this young lady partly as i really am in love with her character and partly that fortune for the match in that light is really advantageous on my nephew's side might not be imagined to be my principal view in having so eagerly embraced the proposal
indeed i heartily wished to receive so great a jewel into my family but though i may wish for many good things i would not therefore steal them or be guilty of any violence or injustice to possess myself of them
now to force a woman into a marriage contrary to her consent or approbation is an act of such injustice and oppression that i wish the laws of our country could restrain it but a good conscience is never lawless in the worst regulated state and will provide those laws for itself which the neglect of legislators hath forgotten to supply
this is surely a case of that kind for is it not cruel nay impious to force a woman into that state against her will for her behaviour in which she is to be accountable to the highest and most dreadful court of judicature and to answer at the peril of her soul
to discharge the matrimonial duties in an adequate manner is no easy task and shall we lay this burthen upon a woman while we at the same time deprive her of all that assistance which may enable her to undergo it
shall we tear her very heart from her while we enjoin her duties to which a whole heart is scarce equal
i must speak very plainly here
i think parents who act in this manner are accessories to all the guilt which their children afterwards incur and of course must before a just judge expect to partake of their punishment but if they could avoid this good heaven
is there a soul who can bear the thought of having contributed to the damnation of his child
for these reasons my best neighbour as i see the inclinations of this young lady are most unhappily averse to my nephew i must decline any further thoughts of the honour you intended him though i assure you i shall always retain the most grateful sense of it  well sir said western the froth bursting forth from his lips the moment they were uncorked you cannot say but i have heard you out and now i expect you'll hear me and if i don't answer every word on't why then i'll consent to gee the matter up
first then i desire you to answer me one questiondid not i beget her
did not i beget her
answer me that
they say indeed it is a wise father that knows his own child but i am sure i have the best title to her for i bred her up
but i believe you will allow me to be her father and if i be am i not to govern my own child
i ask you that am i not to govern my own child
and if i am to govern her in other matters surely i am to govern her in this which concerns her most
and what am i desiring all this while
am i desiring her to do anything for me
to give me anythingzu much on t'other side that i am only desiring her to take away half my estate now and t'other half when i die
well and what is it all vor
why is unt it to make her happy
it's enough to make one mad to hear volks talk if i was going to marry myself then she would ha reason to cry and to blubber but on the contrary han't i offered to bind down my land in such a manner that i could not marry if i would seeing as narro' woman upon earth would ha me
what the devil in hell can i do more
i contribute to her damnationzounds
i'd zee all the world dn'd bevore her little vinger should be hurt
indeed mr allworthy you must excuse me but i am surprized to hear you talk in zuch a manner and i must say take it how you will that i thought you had more sense  allworthy resented this reflection only with a smile nor could he if he would have endeavoured it have conveyed into that smile any mixture of malice or contempt
his smiles at folly were indeed such as we may suppose the angels bestow on the absurdities of mankind
blifil now desired to be permitted to speak a few words
as to using any violence on the young lady i am sure i shall never consent to it
my conscience will not permit me to use violence on any one much less on a lady for whom however cruel she is to me i shall always preserve the purest and sincerest affection but yet i have read that women are seldom proof against perseverance
why may i not hope then by such perseverance at last to gain those inclinations in which for the future i shall perhaps have no rival for as for this lord mr western is so kind to prefer me to him and sure sir you will not deny but that a parent hath at least a negative voice in these matters nay i have heard this very young lady herself say so more than once and declare that she thought children inexcusable who married in direct opposition to the will of their parents
besides though the other ladies of the family seem to favour the pretensions of my lord i do not find the lady herself is inclined to give him any countenance alas
i am too well assured she is not i am too sensible that wickedest of men remains uppermost in her heart  ay ay so he does cries western
but surely says blifil when she hears of this murder which he hath committed if the law should spare his life  what's that cries western
murder
hath he committed a murder and is there any hopes of seeing him hangedtol de rol tol lol de rol  here he fell a singing and capering about the room
child says allworthy this unhappy passion of yours distresses me beyond measure
i heartily pity you and would do every fair thing to promote your success  i desire no more cries blifil i am convinced my dear uncle hath a better opinion of me than to think that i myself would accept of more  lookee says allworthy you have my leave to write to visit if she will permit itbut i insist on no thoughts of violence
i will have no confinement nothing of that kind attempted  well well cries the squire nothing of that kind shall be attempted we will try a little longer what fair means will effect and if this fellow be but hanged out of the waytol lol de rol
i never heard better news in my lifei warrant everything goes to my minddo prithee dear allworthy come and dine with me at the hercules pillars i have bespoke a shoulder of mutton roasted and a sparerib of pork and a fowl and eggsauce
there will be nobody but ourselves unless we have a mind to have the landlord for i have sent parson supple down to basingstoke after my tobaccobox which i left at an inn there and i would not lose it for the world for it is an old acquaintance of above twenty years' standing
i can tell you landlord is a vast comical bitch you will like un hugely  mr allworthy at last agreed to this invitation and soon after the squire went off singing and capering at the hopes of seeing the speedy tragical end of poor jones
when he was gone mr allworthy resumed the aforesaid subject with much gravity
he told his nephew he wished with all his heart he would endeavour to conquer a passion in which i cannot says he flatter you with any hopes of succeeding
it is certainly a vulgar error that aversion in a woman may be conquered by perseverance
indifference may perhaps sometimes yield to it but the usual triumphs gained by perseverance in a lover are over caprice prudence affectation and often an exorbitant degree of levity which excites women not overwarm in their constitutions to indulge their vanity by prolonging the time of courtship even when they are well enough pleased with the object and resolve if they ever resolve at all to make him a very pitiful amends in the end
but a fixed dislike as i am afraid this is will rather gather strength than be conquered by time
besides my dear i have another apprehension which you must excuse
i am afraid this passion which you have for this fine young creature hath her beautiful person too much for its object and is unworthy of the name of that love which is the only foundation of matrimonial felicity
to admire to like and to long for the possession of a beautiful woman without any regard to her sentiments towards us is i am afraid too natural but love i believe is the child of love only at least i am pretty confident that to love the creature who we are assured hates us is not in human nature
examine your heart therefore thoroughly my good boy and if upon examination you have but the least suspicion of this kind i am sure your own virtue and religion will impel you to drive so vicious a passion from your heart and your good sense will soon enable you to do it without pain  the reader may pretty well guess blifil's answer but if he should be at a loss we are not at present at leisure to satisfy him as our history now hastens on to matters of higher importance and we can no longer bear to be absent from sophia
chapter iv
an extraordinary scene between sophia and her aunt
the lowing heifer and the bleating ewe in herds and flocks may ramble safe and unregarded through the pastures
these are indeed hereafter doomed to be the prey of man yet many years are they suffered to enjoy their liberty undisturbed
but if a plump doe be discovered to have escaped from the forest and to repose herself in some field or grove the whole parish is presently alarmed every man is ready to set his dogs after her and if she is preserved from the rest by the good squire it is only that he may secure her for his own eating
i have often considered a very fine young woman of fortune and fashion when first found strayed from the pale of her nursery to be in pretty much the same situation with this doe
the town is immediately in an uproar she is hunted from park to play from court to assembly from assembly to her own chamber and rarely escapes a single season from the jaws of some devourer or other for if her friends protect her from some it is only to deliver her over to one of their own chusing often more disagreeable to her than any of the rest while whole herds or flocks of other women securely and scarce regarded traverse the park the play the opera and the assembly and though for the most part at least they are at last devoured yet for a long time do they wanton in liberty without disturbance or controul
of all these paragons none ever tasted more of this persecution than poor sophia
her ill stars were not contented with all that she had suffered on account of blifil they now raised her another pursuer who seemed likely to torment her no less than the other had done
for though her aunt was less violent she was no less assiduous in teizing her than her father had been before
the servants were no sooner departed after dinner than mrs western who had opened the matter to sophia informed her that she expected his lordship that very afternoon and intended to take the first opportunity of leaving her alone with him if you do madam  answered sophia with some spirit i shall take the first opportunity of leaving him by himself how
madam cries the aunt is this the return you make me for my kindness in relieving you from your confinement at your father's you know madam said sophia the cause of that confinement was a refusal to comply with my father in accepting a man i detested and will my dear aunt who hath relieved me from that distress involve me in another equally bad and do you think then madam answered mrs western that there is no difference between my lord fellamar and mr blifil very little in my opinion  cries sophia and if i must be condemned to one i would certainly have the merit of sacrificing myself to my father's pleasure then my pleasure i find said the aunt hath very little weight with you but that consideration shall not move me
i act from nobler motives
the view of aggrandizing my family of ennobling yourself is what i proceed upon
have you no sense of ambition
are there no charms in the thoughts of having a coronet on your coach none upon my honour said sophia
a pincushion upon my coach would please me just as well never mention honour cries the aunt
it becomes not the mouth of such a wretch
i am sorry niece you force me to use these words but i cannot bear your groveling temper you have none of the blood of the westerns in you
but however mean and base your own ideas are you shall bring no imputation on mine
i will never suffer the world to say of me that i encouraged you in refusing one of the best matches in england a match which besides its advantage in fortune would do honour to almost any family and hath indeed in title the advantage of ours surely says sophia i am born deficient and have not the senses with which other people are blessed there must be certainly some sense which can relish the delights of sound and show which i have not for surely mankind would not labour so much nor sacrifice so much for the obtaining nor would they be so elate and proud with possessing what appeared to them as it doth to me the most insignificant of all trifles  no no miss cries the aunt you are born with as many senses as other people but i assure you you are not born with a sufficient understanding to make a fool of me or to expose my conduct to the world so i declare this to you upon my word and you know i believe how fixed my resolutions are unless you agree to see his lordship this afternoon i will with my own hands deliver you tomorrow morning to my brother and will never henceforth interfere with you nor see your face again sophia stood a few moments silent after this speech which was uttered in a most angry and peremptory tone and then bursting into tears she cryed do with me madam whatever you please i am the most miserable undone wretch upon earth if my dear aunt forsakes me where shall i look for a protector my dear niece cries she you will have a very good protector in his lordship a protector whom nothing but a hankering after that vile fellow jones can make you decline indeed madam said sophia you wrong me
how can you imagine after what you have shewn me if i had ever any such thoughts that i should not banish them for ever
if it will satisfy you i will receive the sacrament upon it never to see his face again but child dear child said the aunt be reasonable can you invent a single objection i have already i think told you a sufficient objection answered sophia
what  cries the aunt i remember none sure madam said sophia i told you he had used me in the rudest and vilest manner indeed child  answered she i never heard you or did not understand youbut what do you mean by this rude vile manner indeed madam said sophia i am almost ashamed to tell you
he caught me in his arms pulled me down upon the settee and thrust his hand into my bosom and kissed it with such violence that i have the mark upon my left breast at this moment indeed said mrs western
yes indeed madam answered sophia my father luckily came in at that instant or heaven knows what rudeness he intended to have proceeded to i am astonished and confounded cries the aunt
no woman of the name of western hath been ever treated so since we were a family
i would have torn the eyes of a prince out if he had attempted such freedoms with me
it is impossible
sure sophia you must invent this to raise my indignation against him i hope madam said sophia you have too good an opinion of me to imagine me capable of telling an untruth
upon my soul it is true i should have stabbed him to the heart had i been present returned the aunt
yet surely he could have no dishonourable design it is impossible
he durst not besides his proposals shew he hath not for they are not only honourable but generous
i don't know the age allows too great freedoms
a distant salute is all i would have allowed before the ceremony
i have had lovers formerly not so long ago neither several lovers though i never would consent to marriage and i never encouraged the least freedom
it is a foolish custom and what i never would agree to
no man kissed more of me than my cheek
it is as much as one can bring oneself to give lips up to a husband and indeed could i ever have been persuaded to marry i believe i should not have soon been brought to endure so much you will pardon me dear madam said sophia if i make one observation you own you have had many lovers and the world knows it even if you should deny it
you refused them all and i am convinced one coronet at least among them you say true dear sophy answered she i had once the offer of a title why then  said sophia will you not suffer me to refuse this once it is true child said she i have refused the offer of a title but it was not so good an offer that is not so very very good an offeryes madam said sophia but you have had very great proposals from men of vast fortunes
it was not the first nor the second nor the third advantageous match that offered itself i own it was not said she
well madam continued sophia and why may not i expect to have a second perhaps better than this
you are now but a young woman and i am convinced would not promise to yield to the first lover of fortune nay or of title too
i am a very young woman and sure i need not despair well my dear dear sophy  cries the aunt what would you have me say why i only beg that i may not be left alone at least this evening grant me that and i will submit if you think after what is past i ought to see him in your company well i will grant it cries the aunt
sophy you know i love you and can deny you nothing
you know the easiness of my nature i have not always been so easy
i have been formerly thought cruel by the men i mean
i was called the cruel parthenissa
i have broke many a window that has had verses to the cruel parthenissa in it
sophy i was never so handsome as you and yet i had something of you formerly
i am a little altered
kingdoms and states as tully cicero says in his epistles undergo alterations and so must the human form thus run she on for near half an hour upon herself and her conquests and her cruelty till the arrival of my lord who after a most tedious visit during which mrs western never once offered to leave the room retired not much more satisfied with the aunt than with the niece for sophia had brought her aunt into so excellent a temper that she consented to almost everything her niece said and agreed that a little distant behaviour might not be improper to so forward a lover
thus sophia by a little welldirected flattery for which surely none will blame her obtained a little ease for herself and at least put off the evil day
and now we have seen our heroine in a better situation than she hath been for a long time before we will look a little after mr jones whom we left in the most deplorable situation that can be well imagined
chapter v  mrs miller and mr nightingale visit jones in the prison
when mr allworthy and his nephew went to meet mr western mrs miller set forwards to her soninlaw's lodgings in order to acquaint him with the accident which had befallen his friend jones but he had known it long before from partridge for jones when he left mrs miller had been furnished with a room in the same house with mr nightingale
the good woman found her daughter under great affliction on account of mr jones whom having comforted as well as she could she set forwards to the gatehouse where she heard he was and where mr nightingale was arrived before her
the firmness and constancy of a true friend is a circumstance so extremely delightful to persons in any kind of distress that the distress itself if it be only temporary and admits of relief is more than compensated by bringing this comfort with it
nor are instances of this kind so rare as some superficial and inaccurate observers have reported
to say the truth want of compassion is not to be numbered among our general faults
the black ingredient which fouls our disposition is envy
hence our eye is seldom i am afraid turned upward to those who are manifestly greater better wiser or happier than ourselves without some degree of malignity while we commonly look downwards on the mean and miserable with sufficient benevolence and pity
in fact i have remarked that most of the defects which have discovered themselves in the friendships within my observation have arisen from envy only a hellish vice and yet one from which i have known very few absolutely exempt
but enough of a subject which if pursued would lead me too far
whether it was that fortune was apprehensive lest jones should sink under the weight of his adversity and that she might thus lose any future opportunity of tormenting him or whether she really abated somewhat of her severity towards him she seemed a little to relax her persecution by sending him the company of two such faithful friends and what is perhaps more rare a faithful servant
for partridge though he had many imperfections wanted not fidelity and though fear would not suffer him to be hanged for his master yet the world i believe could not have bribed him to desert his cause
while jones was expressing great satisfaction in the presence of his friends partridge brought an account that mr fitzpatrick was still alive though the surgeon declared that he had very little hopes
upon which jones fetching a deep sigh nightingale said to him my dear tom why should you afflict yourself so upon an accident which whatever be the consequence can be attended with no danger to you and in which your conscience cannot accuse you of having been the least to blame
if the fellow should die what have you done more than taken away the life of a ruffian in your own defence
so will the coroner's inquest certainly find it and then you will be easily admitted to bail and though you must undergo the form of a trial yet it is a trial which many men would stand for you for a shilling  come come mr jones says mrs miller chear yourself up
i knew you could not be the aggressor and so i told mr allworthy and so he shall acknowledge too before i have done with him  jones gravely answered that whatever might be his fate he should always lament the having shed the blood of one of his fellowcreatures as one of the highest misfortunes which could have befallen him
but i have another misfortune of the tenderest kindo
mrs miller i have lost what i held most dear upon earth  that must be a mistress said mrs miller but come come i know more than you imagine for indeed partridge had blabbed all and i have heard more than you know
matters go better i promise you than you think and i would not give blifil sixpence for all the chance which he hath of the lady  indeed my dear friend indeed answered jones you are an entire stranger to the cause of my grief
if you was acquainted with the story you would allow my case admitted of no comfort
i apprehend no danger from blifil
i have undone myself don't despair replied mrs miller you know not what a woman can do and if anything be in my power i promise you i will do it to serve you
it is my duty
my son my dear mr nightingale who is so kind to tell me he hath obligations to you on the same account knows it is my duty
shall i go to the lady myself
i will say anything to her you would have me say  thou best of women cries jones taking her by the hand talk not of obligations to mebut as you have been so kind to mention it there is a favour which perhaps may be in your power
i see you are acquainted with the lady how you came by your information i know not who sits indeed very near my heart
if you could contrive to deliver this giving her a paper from his pocket i shall for ever acknowledge your goodness  give it me said mrs miller
if i see it not in her own possession before i sleep may my next sleep be my last
comfort yourself my good young man
be wise enough to take warning from past follies and i warrant all shall be well and i shall yet see you happy with the most charming young lady in the world for i so hear from every one she is  believe me madam said he i do not speak the common cant of one in my unhappy situation
before this dreadful accident happened i had resolved to quit a life of which i was become sensible of the wickedness as well as folly
i do assure you notwithstanding the disturbances i have unfortunately occasioned in your house for which i heartily ask your pardon i am not an abandoned profligate
though i have been hurried into vices i do not approve a vicious character nor will i ever from this moment deserve it  mrs miller expressed great satisfaction in these declarations in the sincerity of which she averred she had an entire faith and now the remainder of the conversation past in the joint attempts of that good woman and mr nightingale to cheer the dejected spirits of mr jones in which they so far succeeded as to leave him much better comforted and satisfied than they found him to which happy alteration nothing so much contributed as the kind undertaking of mrs miller to deliver his letter to sophia which he despaired of finding any means to accomplish for when black george produced the last from sophia he informed partridge that she had strictly charged him on pain of having it communicated to her father not to bring her any answer
he was moreover not a little pleased to find he had so warm an advocate to mr allworthy himself in this good woman who was in reality one of the worthiest creatures in the world
after about an hour's visit from the lady for nightingale had been with him much longer they both took their leave promising to return to him soon during which mrs miller said she hoped to bring him some good news from his mistress and mr nightingale promised to enquire into the state of mr fitzpatrick's wound and likewise to find out some of the persons who were present at the rencounter
the former of these went directly in quest of sophia whither we likewise shall now attend her
chapter vi
in which mrs miller pays a visit to sophia
access to the young lady was by no means difficult for as she lived now on a perfect friendly footing with her aunt she was at full liberty to receive what visitants she pleased
sophia was dressing when she was acquainted that there was a gentlewoman below to wait on her
as she was neither afraid nor ashamed to see any of her own sex mrs miller was immediately admitted
curtsies and the usual ceremonials between women who are strangers to each other being past sophia said i have not the pleasure to know you madam no madam answered mrs miller and i must beg pardon for intruding upon you
but when you know what has induced me to give you this trouble i hope pray what is your business madam  said sophia with a little emotion
madam we are not alone replied mrs miller in a low voice
go out betty said sophia
when betty was departed mrs miller said i was desired madam by a very unhappy young gentleman to deliver you this letter sophia changed colour when she saw the direction well knowing the hand and after some hesitation saidi could not conceive madam from your appearance that your business had been of such a naturewhomever you brought this letter from i shall not open it
i should be sorry to entertain an unjust suspicion of any one but you are an utter stranger to me  if you will have patience madam answered mrs miller i will acquaint you who i am and how i came by that letter i have no curiosity madam to know anything cries sophia but i must insist on your delivering that letter back to the person who gave it you  mrs miller then fell upon her knees and in the most passionate terms implored her compassion to which sophia answered sure madam it is surprizing you should be so very strongly interested in the behalf of this person
i would not think madamno madam says mrs miller you shall not think anything but the truth
i will tell you all and you will not wonder that i am interested
he is the bestnatured creature that ever was bornshe then began and related the story of mr andersonafter this she cried this madam this is his goodness but i have much more tender obligations to him
he hath preserved my childhere after shedding some tears she related everything concerning that fact suppressing only those circumstances which would have most reflected on her daughter and concluded with saying now madam you shall judge whether i can ever do enough for so kind so good so generous a young man and sure he is the best and worthiest of all human beings  the alterations in the countenance of sophia had hitherto been chiefly to her disadvantage and had inclined her complexion to too great paleness but she now waxed redder if possible than vermilion and cried i know not what to say certainly what arises from gratitude cannot be blamedbut what service can my reading this letter do your friend since i am resolved never mrs miller fell again to her entreaties and begged to be forgiven but she could not she said carry it back
well madam says sophia i cannot help it if you will force it upon mecertainly you may leave it whether i will or no what sophia meant or whether she meant anything i will not presume to determine but mrs miller actually understood this as a hint and presently laying the letter down on the table took her leave having first begged permission to wait again on sophia which request had neither assent nor denial
the letter lay upon the table no longer than till mrs miller was out of sight for then sophia opened and read it
this letter did very little service to his cause for it consisted of little more than confessions of his own unworthiness and bitter lamentations of despair together with the most solemn protestations of his unalterable fidelity to sophia of which he said he hoped to convince her if he had ever more the honour of being admitted to her presence and that he could account for the letter to lady bellaston in such a manner that though it would not entitle him to her forgiveness he hoped at least to obtain it from her mercy
and concluded with vowing that nothing was ever less in his thoughts than to marry lady bellaston
though sophia read the letter twice over with great attention his meaning still remained a riddle to her nor could her invention suggest to her any means to excuse jones
she certainly remained very angry with him though indeed lady bellaston took up so much of her resentment that her gentle mind had but little left to bestow on any other person
that lady was most unluckily to dine this very day with her aunt western and in the afternoon they were all three by appointment to go together to the opera and thence to lady thomas hatchet's drum
sophia would have gladly been excused from all but would not disoblige her aunt and as to the arts of counterfeiting illness she was so entirely a stranger to them that it never once entered into her head
when she was drest therefore down she went resolved to encounter all the horrors of the day and a most disagreeable one it proved for lady bellaston took every opportunity very civilly and slily to insult her to all which her dejection of spirits disabled her from making any return and indeed to confess the truth she was at the very best but an indifferent mistress of repartee
another misfortune which befel poor sophia was the company of lord fellamar whom she met at the opera and who attended her to the drum
and though both places were too publick to admit of any particularities and she was farther relieved by the musick at the one place and by the cards at the other she could not however enjoy herself in his company for there is something of delicacy in women which will not suffer them to be even easy in the presence of a man whom they know to have pretensions to them which they are disinclined to favour
having in this chapter twice mentioned a drum a word which our posterity it is hoped will not understand in the sense it is here applied we shall notwithstanding our present haste stop a moment to describe the entertainment here meant and the rather as we can in a moment describe it
a drum then is an assembly of welldressed persons of both sexes most of whom play at cards and the rest do nothing at all while the mistress of the house performs the part of the landlady at an inn and like the landlady of an inn prides herself in the number of her guests though she doth not always like her get anything by it
no wonder then as so much spirits must be required to support any vivacity in these scenes of dulness that we hear persons of fashion eternally complaining of the want of them a complaint confined entirely to upper life
how insupportable must we imagine this round of impertinence to have been to sophia at this time how difficult must she have found it to force the appearance of gaiety into her looks when her mind dictated nothing but the tenderest sorrow and when every thought was charged with tormenting ideas
night however at last restored her to her pillow where we will leave her to soothe her melancholy at least though incapable we fear of rest and shall pursue our history which something whispers us is now arrived at the eve of some great event
chapter vii
a pathetic scene between mr allworthy and mrs miller
mrs miller had a long discourse with mr allworthy at his return from dinner in which she acquainted him with jones's having unfortunately lost all which he was pleased to bestow on him at their separation and with the distresses to which that loss had subjected him of all which she had received a full account from the faithful retailer partridge
she then explained the obligations she had to jones not that she was entirely explicit with regard to her daughter for though she had the utmost confidence in mr allworthy and though there could be no hopes of keeping an affair secret which was unhappily known to more than half a dozen yet she could not prevail with herself to mention those circumstances which reflected most on the chastity of poor nancy but smothered that part of her evidence as cautiously as if she had been before a judge and the girl was now on her trial for the murder of a bastard
allworthy said there were few characters so absolutely vicious as not to have the least mixture of good in them
however says he i cannot deny but that you have some obligations to the fellow bad as he is and i shall therefore excuse what hath past already but must insist you never mention his name to me more for i promise you it was upon the fullest and plainest evidence that i resolved to take the measures i have taken well sir says she i make not the least doubt but time will shew all matters in their true and natural colours and that you will be convinced this poor young man deserves better of you than some other folks that shall be nameless  madam cries allworthy a little ruffled i will not hear any reflections on my nephew and if ever you say a word more of that kind i will depart from your house that instant
he is the worthiest and best of men and i once more repeat it to you he hath carried his friendship to this man to a blameable length by too long concealing facts of the blackest die
the ingratitude of the wretch to this good young man is what i most resent for madam i have the greatest reason to imagine he had laid a plot to supplant my nephew in my favour and to have disinherited him  i am sure sir answered mrs miller a little frightened for though mr allworthy had the utmost sweetness and benevolence in his smiles he had great terror in his frowns i shall never speak against any gentleman you are pleased to think well of
i am sure sir such behaviour would very little become me especially when the gentleman is your nearest relation but sir you must not be angry with me you must not indeed for my good wishes to this poor wretch
sure i may call him so now though once you would have been angry with me if i had spoke of him with the least disrespect
how often have i heard you call him your son
how often have you prattled to me of him with all the fondness of a parent
nay sir i cannot forget the many tender expressions the many good things you have told me of his beauty and his parts and his virtues of his goodnature and generosity
i am sure sir i cannot forget them for i find them all true
i have experienced them in my own cause
they have preserved my family
you must pardon my tears sir indeed you must
when i consider the cruel reverse of fortune which this poor youth to whom i am so much obliged hath suffered when i consider the loss of your favour which i know he valued more than his life i must i must lament him
if you had a dagger in your hand ready to plunge into my heart i must lament the misery of one whom you have loved and i shall ever love  allworthy was pretty much moved with this speech but it seemed not to be with anger for after a short silence taking mrs miller by the hand he said very affectionately to her come madam let us consider a little about your daughter
i cannot blame you for rejoicing in a match which promises to be advantageous to her but you know this advantage in a great measure depends on the father's reconciliation
i know mr nightingale very well and have formerly had concerns with him i will make him a visit and endeavour to serve you in this matter
i believe he is a worldly man but as this is an only son and the thing is now irretrievable perhaps he may in time be brought to reason
i promise you i will do all i can for you  many were the acknowledgments which the poor woman made to allworthy for this kind and generous offer nor could she refrain from taking this occasion again to express her gratitude towards jones to whom  said she i owe the opportunity of giving you sir this present trouble allworthy gently stopped her but he was too good a man to be really offended with the effects of so noble a principle as now actuated mrs miller and indeed had not this new affair inflamed his former anger against jones it is possible he might have been a little softened towards him by the report of an action which malice itself could not have derived from an evil motive
mr allworthy and mrs miller had been above an hour together when their conversation was put an end to by the arrival of blifil and another person which other person was no less than mr dowling the attorney who was now become a great favourite with mr blifil and whom mr allworthy at the desire of his nephew had made his steward and had likewise recommended him to mr western from whom the attorney received a promise of being promoted to the same office upon the first vacancy and in the meantime was employed in transacting some affairs which the squire then had in london in relation to a mortgage
this was the principal affair which then brought mr dowling to town therefore he took the same opportunity to charge himself with some money for mr allworthy and to make a report to him of some other business in all which as it was of much too dull a nature to find any place in this history we will leave the uncle nephew and their lawyer concerned and resort to other matters
chapter viii
containing various matters
before we return to mr jones we will take one more view of sophia
though that young lady had brought her aunt into great good humour by those soothing methods which we have before related she had not brought her in the least to abate of her zeal for the match with lord fellamar
this zeal was now inflamed by lady bellaston who had told her the preceding evening that she was well satisfied from the conduct of sophia and from her carriage to his lordship that all delays would be dangerous and that the only way to succeed was to press the match forward with such rapidity that the young lady should have no time to reflect and be obliged to consent while she scarce knew what she did in which manner she said onehalf of the marriages among people of condition were brought about
a fact very probably true and to which i suppose is owing the mutual tenderness which afterwards exists among so many happy couples
a hint of the same kind was given by the same lady to lord fellamar and both these so readily embraced the advice that the very next day was at his lordship's request appointed by mrs western for a private interview between the young parties
this was communicated to sophia by her aunt and insisted upon in such high terms that after having urged everything she possibly could invent against it without the least effect she at last agreed to give the highest instance of complacence which any young lady can give and consented to see his lordship
as conversations of this kind afford no great entertainment we shall be excused from reciting the whole that past at this interview in which after his lordship had made many declarations of the most pure and ardent passion to the silent blushing sophia she at last collected all the spirits she could raise and with a trembling low voice said my lord you must be yourself conscious whether your former behaviour to me hath been consistent with the professions you now make is there answered he no way by which i can atone for madness
what i did i am afraid must have too plainly convinced you that the violence of love had deprived me of my senses indeed my lord said she it is in your power to give me a proof of an affection which i much rather wish to encourage and to which i should think myself more beholden name it madam said my lord very warmly
my lord says she looking down upon her fan i know you must be sensible how uneasy this pretended passion of yours hath made me can you be so cruel to call it pretended says he
yes my lord answered sophia all professions of love to those whom we persecute are most insulting pretences
this pursuit of yours is to me a most cruel persecution nay it is taking a most ungenerous advantage of my unhappy situation most lovely most adorable charmer do not accuse me cries he of taking an ungenerous advantage while i have no thoughts but what are directed to your honour and interest and while i have no view no hope no ambition but to throw myself honour fortune everything at your feet my lord says she it is that fortune and those honours which gave you the advantage of which i complain
these are the charms which have seduced my relations but to me they are things indifferent
if your lordship will merit my gratitude there is but one way pardon me divine creature said he there can be none
all i can do for you is so much your due and will give me so much pleasure that there is no room for your gratitude indeed my lord answered she you may obtain my gratitude my good opinion every kind thought and wish which it is in my power to bestow nay you may obtain them with ease for sure to a generous mind it must be easy to grant my request
let me beseech you then to cease a pursuit in which you can never have any success
for your own sake as well as mine i entreat this favour for sure you are too noble to have any pleasure in tormenting an unhappy creature
what can your lordship propose but uneasiness to yourself by a perseverance which upon my honour upon my soul cannot shall not prevail with me whatever distresses you may drive me to here my lord fetched a deep sigh and then saidis it then madam that i am so unhappy to be the object of your dislike and scorn or will you pardon me if i suspect there is some other here he hesitated and sophia answered with some spirit my lord i shall not be accountable to you for the reasons of my conduct
i am obliged to your lordship for the generous offer you have made i own it is beyond either my deserts or expectations yet i hope my lord you will not insist on my reasons when i declare i cannot accept it  lord fellamar returned much to this which we do not perfectly understand and perhaps it could not all be strictly reconciled either to sense or grammar but he concluded his ranting speech with saying that if she had preengaged herself to any gentleman however unhappy it would make him he should think himself bound in honour to desist  perhaps my lord laid too much emphasis on the word gentleman for we cannot else well account for the indignation with which he inspired sophia who in her answer seemed greatly to resent some affront he had given her
while she was speaking with her voice more raised than usual mrs western came into the room the fire glaring in her cheeks and the flames bursting from her eyes
i am ashamed says she my lord of the reception which you have met with
i assure your lordship we are all sensible of the honour done us and i must tell you miss western the family expect a different behaviour from you here my lord interfered on behalf of the young lady but to no purpose the aunt proceeded till sophia pulled out her handkerchief threw herself into a chair and burst into a violent fit of tears
the remainder of the conversation between mrs western and his lordship till the latter withdrew consisted of bitter lamentations on his side and on hers of the strongest assurances that her niece should and would consent to all he wished
indeed my lord says she the girl hath had a foolish education neither adapted to her fortune nor her family
her father i am sorry to say it is to blame for everything
the girl hath silly country notions of bashfulness
nothing else my lord upon my honour i am convinced she hath a good understanding at the bottom and will be brought to reason  this last speech was made in the absence of sophia for she had some time before left the room with more appearance of passion than she had ever shown on any occasion and now his lordship after many expressions of thanks to mrs western many ardent professions of passion which nothing could conquer and many assurances of perseverance which mrs western highly encouraged took his leave for this time
before we relate what now passed between mrs western and sophia it may be proper to mention an unfortunate accident which had happened and which had occasioned the return of mrs western with so much fury as we have seen
the reader then must know that the maid who at present attended on sophia was recommended by lady bellaston with whom she had lived for some time in the capacity of a combbrush she was a very sensible girl and had received the strictest instructions to watch her young lady very carefully
these instructions we are sorry to say were communicated to her by mrs honour into whose favour lady bellaston had now so ingratiated herself that the violent affection which the good waitingwoman had formerly borne to sophia was entirely obliterated by that great attachment which she had to her new mistress
now when mrs miller was departed betty for that was the name of the girl returning to her young lady found her very attentively engaged in reading a long letter and the visible emotions which she betrayed on that occasion might have well accounted for some suspicions which the girl entertained but indeed they had yet a stronger foundation for she had overheard the whole scene which passed between sophia and mrs miller
mrs western was acquainted with all this matter by betty who after receiving many commendations and some rewards for her fidelity was ordered that if the woman who brought the letter came again she should introduce her to mrs western herself
unluckily mrs miller returned at the very time when sophia was engaged with his lordship
betty according to order sent her directly to the aunt who being mistress of so many circumstances relating to what had past the day before easily imposed upon the poor woman to believe that sophia had communicated the whole affair and so pumped everything out of her which she knew relating to the letter and relating to jones
this poor creature might indeed be called simplicity itself
she was one of that order of mortals who are apt to believe everything which is said to them to whom nature hath neither indulged the offensive nor defensive weapons of deceit and who are consequently liable to be imposed upon by any one who will only be at the expense of a little falshood for that purpose
mrs western having drained mrs miller of all she knew which indeed was but little but which was sufficient to make the aunt suspect a great deal dismissed her with assurances that sophia would not see her that she would send no answer to the letter nor ever receive another nor did she suffer her to depart without a handsome lecture on the merits of an office to which she could afford no better name than that of procuressthis discovery had greatly discomposed her temper when coming into the apartment next to that in which the lovers were she overheard sophia very warmly protesting against his lordship's addresses
at which the rage already kindled burst forth and she rushed in upon her niece in a most furious manner as we have already described together with what past at that time till his lordship's departure
no sooner was lord fellamar gone than mrs western returned to sophia whom she upbraided in the most bitter terms for the ill use she had made of the confidence reposed in her and for her treachery in conversing with a man with whom she had offered but the day before to bind herself in the most solemn oath never more to have any conversation
sophia protested she had maintained no such conversation
how how
miss western said the aunt will you deny your receiving a letter from him yesterday a letter madam  answered sophia somewhat surprized
it is not very well bred miss  replies the aunt to repeat my words
i say a letter and i insist upon your showing it me immediately i scorn a lie madam said sophia i did receive a letter but it was without my desire and indeed i may say against my consent indeed indeed miss cries the aunt you ought to be ashamed of owning you had received it at all but where is the letter
for i will see it  to this peremptory demand sophia paused some time before she returned an answer and at last only excused herself by declaring she had not the letter in her pocket which was indeed true upon which her aunt losing all manner of patience asked her niece this short question whether she would resolve to marry lord fellamar or no
to which she received the strongest negative
mrs western then replied with an oath or something very like one that she would early the next morning deliver her back into her father's hand
sophia then began to reason with her aunt in the following mannerwhy madam must i of necessity be forced to marry at all
consider how cruel you would have thought it in your own case and how much kinder your parents were in leaving you to your liberty
what have i done to forfeit this liberty
i will never marry contrary to my father's consent nor without asking yoursand when i ask the consent of either improperly it will be then time enough to force some other marriage upon me can i bear to hear this cries mrs western from a girl who hath now a letter from a murderer in her pocket i have no such letter i promise you answered sophia and if he be a murderer he will soon be in no condition to give you any further disturbance how miss western said the aunt have you the assurance to speak of him in this manner to own your affection for such a villain to my face sure madam said sophia you put a very strange construction on my words indeed miss western cries the lady i shall not bear this usage you have learnt of your father this manner of treating me he hath taught you to give me the lie
he hath totally ruined you by this false system of education and please heaven he shall have the comfort of its fruits for once more i declare to you that tomorrow morning i will carry you back
i will withdraw all my forces from the field and remain henceforth like the wise king of prussia in a state of perfect neutrality
you are both too wise to be regulated by my measures so prepare yourself for tomorrow morning you shall evacuate this house  sophia remonstrated all she could but her aunt was deaf to all she said
in this resolution therefore we must at present leave her as there seems to be no hopes of bringing her to change it
chapter ix
what happened to mr jones in the prison
mr jones passed about twentyfour melancholy hours by himself unless when relieved by the company of partridge before mr nightingale returned not that this worthy young man had deserted or forgot his friend for indeed he had been much the greatest part of the time employed in his service
he had heard upon enquiry that the only persons who had seen the beginning of the unfortunate rencounter were a crew belonging to a manofwar which then lay at deptford
to deptford therefore he went in search of this crew where he was informed that the men he sought after were all gone ashore
he then traced them from place to place till at last he found two of them drinking together with a third person at a hedgetavern near aldersgate
nightingale desired to speak with jones by himself for partridge was in the room when he came in
as soon as they were alone nightingale taking jones by the hand cried come my brave friend be not too much dejected at what i am going to tell youi am sorry i am the messenger of bad news but i think it my duty to tell you i guess already what that bad news is cries jones
the poor gentleman then is deadi hope not answered nightingale
he was alive this morning though i will not flatter you i fear from the accounts i could get that his wound is mortal
but if the affair be exactly as you told it your own remorse would be all you would have reason to apprehend let what would happen but forgive me my dear tom if i entreat you to make the worst of your story to your friends
if you disguise anything to us you will only be an enemy to yourself  what reason my dear jack have i ever given you said jones to stab me with so cruel a suspicion have patience cries nightingale and i will tell you all
after the most diligent enquiry i could make i at last met with two of the fellows who were present at this unhappy accident and i am sorry to say they do not relate the story so much in your favour as you yourself have told it why what do they say cries jones
indeed what i am sorry to repeat as i am afraid of the consequence of it to you
they say that they were at too great a distance to overhear any words that passed between you but they both agree that the first blow was given by you then upon my soul answered jones they injure me
he not only struck me first but struck me without the least provocation
what should induce those villains to accuse me falsely nay that i cannot guess said nightingale and if you yourself and i who am so heartily your friend cannot conceive a reason why they should belie you what reason will an indifferent court of justice be able to assign why they should not believe them
i repeated the question to them several times and so did another gentleman who was present who i believe is a seafaring man and who really acted a very friendly part by you for he begged them often to consider that there was the life of a man in the case and asked them over and over if they were certain to which they both answered that they were and would abide by their evidence upon oath
for heaven's sake my dear friend recollect yourself for if this should appear to be the fact it will be your business to think in time of making the best of your interest
i would not shock you but you know i believe the severity of the law whatever verbal provocations may have been given you alas
my friend cries jones what interest hath such a wretch as i
besides do you think i would even wish to live with the reputation of a murderer
if i had any friends as alas
i have none could i have the confidence to solicit them to speak in the behalf of a man condemned for the blackest crime in human nature
believe me i have no such hope but i have some reliance on a throne still greatly superior which will i am certain afford me all the protection i merit  he then concluded with many solemn and vehement protestations of the truth of what he had at first asserted
the faith of nightingale was now again staggered and began to incline to credit his friend when mrs miller appeared and made a sorrowful report of the success of her embassy which when jones had heard he cried out most heroically well my friend i am now indifferent as to what shall happen at least with regard to my life and if it be the will of heaven that i shall make an atonement with that for the blood i have spilt i hope the divine goodness will one day suffer my honour to be cleared and that the words of a dying man at least will be believed so far as to justify his character  a very mournful scene now past between the prisoner and his friends at which as few readers would have been pleased to be present so few i believe will desire to hear it particularly related
we will therefore pass on to the entrance of the turnkey who acquainted jones that there was a lady without who desired to speak with him when he was at leisure
jones declared his surprize at this message
he said he knew no lady in the world whom he could possibly expect to see there however as he saw no reason to decline seeing any person mrs miller and mr nightingale presently took their leave and he gave orders to have the lady admitted
if jones was surprized at the news of a visit from a lady how greatly was he astonished when he discovered this lady to be no other than mrs waters
in this astonishment then we shall leave him awhile in order to cure the surprize of the reader who will likewise probably not a little wonder at the arrival of this lady
who this mrs waters was the reader pretty well knows what she was he must be perfectly satisfied
he will therefore be pleased to remember that this lady departed from upton in the same coach with mr fitzpatrick and the other irish gentleman and in their company travelled to bath
now there was a certain office in the gift of mr fitzpatrick at that time vacant namely that of a wife for the lady who had lately filled that office had resigned or at least deserted her duty
mr fitzpatrick therefore having thoroughly examined mrs waters on the road found her extremely fit for the place which on their arrival at bath he presently conferred upon her and she without any scruple accepted
as husband and wife this gentleman and lady continued together all the time they stayed at bath and as husband and wife they arrived together in town
whether mr fitzpatrick was so wise a man as not to part with one good thing till he had secured another which he had at present only a prospect of regaining or whether mrs waters had so well discharged her office that he intended still to retain her as principal and to make his wife as is often the case only her deputy i will not say but certain it is he never mentioned his wife to her never communicated to her the letter given him by mrs western nor ever once hinted his purpose of repossessing his wife much less did he ever mention the name of jones
for though he intended to fight with him wherever he met him he did not imitate those prudent persons who think a wife a mother a sister or sometimes a whole family the safest seconds on these occasions
the first account therefore which she had of all this was delivered to her from his lips after he was brought home from the tavern where his wound had been drest
as mr fitzpatrick however had not the clearest way of telling a story at any time and was now perhaps a little more confused than usual it was some time before she discovered that the gentleman who had given him this wound was the very same person from whom her heart had received a wound which though not of a mortal kind was yet so deep that it had left a considerable scar behind it
but no sooner was she acquainted that mr jones himself was the man who had been committed to the gatehouse for this supposed murder than she took the first opportunity of committing mr fitzpatrick to the care of his nurse and hastened away to visit the conqueror
she now entered the room with an air of gaiety which received an immediate check from the melancholy aspect of poor jones who started and blessed himself when he saw her
upon which she said nay i do not wonder at your surprize i believe you did not expect to see me for few gentlemen are troubled here with visits from any lady unless a wife
you see the power you have over me mr jones
indeed i little thought when we parted at upton that our next meeting would have been in such a place indeed madam says jones i must look upon this visit as kind few will follow the miserable especially to such dismal habitations i protest mr jones says she i can hardly persuade myself you are the same agreeable fellow i saw at upton
why your face is more miserable than any dungeon in the universe
what can be the matter with you i thought madam said jones as you knew of my being here you knew the unhappy reason pugh says she you have pinked a man in a duel that's all jones exprest some indignation at this levity and spoke with the utmost contrition for what had happened
to which she answered well then sir if you take it so much to heart i will relieve you the gentleman is not dead and i am pretty confident is in no danger of dying
the surgeon indeed who first dressed him was a young fellow and seemed desirous of representing his case to be as bad as possible that he might have the more honour from curing him but the king's surgeon hath seen him since and says unless from a fever of which there are at present no symptoms he apprehends not the least danger of life  jones shewed great satisfaction in his countenance at this report upon which she affirmed the truth of it adding by the most extraordinary accident in the world i lodge at the same house and have seen the gentleman and i promise you he doth you justice and says whatever be the consequence that he was entirely the aggressor and that you was not in the least to blame  jones expressed the utmost satisfaction at the account which mrs waters brought him
he then informed her of many things which she well knew before as who mr fitzpatrick was the occasion of his resentment c he likewise told her several facts of which she was ignorant as the adventure of the muff and other particulars concealing only the name of sophia
he then lamented the follies and vices of which he had been guilty every one of which he said had been attended with such ill consequences that he should be unpardonable if he did not take warning and quit those vicious courses for the future
he lastly concluded with assuring her of his resolution to sin no more lest a worse thing should happen to him
mrs waters with great pleasantry ridiculed all this as the effects of low spirits and confinement
she repeated some witticisms about the devil when he was sick and told him she doubted not but shortly to see him at liberty and as lively a fellow as ever and then says she i don't question but your conscience will be safely delivered of all these qualms that it is now so sick in breeding  many more things of this kind she uttered some of which it would do her no great honour in the opinion of some readers to remember nor are we quite certain but that the answers made by jones would be treated with ridicule by others
we shall therefore suppress the rest of this conversation and only observe that it ended at last with perfect innocence and much more to the satisfaction of jones than of the lady for the former was greatly transported with the news she had brought him but the latter was not altogether so pleased with the penitential behaviour of a man whom she had at her first interview conceived a very different opinion of from what she now entertained of him
thus the melancholy occasioned by the report of mr nightingale was pretty well effaced but the dejection into which mrs miller had thrown him still continued
the account she gave so well tallied with the words of sophia herself in her letter that he made not the least doubt but that she had disclosed his letter to her aunt and had taken a fixed resolution to abandon him
the torments this thought gave him were to be equalled only by a piece of news which fortune had yet in store for him and which we shall communicate in the second chapter of the ensuing book
book xviii
containing about six days
chapter i
a farewel to the reader
we are now reader arrived at the last stage of our long journey
as we have therefore travelled together through so many pages let us behave to one another like fellowtravellers in a stage coach who have passed several days in the company of each other and who notwithstanding any bickerings or little animosities which may have occurred on the road generally make all up at last and mount for the last time into their vehicle with chearfulness and good humour since after this one stage it may possibly happen to us as it commonly happens to them never to meet more
as i have here taken up this simile give me leave to carry it a little farther
i intend then in this last book to imitate the good company i have mentioned in their last journey
now it is well known that all jokes and raillery are at this time laid aside whatever characters any of the passengers have for the jestsake personated on the road are now thrown off and the conversation is usually plain and serious
in the same manner if i have now and then in the course of this work indulged any pleasantry for thy entertainment i shall here lay it down
the variety of matter indeed which i shall be obliged to cram into this book will afford no room for any of those ludicrous observations which i have elsewhere made and which may sometimes perhaps have prevented thee from taking a nap when it was beginning to steal upon thee
in this last book thou wilt find nothing or at most very little of that nature
all will be plain narrative only and indeed when thou hast perused the many great events which this book will produce thou wilt think the number of pages contained in it scarce sufficient to tell the story
and now my friend i take this opportunity as i shall have no other of heartily wishing thee well
if i have been an entertaining companion to thee i promise thee it is what i have desired
if in anything i have offended it was really without any intention
some things perhaps here said may have hit thee or thy friends but i do most solemnly declare they were not pointed at thee or them
i question not but thou hast been told among other stories of me that thou wast to travel with a very scurrilous fellow but whoever told thee so did me an injury
no man detests and despises scurrility more than myself nor hath any man more reason for none hath ever been treated with more and what is a very severe fate i have had some of the abusive writings of those very men fathered upon me who in other of their works have abused me themselves with the utmost virulence
all these works however i am well convinced will be dead long before this page shall offer itself to thy perusal for however short the period may be of my own performances they will most probably outlive their own infirm author and the weakly productions of his abusive contemporaries
chapter ii
containing a very tragical incident
while jones was employed in those unpleasant meditations with which we left him tormenting himself partridge came stumbling into the room with his face paler than ashes his eyes fixed in his head his hair standing an end and every limb trembling
in short he looked as he would have done had he seen a spectre or had he indeed been a spectre himself
jones who was little subject to fear could not avoid being somewhat shocked at this sudden appearance
he did indeed himself change colour and his voice a little faultered while he asked him what was the matter
i hope sir said partridge you will not be angry with me
indeed i did not listen but i was obliged to stay in the outward room
i am sure i wish i had been a hundred miles off rather than have heard what i have heard why what is the matter said jones
the matter sir
o good heaven answered partridge was that woman who is just gone out the woman who was with you at upton she was partridge cried jones
and did you really sir go to bed with that woman said he tremblingi am afraid what past between us is no secret said jonesnay but pray sir for heaven's sake sir answer me cries partridge
you know i did cries jones
why then the lord have mercy upon your soul and forgive you cries partridge but as sure as i stand here alive you have been abed with your own mother  upon these words jones became in a moment a greater picture of horror than partridge himself
he was indeed for some time struck dumb with amazement and both stood staring wildly at each other
at last his words found way and in an interrupted voice he said how
how
what's this you tell me nay sir cries partridge i have not breath enough left to tell you now but what i have said is most certainly truethat woman who now went out is your own mother
how unlucky was it for you sir that i did not happen to see her at that time to have prevented it
sure the devil himself must have contrived to bring about this wickedness  sure cries jones fortune will never have done with me till she hath driven me to distraction
but why do i blame fortune
i am myself the cause of all my misery
all the dreadful mischiefs which have befallen me are the consequences only of my own folly and vice
what thou hast told me partridge hath almost deprived me of my senses
and was mrs waters thenbut why do i ask
for thou must certainly know herif thou hast any affection for me nay if thou hast any pity let me beseech thee to fetch this miserable woman back again to me
o good heavens
incestwith a mother
to what am i reserved  he then fell into the most violent and frantic agonies of grief and despair in which partridge declared he would not leave him but at last having vented the first torrent of passion he came a little to himself and then having acquainted partridge that he would find this wretched woman in the same house where the wounded gentleman was lodged he despatched him in quest of her
if the reader will please to refresh his memory by turning to the scene at upton in the ninth book he will be apt to admire the many strange accidents which unfortunately prevented any interview between partridge and mrs waters when she spent a whole day there with mr jones
instances of this kind we may frequently observe in life where the greatest events are produced by a nice train of little circumstances and more than one example of this may be discovered by the accurate eye in this our history
after a fruitless search of two or three hours partridge returned back to his master without having seen mrs waters
jones who was in a state of desperation at his delay was almost raving mad when he brought him his account
he was not long however in this condition before he received the following letter    sir    since i left you i have seen a gentleman from whom i have learned   something concerning you which greatly surprizes and affects me but   as i have not at present leisure to communicate a matter of such   high importance you must suspend your curiosity till our next   meeting which shall be the first moment i am able to see you
o mr   jones little did i think when i past that happy day at upton the   reflection upon which is like to embitter all my future life who it   was to whom i owed such perfect happiness
believe me to be ever   sincerely your unfortunate                                       j
waters    ps
i would have you comfort yourself as much as possible for mr   fitzpatrick is in no manner of danger so that whatever other   grievous crimes you may have to repent of the guilt of blood is not   among the number  jones having read the letter let it drop for he was unable to hold it and indeed had scarce the use of any one of his faculties
partridge took it up and having received consent by silence read it likewise nor had it upon him a less sensible effect
the pencil and not the pen should describe the horrors which appeared in both their countenances
while they both remained speechless the turnkey entered the room and without taking any notice of what sufficiently discovered itself in the faces of them both acquainted jones that a man without desired to speak with him
this person was presently introduced and was no other than black george
as sights of horror were not so usual to george as they were to the turnkey he instantly saw the great disorder which appeared in the face of jones
this he imputed to the accident that had happened which was reported in the very worst light in mr western's family he concluded therefore that the gentleman was dead and that mr jones was in a fair way of coming to a shameful end
a thought which gave him much uneasiness for george was of a compassionate disposition and notwithstanding a small breach of friendship which he had been overtempted to commit was in the main not insensible of the obligations he had formerly received from mr jones
the poor fellow therefore scarce refrained from a tear at the present sight
he told jones he was heartily sorry for his misfortunes and begged him to consider if he could be of any manner of service
perhaps sir said he you may want a little matter of money upon this occasion if you do sir what little i have is heartily at your service  jones shook him very heartily by the hand and gave him many thanks for the kind offer he had made but answered he had not the least want of that kind upon which george began to press his services more eagerly than before
jones again thanked him with assurances that he wanted nothing which was in the power of any man living to give
come come my good master answered george do not take the matter so much to heart
things may end better than you imagine to be sure you an't the first gentleman who hath killed a man and yet come off  you are wide of the matter george said partridge the gentleman is not dead nor like to die
don't disturb my master at present for he is troubled about a matter in which it is not in your power to do him any good you don't know what i may be able to do mr partridge answered george if his concern is about my young lady i have some news to tell my master what do you say mr george cried jones
hath anything lately happened in which my sophia is concerned
my sophia
how dares such a wretch as i mention her so profanely i hope she will be yours yet answered george
why yes sir i have something to tell you about her
madam western hath just brought madam sophia home and there hath been a terrible to do
i could not possibly learn the very right of it but my master he hath been in a vast big passion and so was madam western and i heard her say as she went out of doors into her chair that she would never set her foot in master's house again
i don't know what's the matter not i but everything was very quiet when i came out but robin who waited at supper said he had never seen the squire for a long while in such good humour with young madam that he kissed her several times and swore she should be her own mistress and he never would think of confining her any more
i thought this news would please you and so i slipped out though it was so late to inform you of it mr jones assured george that it did greatly please him for though he should never more presume to lift his eyes toward that incomparable creature nothing could so much relieve his misery as the satisfaction he should always have in hearing of her welfare
the rest of the conversation which passed at the visit is not important enough to be here related
the reader will therefore forgive us this abrupt breaking off and be pleased to hear how this great goodwill of the squire towards his daughter was brought about
mrs western on her first arrival at her brother's lodging began to set forth the great honours and advantages which would accrue to the family by the match with lord fellamar which her niece had absolutely refused in which refusal when the squire took the part of his daughter she fell immediately into the most violent passion and so irritated and provoked the squire that neither his patience nor his prudence could bear it any longer upon which there ensued between them both so warm a bout at altercation that perhaps the regions of billingsgate never equalled it
in the heat of this scolding mrs western departed and had consequently no leisure to acquaint her brother with the letter which sophia received which might have possibly produced ill effects but to say truth i believe it never once occurred to her memory at this time
when mrs western was gone sophia who had been hitherto silent as well indeed from necessity as inclination began to return the compliment which her father had made her in taking her part against her aunt by taking his likewise against the lady
this was the first time of her so doing and it was in the highest degree acceptable to the squire
again he remembered that mr allworthy had insisted on an entire relinquishment of all violent means and indeed as he made no doubt but that jones would be hanged he did not in the least question succeeding with his daughter by fair means he now therefore once more gave a loose to his natural fondness for her which had such an effect on the dutiful grateful tender and affectionate heart of sophia that had her honour given to jones and something else perhaps in which he was concerned been removed i much doubt whether she would not have sacrificed herself to a man she did not like to have obliged her father
she promised him she would make it the whole business of her life to oblige him and would never marry any man against his consent which brought the old man so near to his highest happiness that he was resolved to take the other step and went to bed completely drunk
chapter iii
allworthy visits old nightingale with a strange discovery that he made on that occasion
the morning after these things had happened mr allworthy went according to his promise to visit old nightingale with whom his authority was so great that after having sat with him three hours he at last prevailed with him to consent to see his son
here an accident happened of a very extraordinary kind one indeed of those strange chances whence very good and grave men have concluded that providence often interposes in the discovery of the most secret villany in order to caution men from quitting the paths of honesty however warily they tread in those of vice
mr allworthy at his entrance into mr nightingale's saw black george he took no notice of him nor did black george imagine he had perceived him
however when their conversation on the principal point was over allworthy asked nightingale whether he knew one george seagrim and upon what business he came to his house
yes answered nightingale i know him very well and a most extraordinary fellow he is who in these days hath been able to hoard up  from renting a very small estate of  a year and is this the story which he hath told you  cries allworthy
nay it is true i promise you said nightingale for i have the money now in my own hands in five bankbills which i am to lay out either in a mortgage or in some purchase in the north of england the bankbills were no sooner produced at allworthy's desire than he blessed himself at the strangeness of the discovery
he presently told nightingale that these bankbills were formerly his and then acquainted him with the whole affair
as there are no men who complain more of the frauds of business than highwaymen gamesters and other thieves of that kind so there are none who so bitterly exclaim against the frauds of gamesters c as usurers brokers and other thieves of this kind whether it be that the one way of cheating is a discountenance or reflection upon the other or that money which is the common mistress of all cheats makes them regard each other in the light of rivals but nightingale no sooner heard the story than he exclaimed against the fellow in terms much severer than the justice and honesty of allworthy had bestowed on him
allworthy desired nightingale to retain both the money and the secret till he should hear farther from him and if he should in the meantime see the fellow that he would not take the least notice to him of the discovery which he had made
he then returned to his lodgings where he found mrs miller in a very dejected condition on account of the information she had received from her soninlaw
mr allworthy with great chearfulness told her that he had much good news to communicate and with little further preface acquainted her that he had brought mr nightingale to consent to see his son and did not in the least doubt to effect a perfect reconciliation between them though he found the father more sowered by another accident of the same kind which had happened in his family
he then mentioned the running away of the uncle's daughter which he had been told by the old gentleman and which mrs miller and her soninlaw did not yet know
the reader may suppose mrs miller received this account with great thankfulness and no less pleasure but so uncommon was her friendship to jones that i am not certain whether the uneasiness she suffered for his sake did not overbalance her satisfaction at hearing a piece of news tending so much to the happiness of her own family nor whether even this very news as it reminded her of the obligations she had to jones did not hurt as well as please her when her grateful heart said to her while my own family is happy how miserable is the poor creature to whose generosity we owe the beginning of all this happiness  allworthy having left her a little while to chew the cud if i may use that expression on these first tidings told her he had still something more to impart which he believed would give her pleasure
i think said he i have discovered a pretty considerable treasure belonging to the young gentleman your friend but perhaps indeed his present situation may be such that it will be of no service to him the latter part of the speech gave mrs miller to understand who was meant and she answered with a sigh i hope not sir i hope so too cries allworthy with all my heart but my nephew told me this morning he had heard a very bad account of the affairgood heaven
sir said shewell i must not speak and yet it is certainly very hard to be obliged to hold one's tongue when one hearsmadam said allworthy you may say whatever you please you know me too well to think i have a prejudice against any one and as for that young man i assure you i should be heartily pleased to find he could acquit himself of everything and particularly of this sad affair
you can testify the affection i have formerly borne him
the world i know censured me for loving him so much
i did not withdraw that affection from him without thinking i had the justest cause
believe me mrs miller i should be glad to find i have been mistaken mrs miller was going eagerly to reply when a servant acquainted her that a gentleman without desired to speak with her immediately
allworthy then enquired for his nephew and was told that he had been for some time in his room with the gentleman who used to come to him and whom mr allworthy guessing rightly to be mr dowling he desired presently to speak with him
when dowling attended allworthy put the case of the banknotes to him without mentioning any name and asked in what manner such a person might be punished
to which dowling answered he thought he might be indicted on the black act but said as it was a matter of some nicety it would be proper to go to counsel
he said he was to attend counsel presently upon an affair of mr western's and if mr allworthy pleased he would lay the case before them this was agreed to and then mrs miller opening the door cried i ask pardon i did not know you had company but allworthy desired her to come in saying he had finished his business
upon which mr dowling withdrew and mrs miller introduced mr nightingale the younger to return thanks for the great kindness done him by allworthy but she had scarce patience to let the young gentleman finish his speech before she interrupted him saying o sir
mr nightingale brings great news about poor mr jones he hath been to see the wounded gentleman who is out of all danger of death and what is more declares he fell upon poor mr jones himself and beat him
i am sure sir you would not have mr jones be a coward
if i was a man myself i am sure if any man was to strike me i should draw my sword
do pray my dear tell mr allworthy tell him all yourself nightingale then confirmed what mrs miller had said and concluded with many handsome things of jones who was he said one of the bestnatured fellows in the world and not in the least inclined to be quarrelsome
here nightingale was going to cease when mrs miller again begged him to relate all the many dutiful expressions he had heard him make use of towards mr allworthy
to say the utmost good of mr allworthy cries nightingale is doing no more than strict justice and can have no merit in it but indeed i must say no man can be more sensible of the obligations he hath to so good a man than is poor jones
indeed sir i am convinced the weight of your displeasure is the heaviest burthen he lies under
he hath often lamented it to me and hath as often protested in the most solemn manner he hath never been intentionally guilty of any offence towards you nay he hath sworn he would rather die a thousand deaths than he would have his conscience upbraid him with one disrespectful ungrateful or undutiful thought towards you
but i ask pardon sir i am afraid i presume to intermeddle too far in so tender a point you have spoke no more than what a christian ought cries mrs miller
indeed mr nightingale answered allworthy i applaud your generous friendship and i wish he may merit it of you
i confess i am glad to hear the report you bring from this unfortunate gentleman and if that matter should turn out to be as you represent it and indeed i doubt nothing of what you say i may perhaps in time be brought to think better than lately i have of this young man for this good gentlewoman here nay all who know me can witness that i loved him as dearly as if he had been my own son
indeed i have considered him as a child sent by fortune to my care
i still remember the innocent the helpless situation in which i found him
i feel the tender pressure of his little hands at this moment
he was my darling indeed he was at which words he ceased and the tears stood in his eyes
as the answer which mrs miller made may lead us into fresh matters we will here stop to account for the visible alteration in mr allworthy's mind and the abatement of his anger to jones
revolutions of this kind it is true do frequently occur in histories and dramatic writers for no other reason than because the history or play draws to a conclusion and are justified by authority of authors yet though we insist upon as much authority as any author whatever we shall use this power very sparingly and never but when we are driven to it by necessity which we do not at present foresee will happen in this work
this alteration then in the mind of mr allworthy was occasioned by a letter he had just received from mr square and which we shall give the reader in the beginning of the next chapter
chapter iv
containing two letters in very different stiles
my worthy friendi informed you in my last that i was forbidden   the use of the waters as they were found by experience rather to   increase than lessen the symptoms of my distemper
i must now   acquaint you with a piece of news which i believe will afflict my   friends more than it hath afflicted me
dr harrington and dr   brewster have informed me that there is no hopes of my recovery
i have somewhere read that the great use of philosophy is to learn   to die
i will not therefore so far disgrace mine as to shew any   surprize at receiving a lesson which i must be thought to have so   long studied
yet to say the truth one page of the gospel teaches   this lesson better than all the volumes of antient or modern   philosophers
the assurance it gives us of another life is a much   stronger support to a good mind than all the consolations that are   drawn from the necessity of nature the emptiness or satiety of our   enjoyments here or any other topic of those declamations which are   sometimes capable of arming our minds with a stubborn patience in   bearing the thoughts of death but never of raising them to a real   contempt of it and much less of making us think it is a real good
i would not here be understood to throw the horrid censure of   atheism or even the absolute denial of immortality on all who are   called philosophers
many of that sect as well antient as modern   have from the light of reason discovered some hopes of a future   state but in reality that light was so faint and glimmering and   the hopes were so incertain and precarious that it may be justly   doubted on which side their belief turned
plato himself concludes   his phaedon with declaring that his best arguments amount only to   raise a probability and cicero himself seems rather to profess an   inclination to believe than any actual belief in the doctrines of   immortality
as to myself to be very sincere with you i never was   much in earnest in this faith till i was in earnest a christian
you will perhaps wonder at the latter expression but i assure you   it hath not been till very lately that i could with truth call   myself so
the pride of philosophy had intoxicated my reason and   the sublimest of all wisdom appeared to me as it did to the greeks   of old to be foolishness
god hath however been so gracious to   shew me my error in time and to bring me into the way of truth   before i sunk into utter darkness forever
i find myself beginning to grow weak i shall therefore hasten to   the main purpose of this letter
when i reflect on the actions of my past life i know of nothing   which sits heavier upon my conscience than the injustice i have been   guilty of to that poor wretch your adopted son
i have indeed not   only connived at the villany of others but been myself active in   injustice towards him
believe me my dear friend when i tell you   on the word of a dying man he hath been basely injured
as to the   principal fact upon the misrepresentation of which you discarded   him i solemnly assure you he is innocent
when you lay upon your   supposed deathbed he was the only person in the house who testified   any real concern and what happened afterwards arose from the   wildness of his joy on your recovery and i am sorry to say it   from the baseness of another person but it is my desire to justify   the innocent and to accuse none
believe me my friend this young   man hath the noblest generosity of heart the most perfect capacity   for friendship the highest integrity and indeed every virtue which   can ennoble a man
he hath some faults but among them is not to be   numbered the least want of duty or gratitude towards you
on the   contrary i am satisfied when you dismissed him from your house   his heart bled for you more than for himself
worldly motives were the wicked and base reasons of my concealing   this from you so long to reveal it now i can have no inducement but   the desire of serving the cause of truth of doing right to the   innocent and of making all the amends in my power for a past   offence
i hope this declaration therefore will have the effect   desired and will restore this deserving young man to your favour   the hearing of which while i am yet alive will afford the utmost   consolation to                    sir                      your most obliged                           obedient humble servant                                   thomas square  the reader will after this scarce wonder at the revolution so visibly appearing in mr allworthy notwithstanding he received from thwackum by the same post another letter of a very different kind which we shall here add as it may possibly be the last time we shall have occasion to mention the name of that gentleman
sir    i am not at all surprized at hearing from your worthy nephew a   fresh instance of the villany of mr square the atheist's young   pupil
i shall not wonder at any murders he may commit and i   heartily pray that your own blood may not seal up his final   commitment to the place of wailing and gnashing of teeth
though you cannot want sufficient calls to repentance for the many   unwarrantable weaknesses exemplified in your behaviour to this   wretch so much to the prejudice of your own lawful family and of   your character i say though these may sufficiently be supposed to   prick and goad your conscience at this season i should yet be   wanting to my duty if i spared to give you some admonition in order   to bring you to a due sense of your errors
i therefore pray you   seriously to consider the judgment which is likely to overtake this   wicked villain and let it serve at least as a warning to you that   you may not for the future despise the advice of one who is so   indefatigable in his prayers for your welfare
had not my hand been withheld from due correction i had scourged   much of this diabolical spirit out of a boy of whom from his   infancy i discovered the devil had taken such entire possession
but   reflections of this kind now come too late
i am sorry you have given away the living of westerton so hastily
i should have applied on that occasion earlier had i thought you   would not have acquainted me previous to the dispositionyour   objection to pluralities is being righteous overmuch
if there were   any crime in the practice so many godly men would not agree to it
if the vicar of aldergrove should die as we hear he is in a   declining way i hope you will think of me since i am certain you   must be convinced of my most sincere attachment to your highest   welfarea welfare to which all worldly considerations are as   trifling as the small tithes mentioned in scripture are when   compared to the weighty matters of the law
i am sir                 your faithful humble servant                                 roger thwackum  this was the first time thwackum ever wrote in this authoritative stile to allworthy and of this he had afterwards sufficient reason to repent as in the case of those who mistake the highest degree of goodness for the lowest degree of weakness
allworthy had indeed never liked this man
he knew him to be proud and illnatured he also knew that his divinity itself was tinctured with his temper and such as in many respects he himself did by no means approve but he was at the same time an excellent scholar and most indefatigable in teaching the two lads
add to this the strict severity of his life and manners an unimpeached honesty and a most devout attachment to religion
so that upon the whole though allworthy did not esteem nor love the man yet he could never bring himself to part with a tutor to the boys who was both by learning and industry extremely well qualified for his office and he hoped that as they were bred up in his own house and under his own eye he should be able to correct whatever was wrong in thwackum's instructions
chapter v  in which the history is continued
mr allworthy in his last speech had recollected some tender ideas concerning jones which had brought tears into the good man's eyes
this mrs miller observing said yes yes sir your goodness to this poor young man is known notwithstanding all your care to conceal it but there is not a single syllable of truth in what those villains said
mr nightingale hath now discovered the whole matter
it seems these fellows were employed by a lord who is a rival of poor mr jones to have pressed him on board a shipi assure them i don't know who they will press next
mr nightingale here hath seen the officer himself who is a very pretty gentleman and hath told him all and is very sorry for what he undertook which he would never have done had he known mr jones to have been a gentleman but he was told that he was a common strolling vagabond  allworthy stared at all this and declared he was a stranger to every word she said
yes sir answered she i believe you areit is a very different story i believe from what those fellows told this lawyer  what lawyer madam
what is it you mean said allworthy
nay nay  said she this is so like you to deny your own goodness but mr nightingale here saw him saw whom madam answered he
why your lawyer sir said she that you so kindly sent to enquire into the affair i am still in the dark upon my honour said allworthy
why then do you tell him my dear sir cries she
indeed sir  said nightingale i did see that very lawyer who went from you when i came into the room at an alehouse in aldersgate in company with two of the fellows who were employed by lord fellamar to press mr jones and who were by that means present at the unhappy rencounter between him and mr fitzpatrick i own sir said mrs miller when i saw this gentleman come into the room to you i told mr nightingale that i apprehended you had sent him thither to inquire into the affair  allworthy shewed marks of astonishment in his countenance at this news and was indeed for two or three minutes struck dumb by it
at last addressing himself to mr nightingale he said i must confess myself sir more surprized at what you tell me than i have ever been before at anything in my whole life
are you certain this was the gentleman i am most certain answered nightingale
at aldersgate cries allworthy
and was you in company with this lawyer and the two fellowsi was sir said the other very near half an hour well sir said allworthy and in what manner did the lawyer behave
did you hear all that past between him and the fellows no sir answered nightingale they had been together before i camein my presence the lawyer said little but after i had several times examined the fellows who persisted in a story directly contrary to what i had heard from mr jones and which i find by mr fitzpatrick was a rank falshood the lawyer then desired the fellows to say nothing but what was the truth and seemed to speak so much in favour of mr jones that when i saw the same person with you i concluded your goodness had prompted you to send him thitherand did you not send him thither says mrs millerindeed i did not  answered allworthy nor did i know he had gone on such an errand till this momenti see it all said mrs miller upon my soul i see it all
no wonder they have been closeted so close lately
son nightingale let me beg you run for these fellows immediatelyfind them out if they are aboveground
i will go myselfdear madam  said allworthy be patient and do me the favour to send a servant upstairs to call mr dowling hither if he be in the house or if not mr blifil mrs miller went out muttering something to herself and presently returned with an answer that mr dowling was gone but that the t'other as she called him was coming  allworthy was of a cooler disposition than the good woman whose spirits were all up in arms in the cause of her friend
he was not however without some suspicions which were near akin to hers
when blifil came into the room he asked him with a very serious countenance and with a less friendly look than he had ever before given him whether he knew anything of mr dowling's having seen any of the persons who were present at the duel between jones and another gentleman  there is nothing so dangerous as a question which comes by surprize on a man whose business it is to conceal truth or to defend falshood
for which reason those worthy personages whose noble office it is to save the lives of their fellowcreatures at the old bailey take the utmost care by frequent previous examination to divine every question which may be asked their clients on the day of tryal that they may be supplyed with proper and ready answers which the most fertile invention cannot supply in an instant
besides the sudden and violent impulse on the blood occasioned by these surprizes causes frequently such an alteration in the countenance that the man is obliged to give evidence against himself
and such indeed were the alterations which the countenance of blifil underwent from this sudden question that we can scarce blame the eagerness of mrs miller who immediately cryed out guilty upon my honour
guilty upon my soul  mr allworthy sharply rebuked her for this impetuosity and then turning to blifil who seemed sinking into the earth he said why do you hesitate sir at giving me an answer
you certainly must have employed him for he would not of his own accord i believe have undertaken such an errand and especially without acquainting me  blifil then answered i own sir i have been guilty of an offence yet may i hope your pardonmy pardon said allworthy very angrilynay sir answered blifil i knew you would be offended yet surely my dear uncle will forgive the effects of the most amiable of human weaknesses
compassion for those who do not deserve it i own is a crime and yet it is a crime from which you yourself are not entirely free
i know i have been guilty of it in more than one instance to this very person and i will own i did send mr dowling not on a vain and fruitless enquiry but to discover the witnesses and to endeavour to soften their evidence
this sir is the truth which though i intended to conceal from you i will not deny  i confess said nightingale this is the light in which it appeared to me from the gentleman's behaviour  now madam said allworthy i believe you will once in your life own you have entertained a wrong suspicion and are not so angry with my nephew as you was  mrs miller was silent for though she could not so hastily be pleased with blifil whom she looked upon to have been the ruin of jones yet in this particular instance he had imposed upon her as well as upon the rest so entirely had the devil stood his friend
and indeed i look upon the vulgar observation that the devil often deserts his friends and leaves them in the lurch to be a great abuse on that gentleman's character
perhaps he may sometimes desert those who are only his cup acquaintance or who at most are but half his but he generally stands by those who are thoroughly his servants and helps them off in all extremities till their bargain expires
as a conquered rebellion strengthens a government or as health is more perfectly established by recovery from some diseases so anger when removed often gives new life to affection
this was the case of mr allworthy for blifil having wiped off the greater suspicion the lesser which had been raised by square's letter sunk of course and was forgotten and thwackum with whom he was greatly offended bore alone all the reflections which square had cast on the enemies of jones
as for that young man the resentment of mr allworthy began more and more to abate towards him
he told blifil he did not only forgive the extraordinary efforts of his goodnature but would give him the pleasure of following his example then turning to mrs miller with a smile which would have become an angel he cryed what say you madam
shall we take a hackneycoach and all of us together pay a visit to your friend
i promise you it is not the first visit i have made in a prison  every reader i believe will be able to answer for the worthy woman but they must have a great deal of goodnature and be well acquainted with friendship who can feel what she felt on this occasion
few i hope are capable of feeling what now passed in the mind of blifil but those who are will acknowledge that it was impossible for him to raise any objection to this visit
fortune however or the gentleman lately mentioned above stood his friend and prevented his undergoing so great a shock for at the very instant when the coach was sent for partridge arrived and having called mrs miller from the company acquainted her with the dreadful accident lately come to light and hearing mr allworthy's intention begged her to find some means of stopping him for says he the matter must at all hazards be kept a secret from him and if he should now go he will find mr jones and his mother who arrived just as i left him lamenting over one another the horrid crime they have ignorantly committed  the poor woman who was almost deprived of her senses at his dreadful news was never less capable of invention than at present
however as women are much readier at this than men she bethought herself of an excuse and returning to allworthy said i am sure sir you will be surprized at hearing any objection from me to the kind proposal you just now made and yet i am afraid of the consequence of it if carried immediately into execution
you must imagine sir that all the calamities which have lately befallen this poor young fellow must have thrown him into the lowest dejection of spirits and now sir should we all on a sudden fling him into such a violent fit of joy as i know your presence will occasion it may i am afraid produce some fatal mischief especially as his servant who is without tells me he is very far from being well  is his servant without cries allworthy pray call him hither
i will ask him some questions concerning his master  partridge was at first afraid to appear before mr allworthy but was at length persuaded after mrs miller who had often heard his whole story from his own mouth had promised to introduce him
allworthy recollected partridge the moment he came into the room though many years had passed since he had seen him
mrs miller therefore might have spared here a formal oration in which indeed she was something prolix for the reader i believe may have observed already that the good woman among other things had a tongue always ready for the service of her friends
and are you said allworthy to partridge the servant of mr jones  i can't say sir answered he that i am regularly a servant but i live with him an't please your honour at present
non sum qualis eram as your honour very well knows  mr allworthy then asked him many questions concerning jones as to his health and other matters to all which partridge answered without having the least regard to what was but considered only what he would have things appear for a strict adherence to truth was not among the articles of this honest fellow's morality or his religion
during this dialogue mr nightingale took his leave and presently after mrs miller left the room when allworthy likewise despatched blifil for he imagined that partridge when alone with him would be more explicit than before company
they were no sooner left in private together than allworthy began as in the following chapter
chapter vi
in which the history is farther continued   sure friend said the good man you are the strangest of all human beings
not only to have suffered as you have formerly for obstinately persisting in a falshood but to persist in it thus to the last and to pass thus upon the world for a servant of your own son
what interest can you have in all this
what can be your motive  i see sir said partridge falling down upon his knees that your honour is prepossessed against me and resolved not to believe anything i say and therefore what signifies my protestations
but yet there is one above who knows that i am not the father of this young man  how said allworthy will you yet deny what you was formerly convicted of upon such unanswerable such manifest evidence
nay what a confirmation is your being now found with this very man of all which twenty years ago appeared against you
i thought you had left the country
nay i thought you had been long since deadin what manner did you know anything of this young man
where did you meet with him unless you had kept some correspondence together
do not deny this for i promise you it will greatly raise your son in my opinion to find that he hath such a sense of filial duty as privately to support his father for so many years  if your honour will have patience to hear me said partridge i will tell you allbeing bid go on he proceeded thus when your honour conceived that displeasure against me it ended in my ruin soon after for i lost my little school and the minister thinking i suppose it would be agreeable to your honour turned me out from the office of clerk so that i had nothing to trust to but the barber's shop which in a country place like that is a poor livelihood and when my wife died for till that time i received a pension of  a year from an unknown hand which indeed i believe was your honour's own for nobody that ever i heard of doth these things besidesbut as i was saying when she died this pension forsook me so that now as i owed two or three small debts which began to be troublesome to me particularly one which an attorney brought up by lawcharges from s
to near  and as i found all my usual means of living had forsook me i packed up my little all as well as i could and went off
 this is a fact which i knew happen to a poor clergyman in   dorsetshire by the villany of an attorney who not contented with   the exorbitant costs to which the poor man was put by a single   action brought afterwards another action on the judgment as it was   called
a method frequently used to oppress the poor and bring   money into the pockets of attorneys to the great scandal of the   law of the nation of christianity and even of human nature   itself
the first place i came to was salisbury where i got into the service of a gentleman belonging to the law and one of the best gentlemen that ever i knew for he was not only good to me but i know a thousand good and charitable acts which he did while i staid with him and i have known him often refuse business because it was paultry and oppressive you need not be so particular said allworthy i know this gentleman and a very worthy man he is and an honour to his professionwell sir continued partridge from hence i removed to lymington where i was above three years in the service of another lawyer who was likewise a very good sort of a man and to be sure one of the merriest gentlemen in england
well sir at the end of the three years i set up a little school and was likely to do well again had it not been for a most unlucky accident
here i kept a pig and one day as ill fortune would have it this pig broke out and did a trespass i think they call it in a garden belonging to one of my neighbours who was a proud revengeful man and employed a lawyer oneonei can't think of his name but he sent for a writ against me and had me to size
when i came there lord have mercy upon meto hear what the counsellors said
there was one that told my lord a parcel of the confoundedest lies about me he said that i used to drive my hogs into other folk's gardens and a great deal more and at last he said he hoped i had at last brought my hogs to a fair market
to be sure one would have thought that instead of being owner only of one poor little pig i had been the greatest hogmerchant in england
well pray said allworthy do not be so particular i have heard nothing of your son yet o it was a great many years  answered partridge before i saw my son as you are pleased to call himi went over to ireland after this and taught school at cork for that one suit ruined me again and i lay seven years in winchester jailwell said allworthy pass that over till your return to englandthen sir said he it was about half a year ago that i landed at bristol where i staid some time and not finding it do there and hearing of a place between that and gloucester where the barber was just dead i went thither and there i had been about two months when mr jones came thither he then gave allworthy a very particular account of their first meeting and of everything as well as he could remember which had happened from that day to this frequently interlarding his story with panegyrics on jones and not forgetting to insinuate the great love and respect which he had for allworthy
he concluded with saying now sir i have told your honour the whole truth and then repeated a most solemn protestation that he was no more the father of jones than of the pope of rome  and imprecated the most bitter curses on his head if he did not speak truth
what am i to think of this matter cries allworthy
for what purpose should you so strongly deny a fact which i think it would be rather your interest to own nay sir answered partridge for he could hold no longer if your honour will not believe me you are like soon to have satisfaction enough
i wish you had mistaken the mother of this young man as well as you have his fatherand now being asked what he meant with all the symptoms of horror both in his voice and countenance he told allworthy the whole story which he had a little before expressed such desire to mrs miller to conceal from him
allworthy was almost as much shocked at this discovery as partridge himself had been while he related it
good heavens says he in what miserable distresses do vice and imprudence involve men
how much beyond our designs are the effects of wickedness sometimes carried  he had scarce uttered these words when mrs waters came hastily and abruptly into the room
partridge no sooner saw her than he cried here sir here is the very woman herself
this is the unfortunate mother of mr jones
i am sure she will acquit me before your honour
pray madam  mrs waters without paying any regard to what partridge said and almost without taking any notice of him advanced to mr allworthy
i believe sir it is so long since i had the honour of seeing you that you do not recollect me indeed answered allworthy you are so very much altered on many accounts that had not this man already acquainted me who you are i should not have immediately called you to my remembrance
have you madam any particular business which brings you to me allworthy spoke this with great reserve for the reader may easily believe he was not well pleased with the conduct of this lady neither with what he had formerly heard nor with what partridge had now delivered
mrs waters answeredindeed sir i have very particular business with you and it is such as i can impart only to yourself
i must desire therefore the favour of a word with you alone for i assure you what i have to tell you is of the utmost importance  partridge was then ordered to withdraw but before he went he begged the lady to satisfy mr allworthy that he was perfectly innocent
to which she answered you need be under no apprehension sir i shall satisfy mr allworthy very perfectly of that matter  then partridge withdrew and that past between mr allworthy and mrs waters which is written in the next chapter
chapter vii
continuation of the history
mrs waters remaining a few moments silent mr allworthy could not refrain from saying i am sorry madam to perceive by what i have since heard that you have made so very ill a use mr allworthy  says she interrupting him i know i have faults but ingratitude to you is not one of them
i never can nor shall forget your goodness which i own i have very little deserved but be pleased to wave all upbraiding me at present as i have so important an affair to communicate to you concerning this young man to whom you have given my maiden name of jones  have i then said allworthy ignorantly punished an innocent man in the person of him who hath just left us
was he not the father of the child indeed he was not said mrs waters
you may be pleased to remember sir i formerly told you you should one day know and i acknowledge myself to have been guilty of a cruel neglect in not having discovered it to you before
indeed i little knew how necessary it was well madam said allworthy be pleased to proceed you must remember sir said she a young fellow whose name was summer very well cries allworthy he was the son of a clergyman of great learning and virtue for whom i had the highest friendship so it appeared sir answered she for i believe you bred the young man up and maintained him at the university where i think he had finished his studies when he came to reside at your house a finer man i must say the sun never shone upon for besides the handsomest person i ever saw he was so genteel and had so much wit and good breeding poor gentleman said allworthy he was indeed untimely snatched away and little did i think he had any sins of this kind to answer for for i plainly perceive you are going to tell me he was the father of your child  indeed sir answered she he was not how said allworthy to what then tends all this preface to a story said she which i am concerned falls to my lot to unfold to you
o sir
prepare to hear something which will surprize you will grieve you speak said allworthy i am conscious of no crime and cannot be afraid to hear  sir said she that mr summer the son of your friend educated at your expense who after living a year in the house as if he had been your own son died there of the smallpox was tenderly lamented by you and buried as if he had been your own that summer sir was the father of this child how said allworthy you contradict yourself that i do not answered she he was indeed the father of this child but not by me take care madam said allworthy do not to shun the imputation of any crime be guilty of falshood
remember there is one from whom you can conceal nothing and before whose tribunal falshood will only aggravate your guilt indeed sir says she i am not his mother nor would i now think myself so for the world i know your reason said allworthy and shall rejoice as much as you to find it otherwise yet you must remember you yourself confest it before me so far what i confest said she was true that these hands conveyed the infant to your bed conveyed it thither at the command of its mother at her commands i afterwards owned it and thought myself by her generosity nobly rewarded both for my secrecy and my shame who could this woman be said allworthy
indeed i tremble to name her answered mrs waters
by all this preparation i am to guess that she was a relation of mine  cried he
indeed she was a near one at which words allworthy started and she continuedyou had a sister sir a sister  repeated he looking aghastas there is truth in heaven cries she your sister was the mother of that child you found between your sheets can it be possible cries he good heavens have patience sir said mrs waters and i will unfold to you the whole story
just after your departure for london miss bridget came one day to the house of my mother
she was pleased to say she had heard an extraordinary character of me for my learning and superior understanding to all the young women there so she was pleased to say
she then bid me come to her to the great house where when i attended she employed me to read to her
she expressed great satisfaction in my reading shewed great kindness to me and made me many presents
at last she began to catechise me on the subject of secrecy to which i gave her such satisfactory answers that at last having locked the door of her room she took me into her closet and then locking that door likewise she said she should convince me of the vast reliance she had on my integrity by communicating a secret in which her honour and consequently her life was concerned
she then stopt and after a silence of a few minutes during which she often wiped her eyes she enquired of me if i thought my mother might safely be confided in
i answered i would stake my life on her fidelity
she then imparted to me the great secret which laboured in her breast and which i believe was delivered with more pains than she afterwards suffered in childbirth
it was then contrived that my mother and myself only should attend at the time and that mrs wilkins should be sent out of the way as she accordingly was to the very furthest part of dorsetshire to enquire the character of a servant for the lady had turned away her own maid near three months before during all which time i officiated about her person upon trial as she said though as she afterwards declared i was not sufficiently handy for the place
this and many other such things which she used to say of me were all thrown out to prevent any suspicion which wilkins might hereafter have when i was to own the child for she thought it could never be believed she would venture to hurt a young woman with whom she had intrusted such a secret
you may be assured sir i was well paid for all these affronts which together with being informed with the occasion of them very well contented me
indeed the lady had a greater suspicion of mrs wilkins than of any other person not that she had the least aversion to the gentlewoman but she thought her incapable of keeping a secret especially from you sir for i have often heard miss bridget say that if mrs wilkins had committed a murder she believed she would acquaint you with it
at last the expected day came and mrs wilkins who had been kept a week in readiness and put off from time to time upon some pretence or other that she might not return too soon was dispatched
then the child was born in the presence only of myself and my mother and was by my mother conveyed to her own house where it was privately kept by her till the evening of your return when i by the command of miss bridget conveyed it into the bed where you found it
and all suspicions were afterwards laid asleep by the artful conduct of your sister in pretending illwill to the boy and that any regard she shewed him was out of meer complacence to you  mrs waters then made many protestations of the truth of this story and concluded by saying thus sir you have at last discovered your nephew for so i am sure you will hereafter think him and i question not but he will be both an honour and a comfort to you under that appellation  i need not madam said allworthy express my astonishment at what you have told me and yet surely you would not and could not have put together so many circumstances to evidence an untruth
i confess i recollect some passages relating to that summer which formerly gave me a conceit that my sister had some liking to him
i mentioned it to her for i had such a regard to the young man as well on his own account as on his father's that i should willingly have consented to a match between them but she exprest the highest disdain of my unkind suspicion as she called it so that i never spoke more on the subject
good heavens
well
the lord disposeth all thingsyet sure it was a most unjustifiable conduct in my sister to carry this secret with her out of the world i promise you sir said mrs waters she always profest a contrary intention and frequently told me she intended one day to communicate it to you
she said indeed she was highly rejoiced that her plot had succeeded so well and that you had of your own accord taken such a fancy to the child that it was yet unnecessary to make any express declaration
oh
sir had that lady lived to have seen this poor young man turned like a vagabond from your house nay sir could she have lived to hear that you had yourself employed a lawyer to prosecute him for a murder of which he was not guiltyforgive me mr allworthy i must say it was unkindindeed you have been abused he never deserved it of you  indeed madam said allworthy i have been abused by the person whoever he was that told you so nay sir said she i would not be mistaken i did not presume to say you were guilty of any wrong
the gentleman who came to me proposed no such matter he only said taking me for mr fitzpatrick's wife that if mr jones had murdered my husband i should be assisted with any money i wanted to carry on the prosecution by a very worthy gentleman who he said was well apprized what a villain i had to deal with
it was by this man i found out who mr jones was and this man whose name is dowling mr jones tells me is your steward
i discovered his name by a very odd accident for he himself refused to tell it me but partridge who met him at my lodgings the second time he came knew him formerly at salisbury  and did this mr dowling says allworthy with great astonishment in his countenance tell you that i would assist in the prosecutionno sir answered she i will not charge him wrongfully
he said i should be assisted but he mentioned no name
yet you must pardon me sir if from circumstances i thought it could be no otherindeed madam says allworthy from circumstances i am too well convinced it was another
good heaven
by what wonderful means is the blackest and deepest villany sometimes discoveredshall i beg you madam to stay till the person you have mentioned comes for i expect him every minute
nay he may be perhaps already in the house  allworthy then stept to the door in order to call a servant when in came not mr dowling but the gentleman who will be seen in the next chapter
chapter viii
further continuation
the gentleman who now arrived was no other than mr western
he no sooner saw allworthy than without considering in the least the presence of mrs waters he began to vociferate in the following manner fine doings at my house
a rare kettle of fish i have discovered at last
who the devil would be plagued with a daughter  what's the matter neighbour said allworthy
matter enough  answered western when i thought she was just a coming to nay when she had in a manner promised me to do as i would ha her and when i was a hoped to have had nothing more to do than to have sent for the lawyer and finished all what do you think i have found out
that the little b hath bin playing tricks with me all the while and carrying on a correspondence with that bastard of yours
sister western whom i have quarrelled with upon her account sent me word o't and i ordered her pockets to be searched when she was asleep and here i have got un signed with the son of a whore's own name
i have not had patience to read half o't for 'tis longer than one of parson supple's sermons but i find plainly it is all about love and indeed what should it be else
i have packed her up in chamber again and tomorrow morning down she goes into the country unless she consents to be married directly and there she shall live in a garret upon bread and water all her days and the sooner such a b breaks her heart the better though dn her that i believe is too tough
she will live long enough to plague me mr western answered allworthy you know i have always protested against force and you yourself consented that none should be used ay cries he that was only upon condition that she would consent without
what the devil and doctor faustus
shan't i do what i will with my own daughter especially when i desire nothing but her own good well neighbour answered allworthy if you will give me leave i will undertake once to argue with the young lady will you said western why that is kind now and neighbourly and mayhap you will do more than i have been able to do with her for i promise you she hath a very good opinion of you  well sir said allworthy if you will go home and release the young lady from her captivity i will wait upon her within this halfhour but suppose said western she should run away with un in the meantime
for lawyer dowling tells me there is no hopes of hanging the fellow at last for that the man is alive and like to do well and that he thinks jones will be out of prison again presently  how said allworthy what did you employ him then to enquire or to do anything in that matter not i answered western he mentioned it to me just now of his own accord just now cries allworthy why where did you see him then
i want much to see mr dowling  why you may see un an you will presently at my lodgings for there is to be a meeting of lawyers there this morning about a mortgage
'icod
i shall lose two or dree thousand pounds i believe by that honest gentleman mr nightingale well sir said allworthy i will be with you within the halfhour and do for once cries the squire take a fool's advice never think of dealing with her by gentle methods take my word for it those will never do
i have tried 'um long enough
she must be frightened into it there is no other way
tell her i'm her father and of the horrid sin of disobedience and of the dreadful punishment of it in t'other world and then tell her about being locked up all her life in a garret in this and being kept only on bread and water i will do all i can said allworthy for i promise you there is nothing i wish for more than an alliance with this amiable creature nay the girl is well enough for matter o' that cries the squire a man may go farther and meet with worse meat that i may declare o'her thof she be my own daughter
and if she will but be obedient to me there is narrow a father within a hundred miles o' the place that loves a daughter better than i do but i see you are busy with the lady here so i will go huome and expect you and so your humble servant  as soon as mr western was gone mrs waters said i see sir the squire hath not the least remembrance of my face
i believe mr allworthy you would not have known me neither
i am very considerably altered since that day when you so kindly gave me that advice which i had been happy had i followed indeed madam cries allworthy it gave me great concern when i first heard the contrary indeed sir  says she i was ruined by a very deep scheme of villany which if you knew though i pretend not to think it would justify me in your opinion it would at least mitigate my offence and induce you to pity me you are not now at leisure to hear my whole story but this i assure you i was betrayed by the most solemn promises of marriage nay in the eye of heaven i was married to him for after much reading on the subject i am convinced that particular ceremonies are only requisite to give a legal sanction to marriage and have only a worldly use in giving a woman the privileges of a wife but that she who lives constant to one man after a solemn private affiance whatever the world may call her hath little to charge on her own conscience i am sorry madam said allworthy you made so ill a use of your learning
indeed it would have been well that you had been possessed of much more or had remained in a state of ignorance
and yet madam i am afraid you have more than this sin to answer for during his life answered she which was above a dozen years i most solemnly assure you i had not
and consider sir on my behalf what is in the power of a woman stript of her reputation and left destitute whether the goodnatured world will suffer such a stray sheep to return to the road of virtue even if she was never so desirous
i protest then i would have chose it had it been in my power but necessity drove me into the arms of captain waters with whom though still unmarried i lived as a wife for many years and went by his name
i parted with this gentleman at worcester on his march against the rebels and it was then i accidentally met with mr jones who rescued me from the hands of a villain
indeed he is the worthiest of men
no young gentleman of his age is i believe freer from vice and few have the twentieth part of his virtues nay whatever vices he hath had i am firmly persuaded he hath now taken a resolution to abandon them i hope he hath cries allworthy and i hope he will preserve that resolution
i must say i have still the same hopes with regard to yourself
the world i do agree are apt to be too unmerciful on these occasions yet time and perseverance will get the better of this their disinclination as i may call it to pity for though they are not like heaven ready to receive a penitent sinner yet a continued repentance will at length obtain mercy even with the world
this you may be assured of mrs waters that whenever i find you are sincere in such good intentions you shall want no assistance in my power to make them effectual  mrs waters fell now upon her knees before him and in a flood of tears made him many most passionate acknowledgments of his goodness which as she truly said savoured more of the divine than human nature
allworthy raised her up and spoke in the most tender manner making use of every expression which his invention could suggest to comfort her when he was interrupted by the arrival of mr dowling who upon his first entrance seeing mrs waters started and appeared in some confusion from which he soon recovered himself as well as he could and then said he was in the utmost haste to attend counsel at mr western's lodgings but however thought it his duty to call and acquaint him with the opinion of counsel upon the case which he had before told him which was that the conversion of the moneys in that case could not be questioned in a criminal cause but that an action of trover might be brought and if it appeared to the jury to be the moneys of plaintiff that plaintiff would recover a verdict for the value
allworthy without making any answer to this bolted the door and then advancing with a stern look to dowling he said whatever be your haste sir i must first receive an answer to some questions
do you know this ladythat lady sir answered dowling with great hesitation
allworthy then with the most solemn voice said look you mr dowling as you value my favour or your continuance a moment longer in my service do not hesitate nor prevaricate but answer faithfully and truly to every question i askdo you know this ladyyes sir said dowling i have seen the lady where sir at her own lodgingsupon what business did you go thither sir and who sent you i went sir to enquire sir about mr jones and who sent you to enquire about him who sir
why sir mr blifil sent me and what did you say to the lady concerning that matter nay sir it is impossible to recollect every word will you please madam to assist the gentleman's memory he told me sir said mrs waters that if mr jones had murdered my husband i should be assisted by any money i wanted to carry on the prosecution by a very worthy gentleman who was well apprized what a villain i had to deal with
these i can safely swear were the very words he spokewere these the words sir said allworthy
i cannot charge my memory exactly cries dowling but i believe i did speak to that purposeand did mr blifil order you to say so i am sure sir i should not have gone on my own accord nor have willingly exceeded my authority in matters of this kind
if i said so i must have so understood mr blifil's instructions look you mr dowling said allworthy i promise you before this lady that whatever you have done in this affair by mr blifil's order i will forgive provided you now tell me strictly the truth for i believe what you say that you would not have acted of your own accord and without authority in this mattermr blifil then likewise sent you to examine the two fellows at aldersgatehe did sir well and what instructions did he then give you
recollect as well as you can and tell me as near as possible the very words he usedwhy sir mr blifil sent me to find out the persons who were eyewitnesses of this fight
he said he feared they might be tampered with by mr jones or some of his friends
he said blood required blood and that not only all who concealed a murderer but those who omitted anything in their power to bring him to justice were sharers in his guilt
he said he found you was very desirous of having the villain brought to justice though it was not proper you should appear in it he did so says allworthyyes sir cries dowling i should not i am sure have proceeded such lengths for the sake of any other person living but your worshipwhat lengths sir said allworthynay sir  cries dowling i would not have your worship think i would on any account be guilty of subornation of perjury but there are two ways of delivering evidence
i told them therefore that if any offers should be made them on the other side they should refuse them and that they might be assured they should lose nothing by being honest men and telling the truth
i said we were told that mr jones had assaulted the gentleman first and that if that was the truth they should declare it and i did give them some hints that they should be no losersi think you went lengths indeed cries allworthynay sir answered dowling i am sure i did not desire them to tell an untruthnor should i have said what i did unless it had been to oblige youyou would not have thought i believe  says allworthy to have obliged me had you known that this mr jones was my own nephewi am sure sir answered he it did not become me to take any notice of what i thought you desired to concealhow cries allworthy and did you know it thennay sir answered dowling if your worship bids me speak the truth i am sure i shall do itindeed sir i did know it for they were almost the last words which madam blifil ever spoke which she mentioned to me as i stood alone by her bedside when she delivered me the letter i brought your worship from herwhat letter cries allworthythe letter sir answered dowling which i brought from salisbury and which i delivered into the hands of mr blifilo heavens cries allworthy well and what were the words
what did my sister say to youshe took me by the hand answered he and as she delivered me the letter said i scarce know what i have written
tell my brother mr jones is his nephewhe is my sonbless him' says she and then fell backward as if dying away
i presently called in the people and she never spoke more to me and died within a few minutes afterwardsallworthy stood a minute silent lifting up his eyes and then turning to dowling said how came you sir not to deliver me this message your worship answered he must remember that you was at that time ill in bed and being in a violent hurry as indeed i always am i delivered the letter and message to mr blifil who told me he would carry them both to you which he hath since told me he did and that your worship partly out of friendship to mr jones and partly out of regard to your sister would never have it mentioned and did intend to conceal it from the world and therefore sir if you had not mentioned it to me first i am certain i should never have thought it belonged to me to say anything of the matter either to your worship or any other person  we have remarked somewhere already that it is possible for a man to convey a lie in the words of truth this was the case at present for blifil had in fact told dowling what he now related but had not imposed upon him nor indeed had imagined he was able so to do
in reality the promises which blifil had made to dowling were the motives which had induced him to secrecy and as he now very plainly saw blifil would not be able to keep them he thought proper now to make this confession which the promises of forgiveness joined to the threats the voice the looks of allworthy and the discoveries he had made before extorted from him who was besides taken unawares and had no time to consider of evasions
allworthy appeared well satisfied with this relation and having enjoined on dowling strict silence as to what had past conducted that gentleman himself to the door lest he should see blifil who was returned to his chamber where he exulted in the thoughts of his last deceit on his uncle and little suspected what had since passed belowstairs
as allworthy was returning to his room he met mrs miller in the entry who with a face all pale and full of terror said to him o
sir i find this wicked woman hath been with you and you know all yet do not on this account abandon the poor young man
consider sir he was ignorant it was his own mother and the discovery itself will most probably break his heart without your unkindness  madam says allworthy i am under such an astonishment at what i have heard that i am really unable to satisfy you but come with me into my room
indeed mrs miller i have made surprizing discoveries and you shall soon know them  the poor woman followed him trembling and now allworthy going up to mrs waters took her by the hand and then turning to mrs miller said what reward shall i bestow upon this gentlewoman for the services she hath done meo
mrs miller you have a thousand times heard me call the young man to whom you are so faithful a friend my son
little did i then think he was indeed related to me at allyour friend madam is my nephew he is the brother of that wicked viper which i have so long nourished in my bosomshe will herself tell you the whole story and how the youth came to pass for her son
indeed mrs miller i am convinced that he hath been wronged and that i have been abused abused by one whom you too justly suspected of being a villain
he is in truth the worst of villains  the joy which mrs miller now felt bereft her of the power of speech and might perhaps have deprived her of her senses if not of life had not a friendly shower of tears come seasonably to her relief
at length recovering so far from her transport as to be able to speak she cried and is my dear mr jones then your nephew sir and not the son of this lady
and are your eyes opened to him at last
and shall i live to see him as happy as he deserves he certainly is my nephew  says allworthy and i hope all the restand is this the dear good woman the person cries she to whom all this discovery is owingshe is indeed says allworthywhy then cried mrs miller upon her knees may heaven shower down its choicest blessings upon her head and for this one good action forgive her all her sins be they never so many  mrs waters then informed them that she believed jones would very shortly be released for that the surgeon was gone in company with a nobleman to the justice who committed him in order to certify that mr fitzpatrick was out of all manner of danger and to procure his prisoner his liberty
allworthy said he should be glad to find his nephew there at his return home but that he was then obliged to go on some business of consequence
he then called to a servant to fetch him a chair and presently left the two ladies together
mr blifil hearing the chair ordered came downstairs to attend upon his uncle for he never was deficient in such acts of duty
he asked his uncle if he was going out which is a civil way of asking a man whither he is going to which the other making no answer he again desired to know when he would be pleased to returnallworthy made no answer to this neither till he was just going into his chair and then turning about he saidharkee sir do you find out before my return the letter which your mother sent me on her deathbed  allworthy then departed and left blifil in a situation to be envied only by a man who is just going to be hanged
chapter ix
a further continuation
allworthy took an opportunity whilst he was in the chair of reading the letter from jones to sophia which western delivered him and there were some expressions in it concerning himself which drew tears from his eyes
at length he arrived at mr western's and was introduced to sophia
when the first ceremonies were past and the gentleman and lady had taken their chairs a silence of some minutes ensued during which the latter who had been prepared for the visit by her father sat playing with her fan and had every mark of confusion both in her countenance and behaviour
at length allworthy who was himself a little disconcerted began thus i am afraid miss western my family hath been the occasion of giving you some uneasiness to which i fear i have innocently become more instrumental than i intended
be assured madam had i at first known how disagreeable the proposals had been i should not have suffered you to have been so long persecuted
i hope therefore you will not think the design of this visit is to trouble you with any further solicitations of that kind but entirely to relieve you from them  sir said sophia with a little modest hesitation this behaviour is most kind and generous and such as i could expect only from mr allworthy but as you have been so kind to mention this matter you will pardon me for saying it hath indeed given me great uneasiness and hath been the occasion of my suffering much cruel treatment from a father who was till that unhappy affair the tenderest and fondest of all parents
i am convinced sir you are too good and generous to resent my refusal of your nephew
our inclinations are not in our own power and whatever may be his merit i cannot force them in his favour i assure you most amiable young lady said allworthy i am capable of no such resentment had the person been my own son and had i entertained the highest esteem for him
for you say truly madam we cannot force our inclinations much less can they be directed by another oh
sir answered sophia every word you speak proves you deserve that good that great that benevolent character the whole world allows you
i assure you sir nothing less than the certain prospect of future misery could have made me resist the commands of my father i sincerely believe you madam replied allworthy and i heartily congratulate you on your prudent foresight since by so justifiable a resistance you have avoided misery indeed you speak now mr allworthy cries she with a delicacy which few men are capable of feeling
but surely in my opinion to lead our lives with one to whom we are indifferent must be a state of wretchednessperhaps that wretchedness would be even increased by a sense of the merits of an object to whom we cannot give our affections
if i had married mr blifil pardon my interrupting you madam answered allworthy but i cannot bear the suppositionbelieve me miss western i rejoice from my heart i rejoice in your escapei have discovered the wretch for whom you have suffered all this cruel violence from your father to be a villain how sir cries sophiayou must believe this surprizes meit hath surprized me madam answered allworthy and so it will the worldbut i have acquainted you with the real truth  nothing but truth says sophia can i am convinced come from the lips of mr allworthyyet sir such sudden such unexpected newsdiscovered you saymay villany be ever soyou will soon enough hear the story cries allworthyat present let us not mention so detested a namei have another matter of a very serious nature to proposeo
miss western i know your vast worth nor can i so easily part with the ambition of being allied to iti have a near relation madam a young man whose character is i am convinced the very opposite to that of this wretch and whose fortune i will make equal to what his was to have been
could i madam hope you would admit a visit from him sophia after a minute's silence answered i will deal with the utmost sincerity with mr allworthy
his character and the obligation i have just received from him demand it
i have determined at present to listen to no such proposals from any person
my only desire is to be restored to the affection of my father and to be again the mistress of his family
this sir i hope to owe to your good offices
let me beseech you let me conjure you by all the goodness which i and all who know you have experienced do not the very moment when you have released me from one persecution do not engage me in another as miserable and as fruitless indeed miss western replied allworthy i am capable of no such conduct and if this be your resolution he must submit to the disappointment whatever torments he may suffer under it i must smile now mr allworthy answered sophia when you mention the torments of a man whom i do not know and who can consequently have so little acquaintance with me pardon me dear young lady cries allworthy i begin now to be afraid he hath had too much acquaintance for the repose of his future days since if ever man was capable of a sincere violent and noble passion such i am convinced is my unhappy nephew's for miss western a nephew of your's mr allworthy answered sophia
it is surely strange
i never heard of him before indeed madam cries allworthy it is only the circumstance of his being my nephew to which you are a stranger and which till this day was a secret to memr jones who has long loved you he
he is my nephew mr jones your nephew sir cries sophia can it be possiblehe is indeed madam  answered allworthy he is my own sister's sonas such i shall always own him nor am i ashamed of owning him
i am much more ashamed of my past behaviour to him but i was as ignorant of his merit as of his birth
indeed miss western i have used him cruellyindeed i havehere the good man wiped his eyes and after a short pause proceededi never shall be able to reward him for his sufferings without your assistancebelieve me most amiable young lady i must have a great esteem of that offering which i make to your worth
i know he hath been guilty of faults but there is great goodness of heart at the bottom
believe me madam there is here he stopped seeming to expect an answer which he presently received from sophia after she had a little recovered herself from the hurry of spirits into which so strange and sudden information had thrown her i sincerely wish you joy sir of a discovery in which you seem to have such satisfaction
i doubt not but you will have all the comfort you can promise yourself from it
the young gentleman hath certainly a thousand good qualities which makes it impossible he should not behave well to such an unclei hope madam said allworthy he hath those good qualities which must make him a good husbandhe must i am sure be of all men the most abandoned if a lady of your merit should condescend you must pardon me mr allworthy answered sophia i cannot listen to a proposal of this kind
mr jones i am convinced hath much merit but i shall never receive mr jones as one who is to be my husbandupon my honour i never willpardon me madam cries allworthy if i am a little surprized after what i have heard from mr westerni hope the unhappy young man hath done nothing to forfeit your good opinion if he had ever the honour to enjoy itperhaps he may have been misrepresented to you as he was to me
the same villany may have injured him everywherehe is no murderer i assure you as he hath been calledmr allworthy answered sophia i have told you my resolution
i wonder not at what my father hath told you but whatever his apprehensions or fears have been if i know my heart i have given no occasion for them since it hath always been a fixed principle with me never to have married without his consent
this is i think the duty of a child to a parent and this i hope nothing could ever have prevailed with me to swerve from
i do not indeed conceive that the authority of any parent can oblige us to marry in direct opposition to our inclinations
to avoid a force of this kind which i had reason to suspect i left my father's house and sought protection elsewhere
this is the truth of my story and if the world or my father carry my intentions any farther my own conscience will acquit me i hear you miss western cries allworthy with admiration
i admire the justness of your sentiments but surely there is more in this
i am cautious of offending you young lady but am i to look on all which i have hitherto heard or seen as a dream only
and have you suffered so much cruelty from your father on the account of a man to whom you have been always absolutely indifferent i beg mr allworthy answered sophia you will not insist on my reasonsyes i have suffered indeed i will not mr allworthy conceali will be very sincere with youi own i had a great opinion of mr jonesi believei know i have suffered for my opinioni have been treated cruelly by my aunt as well as by my father but that is now pasti beg i may not be farther pressed for whatever hath been my resolution is now fixed
your nephew sir hath many virtueshe hath great virtues mr allworthy
i question not but he will do you honour in the world and make you happyi wish i could make him so madam replied allworthy but that i am convinced is only in your power
it is that conviction which hath made me so earnest a solicitor in his favour  you are deceived indeed sir you are deceived said sophia
i hope not by him
it is sufficient to have deceived me
mr allworthy i must insist on being pressed no farther on this subject
i should be sorrynay i will not injure him in your favour
i wish mr jones very well
i sincerely wish him well and i repeat it again to you whatever demerit he may have to me i am certain he hath many good qualities
i do not disown my former thoughts but nothing can ever recal them
at present there is not a man upon earth whom i would more resolutely reject than mr jones nor would the addresses of mr blifil himself be less agreeable to me  western had been long impatient for the event of this conference and was just now arrived at the door to listen when having heard the last sentiments of his daughter's heart he lost all temper and bursting open the door in a rage cried outit is a lie
it is a dn'd lie
it is all owing to that dn'd rascal jones and if she could get at un she'd ha un any hour of the day here allworthy interposed and addressing himself to the squire with some anger in his look he said mr western you have not kept your word with me
you promised to abstain from all violencewhy so i did cries western as long as it was possible but to hear a wench telling such confounded lieszounds
doth she think if she can make vools of other volk she can make one of meno no i know her better than thee dost i am sorry to tell you sir answered allworthy it doth not appear by your behaviour to this young lady that you know her at all
i ask pardon for what i say but i think our intimacy your own desires and the occasion justify me
she is your daughter mr western and i think she doth honour to your name
if i was capable of envy i should sooner envy you on this account than any other man whateverodrabbit it cries the squire i wish she was thine with all my heartwouldst soon be glad to be rid of the trouble o' her indeed my good friend answered allworthy you yourself are the cause of all the trouble you complain of
place that confidence in the young lady which she so well deserves and i am certain you will be the happiest father on earthi confidence in her cries the squire
'sblood
what confidence can i place in her when she won't do as i would ha' her
let her gi' but her consent to marry as i would ha' her and i'll place as much confidence in her as wouldst ha' meyou have no right neighbour answered allworthy to insist on any such consent
a negative voice your daughter allows you and god and nature have thought proper to allow you no morea negative voice cries the squire ay
ay
i'll show you what a negative voice i hago along go into your chamber go you stubborn indeed mr western said allworthy indeed you use her cruellyi cannot bear to see thisyou shall you must behave to her in a kinder manner
she deserves the best of treatment yes yes said the squire i know what she deserves now she's gone i'll shew you what she deserves
see here sir here is a letter from my cousin my lady bellaston in which she is so kind to gi' me to understand that the fellow is got out of prison again and here she advises me to take all the care i can o' the wench
odzookers
neighbour allworthy you don't know what it is to govern a daughter  the squire ended his speech with some compliments to his own sagacity and then allworthy after a formal preface acquainted him with the whole discovery which he had made concerning jones with his anger to blifil and with every particular which hath been disclosed to the reader in the preceding chapters
men overviolent in their dispositions are for the most part as changeable in them
no sooner then was western informed of mr allworthy's intention to make jones his heir than he joined heartily with the uncle in every commendation of the nephew and became as eager for her marriage with jones as he had before been to couple her to blifil
here mr allworthy was again forced to interpose and to relate what had passed between him and sophia at which he testified great surprize
the squire was silent a moment and looked wild with astonishment at this accountat last he cried out why what can be the meaning of this neighbour allworthy
vond o'un she was that i'll be sworn toodzookers
i have hit o't
as sure as a gun i have hit o' the very right o't
it's all along o' zister
the girl hath got a hankering after this son of a whore of a lord
i vound 'em together at my cousin my lady bellaston's
he hath turned the head o' her that's certainbut dn me if he shall ha heri'll ha no lords nor courtiers in my vamily  allworthy now made a long speech in which he repeated his resolution to avoid all violent measures and very earnestly recommended gentle methods to mr western as those by which he might be assured of succeeding best with his daughter
he then took his leave and returned back to mrs miller but was forced to comply with the earnest entreaties of the squire in promising to bring mr jones to visit him that afternoon that he might as he said make all matters up with the young gentleman at mr allworthy's departure western promised to follow his advice in his behaviour to sophia saying i don't know how 'tis but dn me allworthy if you don't make me always do just as you please and yet i have as good an estate as you and am in the commission of the peace as well as yourself   chapter x  wherein the history begins to draw towards a conclusion
when allworthy returned to his lodgings he heard mr jones was just arrived before him
he hurried therefore instantly into an empty chamber whither he ordered mr jones to be brought to him alone
it is impossible to conceive a more tender or moving scene than the meeting between the uncle and nephew for mrs waters as the reader may well suppose had at her last visit discovered to him the secret of his birth
the first agonies of joy which were felt on both sides are indeed beyond my power to describe i shall not therefore attempt it
after allworthy had raised jones from his feet where he had prostrated himself and received him into his arms o my child he cried how have i been to blame
how have i injured you
what amends can i ever make you for those unkind those unjust suspicions which i have entertained and for all the sufferings they have occasioned to you am i not now made amends cries jones
would not my sufferings if they had been ten times greater have been now richly repaid
o my dear uncle this goodness this tenderness overpowers unmans destroys me
i cannot bear the transports which flow so fast upon me
to be again restored to your presence to your favour to be once more thus kindly received by my great my noble my generous benefactorindeed child cries allworthy i have used you cruellyhe then explained to him all the treachery of blifil and again repeated expressions of the utmost concern for having been induced by that treachery to use him so ill o talk not so  answered jones indeed sir you have used me nobly
the wisest man might be deceived as you were and under such a deception the best must have acted just as you did
your goodness displayed itself in the midst of your anger just as it then seemed
i owe everything to that goodness of which i have been most unworthy
do not put me on selfaccusation by carrying your generous sentiments too far
alas
sir i have not been punished more than i have deserved and it shall be the whole business of my future life to deserve that happiness you now bestow on me for believe me my dear uncle my punishment hath not been thrown away upon me though i have been a great i am not a hardened sinner i thank heaven i have had time to reflect on my past life where though i cannot charge myself with any gross villany yet i can discern follies and vices more than enough to repent and to be ashamed of follies which have been attended with dreadful consequences to myself and have brought me to the brink of destruction i am rejoiced my dear child answered allworthy to hear you talk thus sensibly for as i am convinced hypocrisy good heaven
how have i been imposed on by it in others
was never among your faults so i can readily believe all you say
you now see tom to what dangers imprudence alone may subject virtue for virtue i am now convinced you love in a great degree
prudence is indeed the duty which we owe to ourselves and if we will be so much our own enemies as to neglect it we are not to wonder if the world is deficient in discharging their duty to us for when a man lays the foundation of his own ruin others will i am afraid be too apt to build upon it
you say however you have seen your errors and will reform them
i firmly believe you my dear child and therefore from this moment you shall never be reminded of them by me
remember them only yourself so far as for the future to teach you the better to avoid them but still remember for your comfort that there is this great difference between those faults which candor may construe into imprudence and those which can be deduced from villany only
the former perhaps are even more apt to subject a man to ruin but if he reform his character will at length be totally retrieved the world though not immediately will in time be reconciled to him and he may reflect not without some mixture of pleasure on the dangers he hath escaped but villany my boy when once discovered is irretrievable the stains which this leaves behind no time will wash away
the censures of mankind will pursue the wretch their scorn will abash him in publick and if shame drives him into retirement he will go to it with all those terrors with which a weary child who is afraid of hobgoblins retreats from company to go to bed alone
here his murdered conscience will haunt himrepose like a false friend will fly from him
wherever he turns his eyes horror presents itself if he looks backward unavailable repentance treads on his heels if forward incurable despair stares him in the face till like a condemned prisoner confined in a dungeon he detests his present condition and yet dreads the consequence of that hour which is to relieve him from it
comfort yourself i say my child that this is not your case and rejoice with thankfulness to him who hath suffered you to see your errors before they have brought on you that destruction to which a persistance in even those errors must have led you
you have deserted them and the prospect now before you is such that happiness seems in your own power at these words jones fetched a deep sigh upon which when allworthy remonstrated he said sir i will conceal nothing from you i fear there is one consequence of my vices i shall never be able to retrieve
o my dear uncle
i have lost a treasure you need say no more answered allworthy i will be explicit with you i know what you lament i have seen the young lady and have discoursed with her concerning you
this i must insist on as an earnest of your sincerity in all you have said and of the stedfastness of your resolution that you obey me in one instance
to abide intirely by the determination of the young lady whether it shall be in your favour or no
she hath already suffered enough from solicitations which i hate to think of she shall owe no further constraint to my family i know her father will be as ready to torment her now on your account as he hath formerly been on another's but i am determined she shall suffer no more confinement no more violence no more uneasy hours o my dear uncle answered jones lay i beseech you some command on me in which i shall have some merit in obedience
believe me sir the only instance in which i could disobey you would be to give an uneasy moment to my sophia
no sir if i am so miserable to have incurred her displeasure beyond all hope of forgiveness that alone with the dreadful reflection of causing her misery will be sufficient to overpower me
to call sophia mine is the greatest and now the only additional blessing which heaven can bestow but it is a blessing which i must owe to her alone i will not flatter you child cries allworthy i fear your case is desperate i never saw stronger marks of an unalterable resolution in any person than appeared in her vehement declarations against receiving your addresses for which perhaps you can account better than myself oh sir
i can account too well answered jones i have sinned against her beyond all hope of pardon and guilty as i am my guilt unfortunately appears to her in ten times blacker than the real colours
o my dear uncle
i find my follies are irretrievable and all your goodness cannot save me from perdition  a servant now acquainted them that mr western was belowstairs for his eagerness to see jones could not wait till the afternoon
upon which jones whose eyes were full of tears begged his uncle to entertain western a few minutes till he a little recovered himself to which the good man consented and having ordered mr western to be shewn into a parlour went down to him
mrs miller no sooner heard that jones was alone for she had not yet seen him since his release from prison than she came eagerly into the room and advancing towards jones wished him heartily joy of his newfound uncle and his happy reconciliation adding i wish i could give you joy on another account my dear child but anything so inexorable i never saw  jones with some appearance of surprize asked her what she meant
why then says she i have been with your young lady and have explained all matters to her as they were told to me by my son nightingale
she can have no longer any doubt about the letter of that i am certain for i told her my son nightingale was ready to take his oath if she pleased that it was all his own invention and the letter of his inditing
i told her the very reason of sending the letter ought to recommend you to her the more as it was all upon her account and a plain proof that you was resolved to quit all your profligacy for the future that you had never been guilty of a single instance of infidelity to her since your seeing her in town i am afraid i went too far there but heaven forgive me
i hope your future behaviour will be my justification
i am sure i have said all i can but all to no purpose
she remains inflexible
she says she had forgiven many faults on account of youth but expressed such detestation of the character of a libertine that she absolutely silenced me
i often attempted to excuse you but the justness of her accusation flew in my face
upon my honour she is a lovely woman and one of the sweetest and most sensible creatures i ever saw
i could have almost kissed her for one expression she made use of
it was a sentiment worthy of seneca or of a bishop
i once fancied madam'
and she i had discovered great goodness of heart in mr jones and for that i own i had a sincere esteem but an entire profligacy of manners will corrupt the best heart in the world and all which a goodnatured libertine can expect is that we should mix some grains of pity with our contempt and abhorrence'
she is an angelic creature that is the truth on't o mrs miller answered jones can i bear to think that i have lost such an angel lost
no cries mrs miller i hope you have not lost her yet
resolve to leave such vicious courses and you may yet have hopes nay if she would remain inexorable there is another young lady a sweet pretty young lady and a swinging fortune who is absolutely dying for love of you
i heard of it this very morning and i told it to miss western nay i went a little beyond the truth again for i told her you had refused her but indeed i knew you would refuse her
and here i must give you a little comfort when i mentioned the young lady's name who is no other than the pretty widow hunt i thought she turned pale but when i said you had refused her i will be sworn her face was all over scarlet in an instant and these were her very words i will not deny but that i believe he has some affection for me
'  here the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of western who could no longer be kept out of the room even by the authority of allworthy himself though this as we have often seen had a wonderful power over him
western immediately went up to jones crying out my old friend tom i am glad to see thee with all my heart
all past must be forgotten i could not intend any affront to thee because as allworthy here knows nay dost know it thyself i took thee for another person and where a body means no harm what signifies a hasty word or two
one christian must forget and forgive another i hope sir said jones i shall never forget the many obligations i have had to you but as for any offence towards me i declare i am an utter stranger a't  says western then give me thy fist a't as hearty an honest cock as any in the kingdom
come along with me i'll carry thee to thy mistress this moment here allworthy interposed and the squire being unable to prevail either with the uncle or nephew was after some litigation obliged to consent to delay introducing jones to sophia till the afternoon at which time allworthy as well in compassion to jones as in compliance with the eager desires of western was prevailed upon to promise to attend at the teatable
the conversation which now ensued was pleasant enough and with which had it happened earlier in our history we would have entertained our reader but as we have now leisure only to attend to what is very material it shall suffice to say that matters being entirely adjusted as to the afternoon visit mr western again returned home
chapter xi
the history draws nearer to a conclusion
when mr western was departed jones began to inform mr allworthy and mrs miller that his liberty had been procured by two noble lords who together with two surgeons and a friend of mr nightingale's had attended the magistrate by whom he had been committed and by whom on the surgeons' oaths that the wounded person was out of all manner of danger from his wound he was discharged
one only of these lords he said he had ever seen before and that no more than once but the other had greatly surprized him by asking his pardon for an offence he had been guilty of towards him occasioned he said entirely by his ignorance who he was
now the reality of the case with which jones was not acquainted till afterwards was thisthe lieutenant whom lord fellamar had employed according to the advice of lady bellaston to press jones as a vagabond into the seaservice when he came to report to his lordship the event which we have before seen spoke very favourably of the behaviour of mr jones on all accounts and strongly assured that lord that he must have mistaken the person for that jones was certainly a gentleman insomuch that his lordship who was strictly a man of honour and would by no means have been guilty of an action which the world in general would have condemned began to be much concerned for the advice which he had taken
within a day or two after this lord fellamar happened to dine with the irish peer who in a conversation upon the duel acquainted his company with the character of fitzpatrick to which indeed he did not do strict justice especially in what related to his lady
he said she was the most innocent the most injured woman alive and that from compassion alone he had undertaken her cause
he then declared an intention of going the next morning to fitzpatrick's lodgings in order to prevail with him if possible to consent to a separation from his wife who the peer said was in apprehensions for her life if she should ever return to be under the power of her husband
lord fellamar agreed to go with him that he might satisfy himself more concerning jones and the circumstances of the duel for he was by no means easy concerning the part he had acted
the moment his lordship gave a hint of his readiness to assist in the delivery of the lady it was eagerly embraced by the other nobleman who depended much on the authority of lord fellamar as he thought it would greatly contribute to awe fitzpatrick into a compliance and perhaps he was in the right for the poor irishman no sooner saw these noble peers had undertaken the cause of his wife than he submitted and articles of separation were soon drawn up and signed between the parties
fitzpatrick who had been so well satisfied by mrs waters concerning the innocence of his wife with jones at upton or perhaps from some other reasons was now become so indifferent to that matter that he spoke highly in favour of jones to lord fellamar took all the blame upon himself and said the other had behaved very much like a gentleman and a man of honour and upon that lord's further enquiry concerning mr jones fitzpatrick told him he was nephew to a gentleman of very great fashion and fortune which was the account he had just received from mrs waters after her interview with dowling
lord fellamar now thought it behoved him to do everything in his power to make satisfaction to a gentleman whom he had so grossly injured and without any consideration of rivalship for he had now given over all thoughts of sophia determined to procure mr jones's liberty being satisfied as well from fitzpatrick as his surgeon that the wound was not mortal
he therefore prevailed with the irish peer to accompany him to the place where jones was confined to whom he behaved as we have already related
when allworthy returned to his lodgings he immediately carried jones into his room and then acquainted him with the whole matter as well what he had heard from mrs waters as what he had discovered from mr dowling
jones expressed great astonishment and no less concern at this account but without making any comment or observation upon it
and now a message was brought from mr blifil desiring to know if his uncle was at leisure that he might wait upon him
allworthy started and turned pale and then in a more passionate tone than i believe he had ever used before bid the servant tell blifil he knew him not
consider dear sir cries jones in a trembling voice
i have considered answered allworthy and you yourself shall carry my message to the villain
no one can carry him the sentence of his own ruin so properly as the man whose ruin he hath so villanously contrived pardon me dear sir said jones a moment's reflection will i am sure convince you of the contrary
what might perhaps be but justice from another tongue would from mine be insult and to whommy own brother and your nephew
nor did he use me so barbarouslyindeed that would have been more inexcusable than anything he hath done
fortune may tempt men of no very bad dispositions to injustice but insults proceed only from black and rancorous minds and have no temptations to excuse them
let me beseech you sir to do nothing by him in the present height of your anger
consider my dear uncle i was not myself condemned unheard  allworthy stood silent a moment and then embracing jones he said with tears gushing from his eyes o my child
to what goodness have i been so long blind  mrs miller entering the room at that moment after a gentle rap which was not perceived and seeing jones in the arms of his uncle the poor woman in an agony of joy fell upon her knees and burst forth into the most ecstatic thanksgivings to heaven for what had happened then running to jones she embraced him eagerly crying my dearest friend i wish you joy a thousand and a thousand times of this blest day and next mr allworthy himself received the same congratulations
to which he answered indeed indeed mrs miller i am beyond expression happy some few more raptures having passed on all sides mrs miller desired them both to walk down to dinner in the parlour where she said there were a very happy set of people assembledbeing indeed no other than mr nightingale and his bride and his cousin harriet with her bridegroom
allworthy excused himself from dining with the company saying he had ordered some little thing for him and his nephew in his own apartment for that they had much private business to discourse of but would not resist promising the good woman that both he and jones would make part of her society at supper
mrs miller then asked what was to be done with blifil
for indeed  says she i cannot be easy while such a villain is in my houseallworthy answered he was as uneasy as herself on the same account oh cries she if that be the case leave the matter to me i'll soon show him the outside out of my doors i warrant you
here are two or three lusty fellows belowstairs there will be no need of any violence cries allworthy if you will carry him a message from me he will i am convinced depart of his own accord  will i said mrs miller i never did anything in my life with a better will here jones interfered and said he had considered the matter better and would if mr allworthy pleased be himself the messenger
i know says he already enough of your pleasure sir and i beg leave to acquaint him with it by my own words
let me beseech you sir added he to reflect on the dreadful consequences of driving him to violent and sudden despair
how unfit alas
is this poor man to die in his present situation this suggestion had not the least effect on mrs miller
she left the room crying you are too good mr jones infinitely too good to live in this world but it made a deeper impression on allworthy
my good child said he i am equally astonished at the goodness of your heart and the quickness of your understanding
heaven indeed forbid that this wretch should be deprived of any means or time for repentance
that would be a shocking consideration indeed
go to him therefore and use your own discretion yet do not flatter him with any hopes of my forgiveness for i shall never forgive villany farther than my religion obliges me and that extends not either to our bounty or our conversation  jones went up to blifil's room whom he found in a situation which moved his pity though it would have raised a less amiable passion in many beholders
he cast himself on his bed where he lay abandoning himself to despair and drowned in tears not in such tears as flow from contrition and wash away guilt from minds which have been seduced or surprized into it unawares against the bent of their natural dispositions as will sometimes happen from human frailty even to the good no these tears were such as the frighted thief sheds in his cart and are indeed the effects of that concern which the most savage natures are seldom deficient in feeling for themselves
it would be unpleasant and tedious to paint this scene in full length
let it suffice to say that the behaviour of jones was kind to excess
he omitted nothing which his invention could supply to raise and comfort the drooping spirits of blifil before he communicated to him the resolution of his uncle that he must quit the house that evening
he offered to furnish him with any money he wanted assured him of his hearty forgiveness of all he had done against him that he would endeavour to live with him hereafter as a brother and would leave nothing unattempted to effectuate a reconciliation with his uncle
blifil was at first sullen and silent balancing in his mind whether he should yet deny all but finding at last the evidence too strong against him he betook himself at last to confession
he then asked pardon of his brother in the most vehement manner prostrated himself on the ground and kissed his feet in short he was now as remarkably mean as he had been before remarkably wicked
jones could not so far check his disdain but that it a little discovered itself in his countenance at this extreme servility
he raised his brother the moment he could from the ground and advised him to bear his afflictions more like a man repeating at the same time his promises that he would do all in his power to lessen them for which blifil making many professions of his unworthiness poured forth a profusion of thanks and then he having declared he would immediately depart to another lodging jones returned to his uncle
among other matters allworthy now acquainted jones with the discovery which he had made concerning the  banknotes
i have said he already consulted a lawyer who tells me to my great astonishment that there is no punishment for a fraud of this kind
indeed when i consider the black ingratitude of this fellow toward you i think a highwayman compared to him is an innocent person  good heaven says jones is it possiblei am shocked beyond measure at this news
i thought there was not an honester fellow in the worldthe temptation of such a sum was too great for him to withstand for smaller matters have come safe to me through his hand
indeed my dear uncle you must suffer me to call it weakness rather than ingratitude for i am convinced the poor fellow loves me and hath done me some kindnesses which i can never forget nay i believe he hath repented of this very act for it is not above a day or two ago when my affairs seemed in the most desperate situation that he visited me in my confinement and offered me any money i wanted
consider sir what a temptation to a man who hath tasted such bitter distress it must be to have a sum in his possession which must put him and his family beyond any future possibility of suffering the like  child cries allworthy you carry this forgiving temper too far
such mistaken mercy is not only weakness but borders on injustice and is very pernicious to society as it encourages vice
the dishonesty of this fellow i might perhaps have pardoned but never his ingratitude
and give me leave to say when we suffer any temptation to atone for dishonesty itself we are as candid and merciful as we ought to be and so far i confess i have gone for i have often pitied the fate of a highwayman when i have been on the grand jury and have more than once applied to the judge on the behalf of such as have had any mitigating circumstances in their case but when dishonesty is attended with any blacker crime such as cruelty murder ingratitude or the like compassion and forgiveness then become faults
i am convinced the fellow is a villain and he shall be punished at least as far as i can punish him  this was spoken with so stern a voice that jones did not think proper to make any reply besides the hour appointed by mr western now drew so near that he had barely time left to dress himself
here therefore ended the present dialogue and jones retired to another room where partridge attended according to order with his cloaths
partridge had scarce seen his master since the happy discovery
the poor fellow was unable either to contain or express his transports
he behaved like one frantic and made almost as many mistakes while he was dressing jones as i have seen made by harlequin in dressing himself on the stage
his memory however was not in the least deficient
he recollected now many omens and presages of this happy event some of which he had remarked at the time but many more he now remembered nor did he omit the dreams he had dreamt the evening before his meeting with jones and concluded with saying i always told your honour something boded in my mind that you would one time or other have it in your power to make my fortune jones assured him that this boding should as certainly be verified with regard to him as all the other omens had been to himself which did not a little add to all the raptures which the poor fellow had already conceived on account of his master
chapter xii
approaching still nearer to the end
jones being now completely dressed attended his uncle to mr western's
he was indeed one of the finest figures ever beheld and his person alone would have charmed the greater part of womankind but we hope it hath already appeared in this history that nature when she formed him did not totally rely as she sometimes doth on this merit only to recommend her work
sophia who angry as she was was likewise set forth to the best advantage for which i leave my female readers to account appeared so extremely beautiful that even allworthy when he saw her could not forbear whispering western that he believed she was the finest creature in the world
to which western answered in a whisper overheard by all present so much the better for tomfor dn me if he shan't ha the tousling her sophia was all over scarlet at these words while tom's countenance was altogether as pale and he was almost ready to sink from his chair
the teatable was scarce removed before western lugged allworthy out of the room telling him he had business of consequence to impart and must speak to him that instant in private before he forgot it
the lovers were now alone and it will i question not appear strange to many readers that those who had so much to say to one another when danger and difficulty attended their conversation and who seemed so eager to rush into each other's arms when so many bars lay in their way now that with safety they were at liberty to say or do whatever they pleased should both remain for some time silent and motionless insomuch that a stranger of moderate sagacity might have well concluded they were mutually indifferent but so it was however strange it may seem both sat with their eyes cast downwards on the ground and for some minutes continued in perfect silence
mr jones during this interval attempted once or twice to speak but was absolutely incapable muttering only or rather sighing out some broken words when sophia at length partly out of pity to him and partly to turn the discourse from the subject which she knew well enough he was endeavouring to open said  sure sir you are the most fortunate man in the world in this discovery and can you really madam think me so fortunate said jones sighing while i have incurred your displeasurenay sir  says she as to that you best know whether you have deserved it  indeed madam answered he you yourself are as well apprized of all my demerits
mrs miller hath acquainted you with the whole truth
o
my sophia am i never to hope for forgivenessi think mr jones said she i may almost depend on your own justice and leave it to yourself to pass sentence on your own conductalas
madam  answered he it is mercy and not justice which i implore at your hands
justice i know must condemn meyet not for the letter i sent to lady bellaston
of that i most solemnly declare you have had a true account he then insisted much on the security given him by nightingale of a fair pretence for breaking off if contrary to their expectations her ladyship should have accepted his offer but confest that he had been guilty of a great indiscretion to put such a letter as that into her power which said he i have dearly paid for in the effect it has upon you i do not i cannot says she believe otherwise of that letter than you would have me
my conduct i think shews you clearly i do not believe there is much in that
and yet mr jones have i not enough to resent
after what past at upton so soon to engage in a new amour with another woman while i fancied and you pretended your heart was bleeding for me
indeed you have acted strangely
can i believe the passion you have profest to me to be sincere
or if i can what happiness can i assure myself of with a man capable of so much inconstancy o
my sophia cries he do not doubt the sincerity of the purest passion that ever inflamed a human breast
think most adorable creature of my unhappy situation of my despair
could i my sophia have flattered myself with the most distant hopes of being ever permitted to throw myself at your feet in the manner i do now it would not have been in the power of any other woman to have inspired a thought which the severest chastity could have condemned
inconstancy to you
o sophia
if you can have goodness enough to pardon what is past do not let any cruel future apprehensions shut your mercy against me
no repentance was ever more sincere
o
let it reconcile me to my heaven in this dear bosom  sincere repentance mr jones answered she will obtain the pardon of a sinner but it is from one who is a perfect judge of that sincerity
a human mind may be imposed on nor is there any infallible method to prevent it
you must expect however that if i can be prevailed on by your repentance to pardon you i will at least insist on the strongest proof of its sincerity name any proof in my power answered jones eagerly
time replied she time alone mr jones can convince me that you are a true penitent and have resolved to abandon these vicious courses which i should detest you for if i imagined you capable of persevering in them do not imagine it  cries jones
on my knees i intreat i implore your confidence a confidence which it shall be the business of my life to deserve let it then said she be the business of some part of your life to shew me you deserve it
i think i have been explicit enough in assuring you that when i see you merit my confidence you will obtain it
after what is past sir can you expect i should take you upon your word  he replied don't believe me upon my word i have a better security a pledge for my constancy which it is impossible to see and to doubt what is that said sophia a little surprized
i will show you my charming angel cried jones seizing her hand and carrying her to the glass
there behold it there in that lovely figure in that face that shape those eyes that mind which shines through these eyes can the man who shall be in possession of these be inconstant
impossible
my sophia they would fix a dorimant a lord rochester
you could not doubt it if you could see yourself with any eyes but your own sophia blushed and half smiled but forcing again her brow into a frownif i am to judge said she of the future by the past my image will no more remain in your heart when i am out of your sight than it will in this glass when i am out of the room by heaven by all that is sacred said jones it never was out of my heart
the delicacy of your sex cannot conceive the grossness of ours nor how little one sort of amour has to do with the heart i will never marry a man replied sophia very gravely who shall not learn refinement enough to be as incapable as i am myself of making such a distinction i will learn it said jones
i have learnt it already
the first moment of hope that my sophia might be my wife taught it me at once and all the rest of her sex from that moment became as little the objects of desire to my sense as of passion to my heart well says sophia the proof of this must be from time
your situation mr jones is now altered and i assure you i have great satisfaction in the alteration
you will now want no opportunity of being near me and convincing me that your mind is altered too o
my angel cries jones how shall i thank thy goodness
and are you so good to own that you have a satisfaction in my prosperitybelieve me believe me madam it is you alone have given a relish to that prosperity since i owe to it the dear hopeo
my sophia let it not be a distant onei will be all obedience to your commands
i will not dare to press anything further than you permit me
yet let me intreat you to appoint a short trial
o
tell me when i may expect you will be convinced of what is most solemnly true when i have gone voluntarily thus far mr jones  said she i expect not to be pressed
nay i will noto
don't look unkindly thus my sophia cries he
i do not i dare not press youyet permit me at least once more to beg you would fix the period
o
consider the impatience of lovea twelvemonth perhaps said she
o
my sophia cries he you have named an eternityperhaps it may be something sooner says she i will not be teazed
if your passion for me be what i would have it i think you may now be easyeasy
sophia call not such an exulting happiness as mine by so cold a nameo
transporting thought
am i not assured that the blessed day will come when i shall call you mine when fears shall be no more when i shall have that dear that vast that exquisite ecstatic delight of making my sophia happyindeed sir said she that day is in your own powero
my dear my divine angel cried he these words have made me mad with joybut i must i will thank those dear lips which have so sweetly pronounced my bliss he then caught her in his arms and kissed her with an ardour he had never ventured before
at this instant western who had stood some time listening burst into the room and with his hunting voice and phrase cried out to her boy to her go to herthat's it little honeys o that's it
well
what is it all over
hath she appointed the day boy
what shall it be tomorrow or next day
it shan't be put off a minute longer than next day i am resolved let me beseech you sir says jones don't let me be the occasionbeseech mine a cries western
i thought thou hadst been a lad of higher mettle than to give way to a parcel of maidenish tricksi tell thee 'tis all flimflam
zoodikers
she'd have the wedding tonight with all her heart
would'st not sophy
come confess and be an honest girl for once
what art dumb
why dost not speak why should i confess sir says sophia since it seems you are so well acquainted with my thoughtsthat's a good girl cries he and dost consent then  no indeed sir says sophia i have given no such consentand wunt not ha un then tomorrow nor next day says westernindeed sir says she i have no such intention but i can tell thee  replied he why hast nut only because thou dost love to be disobedient and to plague and vex thy father pray sir said jones interferingi tell thee thou art a puppy cries he
when i vorbid her then it was all nothing but sighing and whining and languishing and writing now i am vor thee she is against thee
all the spirit of contrary that's all
she is above being guided and governed by her father that is the whole truth on't
it is only to disoblige and contradict me what would my papa have me do cries sophia
what would i ha thee do says he why gi' un thy hand this momentwell sir says sophia i will obey youthere is my hand mr jones well and will you consent to ha un tomorrow morning says westerni will be obedient to you sir cries shewhy then tomorrow morning be the day cries he
why then tomorrow morning shall be the day papa since you will have it so  says sophia
jones then fell upon his knees and kissed her hand in an agony of joy while western began to caper and dance about the room presently crying outwhere the devil is allworthy
he is without now a talking with that dd lawyer dowling when he should be minding other matters he then sallied out in quest of him and very opportunely left the lovers to enjoy a few tender minutes alone
but he soon returned with allworthy saying if you won't believe me you may ask her yourself
hast nut gin thy consent sophy to be married tomorrow such are your commands sir cries sophia and i dare not be guilty of disobedience i hope madam cries allworthy my nephew will merit so much goodness and will be always as sensible as myself of the great honour you have done my family
an alliance with so charming and so excellent a young lady would indeed be an honour to the greatest in england yes cries western but if i had suffered her to stand shill i shall i dilly dally you might not have had that honour yet a while i was forced to use a little fatherly authority to bring her to i hope not sir cries allworthy i hope there is not the least constraint why there  cries western you may bid her unsay all again if you will
dost repent heartily of thy promise dost not sophia indeed papa  cries she i do not repent nor do i believe i ever shall of any promise in favour of mr jones then nephew cries allworthy i felicitate you most heartily for i think you are the happiest of men
and madam you will give me leave to congratulate you on this joyful occasion indeed i am convinced you have bestowed yourself on one who will be sensible of your great merit and who will at least use his best endeavours to deserve it his best endeavours cries western that he will i warrant unharkee allworthy i'll bet thee five pounds to a crown we have a boy tomorrow nine months but prithee tell me what wut ha
wut ha burgundy champaigne or what
for please jupiter we'll make a night on't indeed sir said allworthy you must excuse me both my nephew and i were engaged before i suspected this near approach of his happinessengaged quoth the squire never tell mei won't part with thee tonight upon any occasion
shalt sup here please the lord harry you must pardon me my dear neighbour answered allworthy i have given a solemn promise and that you know i never break why prithee who art engaged to  cries the squireallworthy then informed him as likewise of the companyodzookers answered the squire i will go with thee and so shall sophy
for i won't part with thee tonight and it would be barbarous to part tom and the girl this offer was presently embraced by allworthy and sophia consented having first obtained a private promise from her father that he would not mention a syllable concerning her marriage
chapter the last
in which the history is concluded
young nightingale had been that afternoon by appointment to wait on his father who received him much more kindly than he expected
there likewise he met his uncle who was returned to town in quest of his newmarried daughter
this marriage was the luckiest incident which could have happened to the young gentleman for these brothers lived in a constant state of contention about the government of their children both heartily despising the method which each other took
each of them therefore now endeavoured as much as he could to palliate the offence which his own child had committed and to aggravate the match of the other
this desire of triumphing over his brother added to the many arguments which allworthy had used so strongly operated on the old gentleman that he met his son with a smiling countenance and actually agreed to sup with him that evening at mrs miller's
as for the other who really loved his daughter with the most immoderate affection there was little difficulty in inclining him to a reconciliation
he was no sooner informed by his nephew where his daughter and her husband were than he declared he would instantly go to her
and when he arrived there he scarce suffered her to fall upon her knees before he took her up and embraced her with a tenderness which affected all who saw him and in less than a quarter of an hour was as well reconciled to both her and her husband as if he had himself joined their hands
in this situation were affairs when mr allworthy and his company arrived to complete the happiness of mrs miller who no sooner saw sophia than she guessed everything that had happened and so great was her friendship to jones that it added not a few transports to those she felt on the happiness of her own daughter
there have not i believe been many instances of a number of people met together where every one was so perfectly happy as in this company
amongst whom the father of young nightingale enjoyed the least perfect content for notwithstanding his affection for his son notwithstanding the authority and the arguments of allworthy together with the other motive mentioned before he could not so entirely be satisfied with his son's choice and perhaps the presence of sophia herself tended a little to aggravate and heighten his concern as a thought now and then suggested itself that his son might have had that lady or some other such
not that any of the charms which adorned either the person or mind of sophia created the uneasiness it was the contents of her father's coffers which set his heart a longing
these were the charms which he could not bear to think his son had sacrificed to the daughter of mrs miller
the brides were both very pretty women but so totally were they eclipsed by the beauty of sophia that had they not been two of the besttempered girls in the world it would have raised some envy in their breasts for neither of their husbands could long keep his eyes from sophia who sat at the table like a queen receiving homage or rather like a superior being receiving adoration from all around her
but it was an adoration which they gave not which she exacted for she was as much distinguished by her modesty and affability as by all her other perfections
the evening was spent in much true mirth
all were happy but those the most who had been most unhappy before
their former sufferings and fears gave such a relish to their felicity as even love and fortune in their fullest flow could not have given without the advantage of such a comparison
yet as great joy especially after a sudden change and revolution of circumstances is apt to be silent and dwells rather in the heart than on the tongue jones and sophia appeared the least merry of the whole company which western observed with great impatience often crying out to them why dost not talk boy
why dost look so grave
hast lost thy tongue girl
drink another glass of wine sha't drink another glass and the more to enliven her he would sometimes sing a merry song which bore some relation to matrimony and the loss of a maidenhead
nay he would have proceeded so far on that topic as to have driven her out of the room if mr allworthy had not checkt him sometimes by looks and once or twice by a fie
mr western he began indeed once to debate the matter and assert his right to talk to his own daughter as he thought fit but as nobody seconded him he was soon reduced to order
notwithstanding this little restraint he was so pleased with the chearfulness and goodhumour of the company that he insisted on their meeting the next day at his lodgings
they all did so and the lovely sophia who was now in private become a bride too officiated as the mistress of the ceremonies or in the polite phrase did the honours of the table
she had that morning given her hand to jones in the chapel at doctors'commons where mr allworthy mr western and mrs miller were the only persons present
sophia had earnestly desired her father that no others of the company who were that day to dine with him should be acquainted with her marriage
the same secrecy was enjoined to mrs miller and jones undertook for allworthy
this somewhat reconciled the delicacy of sophia to the public entertainment which in compliance with her father's will she was obliged to go to greatly against her own inclinations
in confidence of this secrecy she went through the day pretty well till the squire who was now advanced into the second bottle could contain his joy no longer but filling out a bumper drank a health to the bride
the health was immediately pledged by all present to the great confusion of our poor blushing sophia and the great concern of jones upon her account
to say truth there was not a person present made wiser by this discovery for mrs miller had whispered it to her daughter her daughter to her husband her husband to his sister and she to all the rest
sophia now took the first opportunity of withdrawing with the ladies and the squire sat in to his cups in which he was by degrees deserted by all the company except the uncle of young nightingale who loved his bottle as well as western himself
these two therefore sat stoutly to it during the whole evening and long after that happy hour which had surrendered the charming sophia to the eager arms of her enraptured jones
thus reader we have at length brought our history to a conclusion in which to our great pleasure though contrary perhaps to thy expectation mr jones appears to be the happiest of all humankind for what happiness this world affords equal to the possession of such a woman as sophia i sincerely own i have never yet discovered
as to the other persons who have made any considerable figure in this history as some may desire to know a little more concerning them we will proceed in as few words as possible to satisfy their curiosity
allworthy hath never yet been prevailed upon to see blifil but he hath yielded to the importunity of jones backed by sophia to settle  ayear upon him to which jones hath privately added a third
upon this income he lives in one of the northern counties about  miles distant from london and lays up  ayear out of it in order to purchase a seat in the next parliament from a neighbouring borough which he has bargained for with an attourney there
he is also lately turned methodist in hopes of marrying a very rich widow of that sect whose estate lies in that part of the kingdom
square died soon after he writ the beforementioned letter and as to thwackum he continues at his vicarage
he hath made many fruitless attempts to regain the confidence of allworthy or to ingratiate himself with jones both of whom he flatters to their faces and abuses behind their backs
but in his stead mr allworthy hath lately taken mr abraham adams into his house of whom sophia is grown immoderately fond and declares he shall have the tuition of her children
mrs fitzpatrick is separated from her husband and retains the little remains of her fortune
she lives in reputation at the polite end of the town and is so good an economist that she spends three times the income of her fortune without running into debt
she maintains a perfect intimacy with the lady of the irish peer and in acts of friendship to her repays all obligations she owes her husband
mrs western was soon reconciled to her niece sophia and hath spent two months together with her in the country
lady bellaston made the latter a formal visit at her return to town where she behaved to jones as a perfect stranger and with great civility wished him joy on his marriage
mr nightingale hath purchased an estate for his son in the neighbourhood of jones where the young gentleman his lady mrs miller and her little daughter reside and the most agreeable intercourse subsists between the two families
as to those of lower account mrs waters returned into the country had a pension of  ayear settled upon her by mr allworthy and is married to parson supple on whom at the instance of sophia western hath bestowed a considerable living
black george hearing the discovery that had been made ran away and was never since heard of and jones bestowed the money on his family but not in equal proportions for molly had much the greatest share
as for partridge jones hath settled  ayear on him and he hath again set up a school in which he meets with much better encouragement than formerly and there is now a treaty of marriage on foot between him and miss molly seagrim which through the mediation of sophia is likely to take effect
we now return to take leave of mr jones and sophia who within two days after their marriage attended mr western and mr allworthy into the country
western hath resigned his family seat and the greater part of his estate to his soninlaw and hath retired to a lesser house of his in another part of the country which is better for hunting
indeed he is often as a visitant with mr jones who as well as his daughter hath an infinite delight in doing everything in their power to please him
and this desire of theirs is attended with such success that the old gentleman declares he was never happy in his life till now
he hath here a parlour and antechamber to himself where he gets drunk with whom he pleases and his daughter is still as ready as formerly to play to him whenever he desires it for jones hath assured her that as next to pleasing her one of his highest satisfactions is to contribute to the happiness of the old man so the great duty which she expresses and performs to her father renders her almost equally dear to him with the love which she bestows on himself
sophia hath already produced him two fine children a boy and a girl of whom the old gentleman is so fond that he spends much of his time in the nursery where he declares the tattling of his little granddaughter who is above a year and a half old is sweeter music than the finest cry of dogs in england
allworthy was likewise greatly liberal to jones on the marriage and hath omitted no instance of shewing his affection to him and his lady who love him as a father
whatever in the nature of jones had a tendency to vice has been corrected by continual conversation with this good man and by his union with the lovely and virtuous sophia
he hath also by reflection on his past follies acquired a discretion and prudence very uncommon in one of his lively parts
to conclude as there are not to be found a worthier man and woman than this fond couple so neither can any be imagined more happy
they preserve the purest and tenderest affection for each other an affection daily encreased and confirmed by mutual endearments and mutual esteem
nor is their conduct towards their relations and friends less amiable than towards one another
and such is their condescension their indulgence and their beneficence to those below them that there is not a neighbour a tenant or a servant who doth not most gratefully bless the day when mr jones was married to his sophia
finis
