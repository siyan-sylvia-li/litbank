chapter i
the coming of a native son  the happy family waiting for the sunday supper call were grouped around the open door of the bunkhouse gossiping idly of things purely local when the old man returned from the stock association at helena beside him on the buggy seat sat a stranger
the old man pulled up at the bunkhouse the stranger sprang out over the wheel with the agility which bespoke youthful muscles and the old man introduced him with a quirk of the lips  this is mr miguell rapponi boysa peeler straight from the golden gate
throw out your warbag and make yourself to home miguell some of the boys'll show you where to bed down  the old man drove on to the house with his own luggage and happy jack followed to take charge of the team but the remainder of the happy family unobtrusively took the measure of the foreign element
from his blackandwhite horsehair hatband with tassels that swept to the very edge of his gray hatbrim to the crimson silk neckerchief draped over the pale blue bosom of his shirt from the beautifully stamped leather cuffs down to the exaggerated height of his tan bootheels their critical eyes swept in swift appraising glances and unanimous disapproval was the result
the happy family had themselves an eye to picturesque garb upon occasion but this passed even pink's love of display
he's some gaudy to look at irish murmured under his breath to cal emmett
all he lacks is a spotlight and a brass band cal returned in much the same tone with which a woman remarks upon a last season's hat on the head of a rival
miguel was not embarrassed by the inspection
he was tall straight and swarthily handsome and he stood with the complacence of a stage favorite waiting for the applause to cease so that he might speak his first lines and while he waited he sifted tobacco into a cigarette paper daintily with his little finger extended
there was a ring upon that finger a ring with a moonstone setting as large and round as the eye of a startled cat and the happy family caught the pale gleam of it and drew a long breath
he lighted a match nonchalantly by the artfully simple method of pinching the head of it with his fingernails leaned negligently against the wall of the bunkhouse and regarded the group incuriously while he smoked
any pretty girls up this way he inquired languidly after a moment fanning a thin smokecloud from before his face while he spoke
the happy family went prickly hot
the girls in that neighborhood were held in esteem and there was that in his tone which gave offense
sure there's pretty girls here big medicine bellowed unexpectedly close beside him
we're all of us engaged to em by cripes  miguel shot an oblique glance at big medicine examined the end of his cigarette and gave a lift of shoulder which might mean anything or nothing and so was irritating to a degree
he did not pursue the subject further and so several belated retorts were left tickling futilely the tongues of the happy familywhich does not make for amiability
to a man they liked him little in spite of their easy friendliness with mankind in general
at supper they talked with him perfunctorily and covertly sneered because he sprinkled his food liberally with cayenne and his speech with spanish words pronounced with soft slurred vowels that made them sound unfamiliar and against which his english contrasted sharply with its crisp american enunciation
he met their infrequent glances with the cool stare of absolute indifference to their opinion of him and their perfunctory civility with introspective calm
the next morning when there was riding to be done and miguel appeared at the last moment in his working clothes even weary the sunnyhearted had an unmistakable curl of his lip after the first glance
miguel wore the hatband the crimson kerchief tied loosely with the point draped over his chest the stamped leather cuffs and the tan boots with the highest heels ever built by the cobbler craft
also the lower half of him was incased in chaps the like of which had never before been brought into flying u coulee
black angora chaps they were longhaired crinkly to the very hide with three white diamondshaped patches running down each leg of them and with the leather waistband stamped elaborately to match the cuffs
the bands of his spurs were two inches wide and inlaid to the edge with beaten silver and each concho was engraved to represent a large wild rose with a golden center
a dollar laid upon the rowels would have left a fringe of prongs all around
he bent over his sacked riding outfit and undid it revealing a wonderful saddle of stamped leather inlaid on skirt and cantle with more beaten silver
he straightened the skirts carefully ignoring the glances thrown in his direction and swore softly to himself when he discovered where the leather had been scratched through the canvas wrappings and the end of the silver scroll ripped up
he drew out his bridle and shook it into shape and the silver mountings and the reins of braided leather with horsehair tassels made happy jack's eyes greedy with desire
his blanket was a scarlet navajo and his rope a rawhide lariat
altogether his splendor when he was mounted so disturbed the fine mental poise of the happy family that they left him jingling richly off by himself while they rode closely grouped and discussed him acrimoniously
by gosh a man might do worse than locate that native son for a silver mine cal began eyeing the interloper scornfully
it's plumb wicked to ride around with all that wealth and fussy stuff
he must 'a' robbed a bank and put the money all into a riding outfit  by golly he looks to me like a pair uh trays when he comes bowleggin' along with them white diamonds on his legs slim stated solemnly
and i'll gamble that's a spot higher than he stacks up in the cow game pink observed with the pessimism which matrimony had given him
you mind him asking about bad horses last night
that lizzieboy never saw a bad horse they don't grow 'em where he come from
what they don't know about riding they make up for with a swell rig  and oh mamma
it sure is a swell rig weary paid generous tribute
only i will say old banjo reminds me of an irish cook rigged out in silk and diamonds
that outfit on glory now he sighed enviously
well i've gone up against a few real ones in my long and varied career irish remarked reminiscently and i've noticed that a hoss never has any respect or admiration for a swell rig
when he gets real busy it ain't the silver filigree stuff that's going to help you hold connections with your saddle and a silvermounted bridlebit ain't a darned bit better than a plain one  just take a look at him cried pink with intense disgust
ambling off there so the sun can strike all that silver and bounce back in our eyes
and that braided lariati'd sure love to see the pieces if he ever tries to anchor anything bigger than a yearling  why you don't think for a minute he could ever get out and rope anything do yuh irish laughed
that there native son throws on awltogether too much dog to really get out and do anything  aw fleered happy jack he ain't any natiff son
he's a dago  he's got the earmarks uh both big medicine stated authoritatively
i know 'em by cripes and i know their ways he jerked his thumb toward the dazzling miguel
i can tell yuh the kinda cowpuncher he is i've saw 'em workin' at it
hawhawhaw
they'll start out to move ten or a dozen head uh tame old cows from one field to another and there'll be six or eight fellers rigged up like this here trayspot ridin' along important as hell drivin' them few cows down a lane with peach trees on both sides by cripes jingling their big silver spurs all wearin' fancy chaps to ride four or five miles down the road
honest to grandma they call that punchin' cows
oh he's a native son all right
i've saw lots of 'em only i never saw one so far away from the promised land before
that there looks queer to me
natiff sonsthe real ones like himare as scarce outside calyforny as buffalo are right here in this coulee  that's the way they do it all right irish agreed
and then they'll have a 'rodeo'  hawhawhaw big medicine interrupted and took up the tale which might have been entitled some cowpunching i have seen  they have them rodeos on a sunday mostly and they invite everybody to it like it was a picnic
and there'll be two or three fellers to every calf all lit up like miguell over there in chaps and silver fixin's fussin' around on horseback in a corral and every feller trying to pile his rope on the same calf by cripes
they stretch 'em out with two ropescalves remember
little weenty fellers you could pack under one arm
yuh can't blame 'em much
they never have more'n thirty or forty head to brand at a time and they never git more'n a taste uh real work
so they make the most uh what they git and go in heavy on fancy outfits
and this here silvermounted fellow thinks he's a real cowpuncher by cripes  the happy family laughed at the idea laughed so loud that miguel left his lonely splendor and swung over to them ostensibly to borrow a match
what's the joke he inquired languidly his chin thrust out and his eyes upon the match blazing at the end of his cigarette
the happy family hesitated and glanced at one another
then cal spoke truthfully
you're it he said bluntly with a secret desire to test the temper of this darkskinned son of the west
miguel darted one of his swift glances at cal blew out his match and threw it away
oh how funny
haha his voice was soft and absolutely expressionless his face blank of any emotion whatever
he merely spoke the words as a machine might have done
if he had been one of them the happy family would have laughed at the whimsical humor of it
as it was they repressed the impulse though weary warmed toward him slightly
don't you believe anything this innocenteyed gazabo tells you mr rapponi he warned amiably
he's known to be a liar  that's funny too
haha some more miguel permitted a thin ribbon of smoke to slide from between his lips and gazed off to the crinkled line of hills
sure it isnow you mention it weary agreed after a perceptible pause
how fortunate that i brought the humor to your attention drawled miguel in the same expressionless tone much as if he were reciting a text
virtue is its own penalty paraphrased pink not stopping to see whether the statement applied to the subject
hawhawhaw roared big medicine quite as irrelevantly
hehehe supplemented the silvertrimmed one
big medicine stopped laughing suddenly reined his horse close to the other and stared at him challengingly with his pale protruding eyes while the happy family glanced meaningly at one another
big medicine was quite as unsafe as he looked at that moment and they wondered if the offender realized his precarious situation
miguel smoked with the infinite leisure which is a fine art when it is not born of genuine abstraction and none could decide whether he was aware of the unfriendly proximity of big medicine
weary was just on the point of saying something to relieve the tension when miguel blew the ash gently from his cigarette and spoke lazily
parrots are so common out on the coast that they use them in cheap restaurants for stew
i've often heard them gabbling together in the kettle  the statement was so ambiguous that the happy family glanced at him doubtfully
big medicine's stare became more curious than hostile and he permitted his horse to lag a length
it is difficult to fight absolute passivity
then slim who ever tramped solidly over the flowers of sarcasm blurted one of his unexpected retorts
i was just wonderin' by golly where yuh learnt to talk  miguel turned his velvet eyes sleepily toward the speaker
from the boarders who ate those parrots amigo he smiled serenely
at this slimonce justly accused by irish of being a singleshot  when it came to reparteeturned purple and dumb
the happy family forswearing loyalty in their enjoyment of his discomfiture grinned and left to miguel the barren triumph of the last word
he did not gain in popularity as the days passed
they tilted noses at his beautiful riding gear and would have died rather than speak of it in his presence
they never gossiped with him of horses or men or the lands he knew
they were ready to snub him at a moment's noticeand it did not lessen their dislike of him that he failed to yield them an opportunity
it is to be hoped that he found his thoughts sufficient entertainment since he was left to them as much as is humanly possible when half a dozen men eat and sleep and work together
it annoyed them exceedingly that miguel did not seem to know that they held him at a distance they objected to his manner of smoking cigarettes and staring off at the skyline as if he were alone and content with his dreams
when he did talk they listened with an air of weary tolerance
when he did not talk they ignored his presence and when he was absent they criticized him mercilessly
they let him ride unwarned into an adobe patch one dayat least big medicine pink cal emmett and irish did for they were with himand laughed surreptitiously together while he wallowed there and came out afoot his horse floundering behind him mud to the ears both of them
pretty soft going along there ain't it pink commiserated deceitfully
it is kinda miguel responded evenly scraping the adobe off banjo with a flat rock
and the subject was closed
well it's some relief to the eyes to have the shine taken off him anyway pink observed a little guiltily afterward
i betche he ain't goin' to forget that though happy jack warned when he saw the caked mud on miguel's angora chaps and silver spurs and the condition of his saddle
yuh better watch out and not turn your backs on him in the dark none uh you guys
i betche he packs a knife
them kind always does  hawhawhaw bellowed big medicine uproariously
i'd love to see him git out an' try to use it by cripes  i wish andy was here pink sighed
andy'd take the starch outa him all right  wouldn't he be pickings for old andy though
gee cal looked around at them with his wide babyblue eyes and laughed
let's kinda jolly him along boys till andy gets back
it sure would be great to watch 'em
i'll bet he can jar the eternal calm outa that native son
that's what grinds me worse than his throwin' on so much dog he's so blamed satisfied with himself
you snub him and he looks at yuh as if you was his hired manand then forgets all about yuh
he come outa that 'doby like he'd been swimmin' a river on a bet and had made good and was a heero right before the ladies
kinda 'oh that's nothing to what i could do if it was worth while' way he had with him  it wouldn't matter so much if he wasn't all front pink complained
you'll notice that's always the way though
the fellow all fussed up with silver and braided leather can't get out and do anything
i remember up on milk river pink trailed off into absorbing reminiscence which however is too lengthy to repeat here
say miguell's down at the stable sweatin from every pore trying to get his saddle clean by golly slim reported cheerfully just as pink was relighting the cigarette which had gone out during the big scene of his story
he was cussin' in spanish when i walked up to himbut he shut up when he seen me and got that peaceful look uh hisn on his face
i wonder by golly  oh shut up and go awn irish commanded bluntly and looked at pink
did he call it off then
or did you have to wade in  naw he was like this here native sonall front
he could look sudden death all right he had black eyes like miguellbut all a fellow had to do was go after him and he'd back up so blamed quick  slim listened that far saw that he had interrupted a tale evidently more interesting than anything he could say and went off muttering to himself
chapter ii
when greek meets greek  the next morning which was sunday the machinations of big medicine took pink down to the creek behind the bunkhouse
what's hurtin' yuh  he asked curiously when he came to where big medicine stood in the fringe of willows choking between his spasms of mirth
hawhawhaw roared big medicine and seizing pink's arm in a gorillalike grip he pointed down the bank
miguel seated upon a convenient rock in a sunny spot was painstakingly combing out the tangled hair of his chaps which he had washed quite as carefully not long before as the cake of soap beside him testified
combingcombinghis chaps by cripes big medicine gasped and waggled his finger at the spectacle
hawhawhaw
ccombin'hischaps  miguel glanced up at them as impersonally as if they were two cackling hens rather than derisive humans then bent his head over a stubborn knot and whistled la paloma softly while he coaxed out the tangle
pink's eyes widened as he looked but he did not say anything
he backed up the path and went thoughtfully to the corrals leaving big medicine to follow or not as he chose
combin'his chaps by cripes came rumbling behind him
pink turned
say
don't make so much noise about it he advised guardedly
i've got an idea  yuh want to hogtie it then big medicine retorted resentful because pink seemed not to grasp the full humor of the thing
idees sure seems to be skurce in this outfitor that there lilyuhthevalley couldn't set and comb no chaps in broad daylight by cripes not and get off with it  he's an ornament to the flying u pink stated dreamily
us boneheads don't appreciate him is all that ails us
what we ought to do ishelp him be as pretty as he wants to be and  looky here little one big medicine hurried his steps until he was close alongside
i wouldn't give a punched nickel for a fourhorse load uh them idees and that's the truth he passed pink and went on ahead disgust in every line of his squareshouldered figure
combin' his chaps by cripes he snorted again and straightway told the tale profanely to his fellows who laughed until they were weak and wateryeyed as they listened
afterward because pink implored them and made a mystery of it they invited miguel to take a hand in a longwinded gamerather a series of gamesof sevenup while his chaps hung to dry upon a willow by the creek bankor so he believed
the chaps however were up in the whitehouse kitchen where were also the reek of scorched hair and the laughing expostulations of the little doctor and the boyish titter of pink and irish who were curling laboriously the chaps of miguel with the curling tongs of the little doctor and those of the countess besides
it's a shame and i just hope miguel thrashes you both for it the little doctor told them more than once but she laughed nevertheless and showed pink how to give the twist which made of each lock a corkscrew ringlet
the countess stopped with her dishcloth dangling from one red bony hand while she looked
you boys couldn't sleep nights if you didn't pester the life outa somebody she scolded
seems to me i'd friz them diamonds if i was goin' to be mean enough to do anything  you would eh pink glanced up at her and dimpled
i'll find you a rich husband to pay for that he straightway proceeded to friz the diamonds of white
why don't you have a strip of ringlets down each leg with tight little curls between suggested the little doctor not to be outdone by any other woman
correct you are praised irish
and remember you're not heating brandingirons mister man she added
you'll burn all the hair off if you let the tongs get redhot
just so they'll sizzle i've told you five times already she picked up the kid kissed many times the finger he held up for sympathythe finger with which he had touched the tongs as pink was putting them back into the grate of the kitchen stove and spoke again to ease her conscience
i think it's awfully mean of you to do it
miguel ought to thrash you both  we're dead willing to let him try mrs chip
we know it's mean
we're real ashamed of ourselves irish tested his tongs as he had been told to do
but we'd rather be ashamed than good any old time  the little doctor giggled behind the kid's tousled curls and reached out a slim hand once more to give pink's tongs the expert twist he was trying awkwardly to learn
i'm sorry for miguel he's got lovely eyes anyway  yes ain't he pink looked up briefly from his task
how's your leg irish
mine's done  seems to me i'd make a deep border of them corkscrew curls all around the bottoms if i was doin' it said the countess peevishly from the kitchen sink
if i was that dago i'd murder the hull outfit i never did see a body so hectored in my lifeand him not ever ketchin' on
he must be plumb simpleminded  when the curling was done to the hilarious satisfaction of irish and pink and while pink was dancing in them to show them off another entered with mail from town
and because the mailbearer was andy green himself back from a winter's journeyings cal happy jack and slim followed close behind talking all at once in their joy at beholding the man they loved well and hated occasionally also
andy delivered the mail into the hands of the little doctor pinched the kid's cheek and said how he had grown goodlooking as his mother almost spoke a cheerful howdy to the countess and turned to shake hands with pink
it was then that the honest gray eyes of him widened with amazement
well by golly gasped slim goggling at the chaps of miguel
that there natiff son'll just about kill yuh for that warned happy jack as mournfully as he might with laughing
he'll knife yuh sure  andy demanding the meaning of it all learned all about miguel rapponifrom the viewpoint of the happy family
at least he learned as much as it was politic to tell in the presence of the little doctor and afterward while pink was putting the chaps back upon the willow where miguel had left them he was told that they looked to him andy green for assistance
oh gosh
you don't want to depend on me pink andy expostulated modestly
i can't think of anythingand besides i've reformed
i don't know as it's any compliment to me by graciousbeing told soon as i land that i'm expected to lie to a perfect stranger  you come on down to the stable and take a look at his saddle and bridle urged cal
and wait till you see him smoking and looking past you as if you was an ornery little peak that didn't do nothing but obstruct the scenery
i've seen mean cusseslots of 'em and i've seen men that was stuck on themselves
but i never  come outa that 'doby pink interrupted mud to his eyebrows just about
and he knew darned well we headed him in there deliberate
and when i remarks it's soft going he says 'it is kinda'just like that pink managed to imitate the languid tone of miguel very well
not another word outa him
didn't even make him mad
he  tell him about the parrots slim cal suggested soberly
but slim only turned purple at the memory and swore
old patsy sure has got it in for him happy jack observed
he asked patsy if he ever had enchiladas
patsy won't speak to him no more
he claims miguell insulted him
he told miguell  enchiladas are sure fine eating said andy
i took to 'em like a shebear to honey down in new mexico this winter
your native son is solid there all right  aw gwan
he ain't solid nowhere but in the head
maybe you'll love him to death when yuh see himchances is you will if you've took to eatin' dago grub  andy patted happy jack reassuringly on the shoulder
don't get excited he soothed
i'll put it all over the gentleman just to show my heart's in the right place
just this once though i've reformed
and i've got to have time to size him up
where do you keep him when he ain't in the show window he swung into step with pink
i'll tell you the truth he confided engagingly
any man that'll wear chaps like he's goteven leaving out the extra finish you fellows have given 'emhad ought to be taught a lesson he'll remember
he sure must be a tough proposition if the whole bunch of yuh have had to give him up
by gracious  we haven't tried pink defended
it kinda looked to us as if he was aiming to make us guy him so we didn't
we've left him strictly alone
todayhe glanced over his shoulder to where the becurled chaps swung comically from the willow branchtoday's the first time anybody's made a move
unless he added as an afterthought you count yesterday in the 'doby patchand even then we didn't tell him to ride into it we just let him do it  and kinda herded him over towards it cal amended slyly
can he ride asked andy going straight to the main point in the mind of a cowpuncher
weellhe hasn't been piled so far
but then pink qualified hastily he hasn't topped anything worse than crowhop
he ain't hard to ride
happy jack could  aw i'm gittin' good and sick of' hearin' that there tune happy growled indignantly
why don't you point out slim as the limit once in a while  come on down to the stable and let's talk it over andy suggested and led the way
what's his style anyway
mouthy or what  with four willing tongues to enlighten him it would be strange indeed if one so acute as andy green failed at last to have a very fair mental picture of miguel
he gazed thoughtfully at his boots laughed suddenly and slapped irish quite painfully upon the back
come on up and introduce me boys he said
we'll make this native son so hungry for homeyou watch me put it on the gentleman
only it does seem a shame to do it  no it ain't
if you'd been around him for two weeks you'd want to kill him just to make him take notice irish assured him
what gets me andy mused is why you fellows come crying to me for help
i should think the bunch of you ought to be able to handle one lone native son  aw you're the biggest liar and faker in the bunch is why happy jack blurted
oh i see andy hummed a little tune and pushed his hands deep into his pockets and at the corners of his lips there flickered a smile
the native son sat with his hat tilted slightly back upon his head and a cigarette between his lips and was reaching lazily for the trick which made the fourth game his when the group invaded the bunkhouse
he looked up indifferently swept andy's face and figure with a glance too impersonal to hold even a shade of curiosity and began rapidly shuffling his cards to count the points he had made
andy stopped short just inside the door and stared hard at miguel who gave no sign
he turned his honest gray eyes upon pink and irish accusinglywhereat they wondered greatly
your dealif you want to play drawled miguel and shoved his cards toward big medicine
but the boys were already uptilting chairs to grasp the quicker the outstretched hand of the prodigal so that miguel gathered up the cards evened their edges mechanically and deigned another glance at this stranger who was being welcomed so vociferously
also he sighed a bitfor even a languideyed stoic of a native son may feel the twinge of loneliness
andy shook hands all round swore amiably at weary and advanced finally upon miguel
you don't know me from adam's off ox he began genially but i know you all right all right
i hollered my head off with the rest of 'em when you played merry hell in that bullring last christmas
also i was part of your bodyguard when them greasers were trying to tickle you in the ribs with their knives in that dark alley
shake oldtimer
you done yourself proud and i'm glad to know yuh  miguel for the first time in two weeks permitted himself the luxury of an expressive countenance
he gave andy green one quick grateful lookand a smile the like of which made the happy family quiver inwardly with instinctive sympathy
so you were there too eh miguel exclaimed softly and rose to greet him
and that scrap in the alleywe sure had a hell of a time there for a few minutes didn't we
are you that tall fellow who kicked that squinteyed greaser in the stomach
muchos gracios senor
they were piling on me three deep right then and i always believed they'd have got me only for a tall vaquero i couldn't locate afterward he smiled again that wonderful smile which lighted the darkness of his eyes as with a flame and murmured a sentence or two in spanish
did you get the spurs me and my friends sent you afterward asked andy eagerly
we heard about the arizona boys giving you the saddleand we raked high and low for them spurs
and by gracious they were beauts toodid yuh get 'em  i wear them every day i ride answered miguel a peculiar caressing note in his voice
i didn't knowwe heard you had disappeared off the earth
why  miguel laughed outright
to fight a bull with bare hands is one thing amigo he said
to take a chance on getting a knife stuck in your back is another
those mexicansthey don't love the man who crosses the river and makes of their bullfights a plaything  that's right only i thought you being a  not a mexican miguel's voice sharpened a trifle
my father was spanish yes
my motherhis eyes flashed briefly at the faces of the gaping happy familymy mother was born in ireland  and that sure makes a hard combination to beat cried andy heartily
he looked at the othersat all that is save pink and irish who had disappeared
well boys i never thought i'd come home and find  miguel rapponi supplied the native son quickly
as well forget that other name
and he added with the shrug which the happy family had come to hate as well forget the story also
i am not hungry for the feel of a knife in my back he smiled again engagingly at andy green
it was astonishing how readily that smile had sprung to life with the warmth of a little friendship and how pleasant it was withal
just as you say andy agreed not trying to hide his admiration
i guess nobody's got a better right to holler for silence
butsay you sure delivered the goods old boy
you musta read about it you fellows about the american puncher that went over the line and rode one of their crack bulls all round the ring and then he stopped and looked apologetically at miguel in whose dark eyes there flashed a warning light
i clean forgot he confessed impulsively
this meeting you here unexpectedly like this has kinda got me rattled i guess
buti never saw yuh before in my life he declared emphatically
i don't know a darn thing aboutanything that ever happened in an alley in the city ofoh come on oldtimer let's talk about the weather or something safe  after that the boys of the flying u behaved very much as do children who have quarreled foolishly and are trying shamefacedly to reestablish friendly relations without the preliminary indignity of open repentance
they avoided meeting the velveteyed glances of miguel and at the same time they were plainly anxious to include him in their talk as if that had been their habit from the first
a difficult situation to meet even with the fine aplomb of the happy family to ease the awkwardness
later miguel went unobtrusively down to the creek after his chaps he did not get them just then but he stood for a long time hidden behind the willowfringe watching pink and irish feverishly combing out certain corkscrew ringlets and dampening their combs in the creek to facilitate the process of straightening certain patches of rebellious frizzes
miguel did not laugh aloud as big medicine had done
he stood until he wearied of the sight then lifted his shoulders in the gesture which may mean anything smiled and went his way
not until dusk did andy get a private word with him
when he did find him alone he pumped miguel's hand up and down and afterward clutched at the manger for support and came near strangling
miguel leaned beside him and smiled to himself
good team work old boy andy gasped at length in a whisper
best i ever saw in m'life impromptu on the spot like that
i saw you had the makings in you soon as i caught your eye
and the whole blame bunch fell for itwoooof he laid his face down again upon his folded arms and shook in all the long length of him
they had it coming said miguel softly with a peculiar relish
two whole weeks and never a friendly word from one of themoh hell  i knowi heard it all soon as i hit the ranch andy replied weakly standing up and wiping his eyes
i just thought i'd learn 'em a lessonand the way you played upsay my hat's off to you all right  one learns to seize opportunities without stuttering miguel observed calmlyand a queer look came into his eyes as they rested upon the face of andy
and if the chance comes i'll do as much for you
by the way did you see the saddle those arizona boys sent me
it's over here
it's a pippinalmost as fine as the spurs which i keep in the bunkhouse when they're not on my heels
and if i didn't say so before i'm sure glad to meet the man that helped me through that alley
that big fat devil would have landed me sure if you hadn't  ahwhat andy leaned and peered into the face of miguel his jaw hanging slack
you don't mean to tell meit's true  true
why i thought you were the fellow miguel faced him steadily
his eyes were frankly puzzled
i'll tell you the truth so help me andy said heavily
i don't know a darned thing about it only what i read in the papers
i spent the whole winter in colorado and wyoming
i was just joshing the boys  oh said miguel
they stood there in the dusk and silence for a space after which andy went forth into the night to meditate upon this thing
miguel stood and looked after him
he's the real goods when it comes to lyingbut there are others he said aloud and smiled a peculiar smile
but for all that he felt that he was going to like andy very much indeed
and since the happy family had shown a disposition to make him one of themselves he knew that he was going to become quite as foolishly attached to the flying u as was even slim confessedly the most rabid of partisans
in this wise did miguel rapponi then become a member of jim whitmore's happy family and play his part in the events which followed his adoption
chapter iii
bad news  andy green that honesteyed young man whom everyone loved but whom not a man believed save when he was indulging his love for more or less fantastic flights of the imagination pulled up on the brow of flying u coulee and stared somberly at the picture spread below him
on the porch of the white house the hammock swung gently under the weight of the little doctor who pushed her shippertoe mechanically against a post support at regular intervals while she read
on the steps the kid was crawling laboriously upward only to descend again quite as laboriously when he attained the top
one of the boys was just emerging from the blacksmith shop from the build of him andy knew it must be either weary or irish though it would take a much closer observation and some familiarity with the two to identify the man more exactly
in the corral were a swirl of horses and an overhanging cloud of dust with two or three figures discernible in the midst and away in the little pasture two other figures were galloping after a fleeing dozen of horses
while he looked old patsy came out of the messhouse and went with flapping floursack apron to the woodpile
peaceful it was and homelike and contentedly prosperous a little world tucked away in its hills with its own little triumphs and defeats its own heartaches and rejoicings a lucky little world because its triumphs had been satisfying its defeats small its heartaches brief and its rejoicings untainted with harassment or guilt
yet andy stared down upon it with a frown and when he twitched the reins and began the descent he sighed impatiently
past the stable he rode with scarcely a glance toward weary who shouted a casual hello at him from the corral through the big gate and up the trail to the white house and straight to the porch where the little doctor flipped a leaf of her magazine and glanced at him with a smile and the kid turned his plump body upon the middle step and wrinkled his nose in a smile of recognition while he threw out an arm in welcome and made a wobbling effort to get upon his feet
andy smiled at the kid but his smile did not reach his eyes and faded almost immediately
he glanced at the little doctor sent his horse past the steps and the kid and close to the railing so that he could lean and toss the mail into the little doctor's lap
there was a yellow envelope among the letters and her fingers singled it out curiously
andy folded his hands upon the saddlehorn and watched her frankly
must be from j g guessed the little doctor inserting a slim finger under the badly sealed flap
i've been wondering if he wasn't going to send some wordhe's been gone a weekbaby
he's right between your horse's legs andy
ohhbaby boy what won't you do next she scattered letters and papers from her lap and flew to the rescue
will he kick andy
you little ruffian she held out her arms coaxingly from the top of the steps and her face andy saw when he looked at her had lost some of its color
the horse is quiet enough he reassured her
but at the same time i wouldn't hand him out as a plaything for a kid he leaned cautiously and peered backward
ohdid you ever see such a child
come to mother baby her voice was becoming strained
the kid wrinkling his nose and jabbering unintelligibly at her so that four tiny teeth showed in his pink mouth moved farther backward and sat down violently under the horse's sweatroughened belly
he wriggled round so that he faced forward reached out gleefully caught the front fetlocks and cried dup while he pulled
the little doctor turned white
he's all right soothed andy and leaning with a twist of his slim body caught the kid firmly by the back of his pink dress and lifted him clear of danger
he came up with a red face tossed the kid into the eager arms of the little doctor and soothed his horse with soft words and a series of little slaps upon the neck
he was breathing unevenly because the kid had really been in rather a ticklish position but the little doctor had her face hidden on the baby's neck and did not see
where's chip andy turned to ride back to the stable glancing toward the telegram lying on the floor of the porch and from it his eyes went to the young woman trying to laugh away her trembling while she scolded adoringly her adventurous manchild
he was about to speak again but thought better of it and sighed
down at the stables somewherei don't know really the boys can tell you
mother's baby mustn't touch the naughty horses
naughty horses hurt mother's baby
make him cry  andy gave her a long look which had in it much pity and rode away
he knew what was in that telegram for the agent had told him when he hunted him up at rusty brown's and gave it to him and the horse of andy bore mute testimony to the speed with which he had brought it to the ranch
not until he had reached the coulee had he slackened his pace
he decided after that glance that he would not remind her that she had not read the telegram instead he thought he ought to find chip immediately and send him to her
chip was rummaging after something in the storehouse and when andy saw him there he dismounted and stood blotting out the light from the doorway
chip looked up said hello carelessly and flung an old slicker aside that he might search beneath it
back early aren't you  he asked for sake of saying something
andy's attitude was not as casual as he would have had it
say maybe you better go on up to the house he began diffidently
i guess your wife wants to see yuh maybe  just as a good wife should grinned chip
what's the matter
kid fall off the porch  nooi brought out a wire from chicago
it's from a doctor theresome hospital
theold man got hurt
one of them cussed automobiles knocked him down
they want you to come  chip had straightened up and was hooking at andy blankly
if you're just  honest andy asserted and flushed a little
i'll go tell some one to catch up the teamyou'll want to make that  i take it he added as chip went by him hastily i had the agent wire for sleeper berths on the  so  thanks
yes you have the team caught up andy chip was already well on his way to the house
andy waited till he saw the little doctor come hurriedly to the end of the porch overlooking the pathway with the telegram fluttering in her fingers and then led his horse down through the gate and to the stable
he yanked the saddle off turned the tired animal into a stall and went on to the corral where he leaned elbows on a warped rail and peered through at the turmoil within
close beside him stood weary with his loop dragging behind him waiting for a chance to throw it over the head of a buckskin threeyearold with black mane and tail
get in here and make a hand why don't you weary bantered his eye on the buckskin
good chance to make a 'rep' for yourself andy
gawd greased that buckskinhe sure can slide out from under a rope as easy  he broke off to flip the hoop dexterously forward had the reward of seeing the buckskin dodge backward so that the rope barely flicked him on the nose and drew in his rope disgustedly
come on andymy hands are up in the air i can't land himthat's the fourth throw  andy's interest in the buckskin however was scant
his face was sober his whole attitude one of extreme dejection
you got the tummyache pink inquired facetiously moving around so that he got a fair look at his face
nawhis girl's went back on him happy jack put in coiling his rope as he came up
oh shut up andy's voice was sharp with trouble
boys the old man'swell he's most likely dead by this time
i brought out a telegram  go on pink's eyes widened incredulously
don't you try that kind of a load andy green or i'll just about  oh you fellows make me sick andy took his elbows off the rail and stood straight
dammit the telegram's up at the housego and read it yourselves then  the three stared after him doubtfully fear struggling with the caution born of much experience
he don't act to me like he was putting up a josh weary stated uneasily after a minute of silence
run up to the house and find out cadwalloper
the old manoh good lord the tan on weary's face took a lighter tinge
scootit won't take but a minute to find out for sure
go on pink  so help me josephine i'll kill that same andy green if he's lied about it pink declared while he climbed the fence
in three minutes he was back and before he had said a word his face confirmed the bad news
their eyes besought him for details and he gave them jerkily
automobile run over him
he ain't dead but they thinkchip and the little doctor are going to catch the night train
you go haze in the team happy
and give 'em a feed of oats chip said  irish and big medicine seeing the three standing soberly together there and sensing something unusual came up and heard the news in stunned silence
andy forgetting his pique at their first disbelief came forlornly back and stood with them
the old manthe thing could not be true
to every man of them his presence conjured by the impending tragedy was almost a palpable thing
his stocky figure seemed almost to stand in their midst he looked at them with his whimsical eyes which had the radiating crowsfeet of age humor and habitual squinting against sun and wind the bald spot on his head the wrinkling shirtcollar that seldom knew a tie the carpet slippers which were his favorite footgear because they were kind to his bunions his husky voice goodnaturedly complaining were poignantly real to them at that moment
then irish mentally pictured him lying maimed dying perhaps in a faroff hospital among strangers and swore
if he's got to die it oughta be here where folks know him andwhere he knows irish was not accustomed to giving voice to his deeper feelings and he blundered awkwardly over it
i never did go much on them darned hospitals anyway weary observed gloomily
he oughta be home where folks can look after him
mamma
it sure is a fright  i betche chip and the little doctor won't get there in time happy jack predicted with his usual pessimism
the old man's gittin' old  he ain't but fiftytwo yuh call that old consarn yuh
he's younger right now than you'll be when you're forty  countess is going along too so she can ride herd on the kid pink informed then
i heard the little doctor tell her to pack up and 'never mind if she did have sponge all set'
countess seemed to think her bread was a darned sight more important than the old man
that's the way with women
they'll pass up  well by golly i like to see a woman take some interest in her own affairs slim defended
what they packin' up for and where they goin' slim had just ridden up to the group in time to overhear pink's criticism
they told him the news and slim swallowed twice said by golly quite huskily and then rode slowly away with his head bowed
he had worked for the flying u when it was strictly a bachelor outfit and with the tenacity of slow minds he held j g whitmore his beloved old man  as but a degree lower than that mysterious power which made the sun to shineand if the truth were known he had accepted him as being quite as eternal
his loyalty adjusted everything to the interests of the flying u
that the old man could diethe possibility stunned him
they were a sorry company that gathered that night around the long table with its mottled oilcloth covering and benches polished to a glasslike smoothness with their own vigorous bodies
they did not talk much about the old man indeed they came no nearer the subject than to ask weary if he were going to drive the team in to dry lake
they did not talk much about anything for that matter even the knives and forks seemed to share the general depression of spirits and failed to give forth the cheerful clatter which was a daily accompaniment of meals in that room
old patsy he who had cooked for j g whitmore when the flying u coulee was a wilderness and the brand yet unrecorded and the irons unmadepatsy lumbered heavily about the room and could not find his dishcloth when it was squeezed tight in one great fat hand and unthinkingly started to fill their coffee cups from the teakettle
py cosh i vould keel der fool vot made her first von of der automobeels yet he exclaimed unexpectedly after a long silence and cast his pipe vindictively toward his bunk in one corner
the happy family looked around at him then understandingly at one another
same here patsy jack bates agreed
what they want of the damned things when the country's full uh good horses gits me  so some yahoo with just sense enough to put goggles on to cover up his fool face can run over folks he ain't good enough to speak to by cripes big medicine glared aggressively up and down the table
weary got up suddenly and went out and slim followed him though his supper was halfuneaten
this goin' to be hard on the little doctoronly brother she's got  they heard happy jack point out unnecessarily and weary the equable was guilty of slamming the door so that the whole building shook by way of demonstrating his dislike of speech upon the subject
they were a sorry company who waved hands at the little doctor and the kid and the countess just when the afterglow of a red sunset was merging into the vague purple shadows of coming dusk
they stood silent for the most part and let them go without the usual facetious advice to be good to yourselves and the hackneyed admonition to chip to keep out of jail if he could
there must have been something very wistful in their faces for the little doctor smiled bravely down upon then from the buggy seat and lifted up the kid for a fourtoothed smile and an ecstatic bye accompanied by a vigorous flopping of hands which included then all
we'll telegraph first thing boys the little doctor called back as the rig chucked into the pebbly creek crossing
we'll keep you posted and i'll write all the particulars as soon as i can
don't think the worstunless you have to
i don't she smiled again and waved her hand hastily because of the kid's contortions and though the smile had tears close behind it though her voice was tremulous in spite of herself the happy family took heart from her courage and waved their hats gravely and smiled back as best they could
there's a lot uh cake you boys might just as well eat up the countess called belatedly
it'll all dry out if yuh don'tand there ain't no use wastin' itand there's two lemon pies in the brown cupboard and what under the shinin' sun the wheels bumped violently against a rock and the happy family heard no more
chapter iv
some hopes  on the third day after the happy family decided that there should be some word from chicago and since that day was sunday they rode in a body to dry lake after it
they had not discussed the impending tragedy very much but they were an exceedingly unhappy family nevertheless and since flying u coulee was but a place of gloom they were not averse to leaving it behind them for a few hours and riding where every stick and stone did not remind then of the old man
in dry lake was a message brief but heartening  j
g still alive
some hopes
they left the station with lighter spirits after reading that rode to the hotel tied their horses to the long hitching pole there and went in
and right there the happy family unwittingly became cast for the leading parts in one of those dramas of the west which never is heard of outside the theater in which grim circumstance stages it for a single playingunless indeed the curtain rings down on a tragedy that brings the actors before their district judge for trial
and as so frequently is the case the beginning was casual to the point of triviality
sary ellen marg'reet sybilly and jos'phine denson spelled in accordance with parental pronunciation were swinging idly upon the hitching pole with the selfconscious sang froid of country children come to town
they backed away from the happy family's approach grinned foolishly in response to their careless greeting and tittered openly at the resplendence of the native son who was wearing his black angora chaps with the three white diamonds down each leg the gay horsehair hatband crimson neckerchief and mexican spurs with their immense rowels and ornate conchos of handbeaten silver
sary ellen marg'reet jos'phine and sybilly were also resplendent in their way
their carroty hair was tied with ribbons quite aggressively new their freckles shone with maternal scrubbing and there was a hint of homemade crochetlace beneath each stiffly starched dress
hello kids weary greeted them amiably with a secret smile over the memory of a time when they had purloined the little doctor's pills and had made reluctant acquaintance with a stomach pump
where's the circus going to be at  there ain't goin' to be no circus sybilly retorted because she was the forward one of the family
we're going away on the train
the next one that comes along
we're going to be on it all night too and we'll have to eat on it too  well by golly you'll want something to eat then slim was feeling abstractedly in his pocket for a coin for these were the nieces of the countess and therefore claimed more than a cursory interest from slim
you take this up to the store and see if yuh can't swop it for something good to eat because sary was the smallest of the lot he pressed the dollar into her shrinking amazed palm
paw's got more money'n that sybilly announced proudly
paw's got a million dollars
a man bought our ranch and gave him a lot of money
we're rich now
maybe paw'll buy us a phonygraft
he said maybe he would
and maw's goin' to have a blue silk dress with green onto it
and  better haze along and buy that grub stake slim interrupted the family gift for profuse speech
he had caught the boys grinning and fancied that they were tracing a likeness between the garrulity of sybilly and the fluency of her aunt the countess
you don't want that train to go off and leave yuh by golly  wonder who bought denson out cal emmett asked of no one in particular as the children went strutting off to the store to spend the dollar which little sary clutched so tightly it seemed as if the goddess of liberty must surely have been imprinted upon her palm
when they went inside and found denson himself pompously setting 'em up to the house cal repeated the question in a slightly different form to the man himself
denson while he was ready to impress the beholders with his unaccustomed affluence became noticeably embarrassed at the inquiry and edged off into vague generalities
i jest nacherlly had to sell when i got m' price he told the happy family in a tone that savored strongly of apology
i like the country and i like m' neighbors fine
never'd ask for better than the flyin' u has been t' me
i ain't got no kick comin' there
sorry to hear the old man's hurt back east
mary was real put out at not bein' able to see louise 'fore she went awaylouise being the countess' and mary denson's sisterbut soon as i sold i got oneasy like
the feller wanted p'session right away too so i told mary we might as well start b'fore we git outa the notion
i wouldn't uh cared about sellin' maybe but the kids needs to be in school
they're growin' up in ign'rance out here and mary's folks wants us to come back 'n' settle close handy bythey been at us t' sell out and move fer the last five years now and i told mary  even cal forgot eventually that he had asked a question which remained unanswered what interest he had felt at first was smothered to death beneath that blanket of words and he eagerly followed the boys out and over to rusty brown's place where denson because of an old grudge against rusty might be trusted not to follow
mamma weary commented amusedly when they were crossing the street that denson bunch can sure talk the fastest and longest and say the least of any outfit i ever saw  wonder who did buy him out jack bates queried
old gingerwhiskers didn't pass out any facts yuh notice
he couldn't have got much his land's mostly gravel and 'doby patches
he's got a water right on flying u creek you knowfirst right at that seems to meand a dandy fine spring in that coulee
wonder why our outfit didn't buy him outseeing he wanted to sell so bad  this wantin' to sell is something i never heard of b'fore slim said slowly
to hear him tell it that ranch uh hisn was worth a dollar an inch by golly
i don't b'lieve he's been wantin' to sell out
if he had mis' bixby woulda said something about it
she don't know about this here sellin' business or she'd a said  yeah you can most generally bank on the countess telling all she knows cal assented with some sarcasm at which slim grunted and turned sulky afterward
denson and his affairs they speedily forgot for a time in the diversion which rusty brown's familiar place afforded to young men with unjaded nerves and a zest for the primitive pleasures
not until midafternoon did it occur to them that flying u coulee was deserted by all save old patsy and that there were chores to be done if all the creatures of the coulee would sleep in comfort that night
pink therefore withdrew his challenge to the bunch and laid his billiard cue down with a sigh and the remark that all he lacked was time to have the scalps of every last one of them hanging from his belt
pink was figurative in his speech you will understand and also a bit vainglorious over beating andy green and big medicine twice in succession
it occurred to weary then that a word of cheer to the old man and his anxious watchers might not cone amiss
therefore the happy family mounted and rode to the depot to send it and on the way wrangled over the wording of the message after their usual contentious manner
better tell 'em everything is fine at this end uh the line cal suggested and was hooted at for a poet
just say weary began when he was interrupted by the discordant clamor from a trainload of sheep that had just pulled in and stopped
'maaaa maaaaa' darn yuh he shouted derisively at the peering plaintive faces glimpsed between the closeset bars
mamma how i do love sheep whereupon he put spurs to his horse and galloped down to the station to rid his ears of the turbulent wave of protest from the cars
naturally it required some time to compose the telegram in a style satisfactory to all parties
outside cars banged together an engine snorted stertorously and suffocating puffs of coal smoke now and then invaded the waitingroom while the happy family were sending that message of cheer to chicago
if you are curious the final version of their combined sentiments was not at all spectacular
it said merely  everything fine here
take good care of the old man
how's the kid stacking up  it was signed simply the bunch  mary's little lambs are here yet i see the native son remarked carelessly when they went out
enough lambs for all the marys in the country
how would you like to be mary  not for me irish declared and turned his face away from the stench of them
others there were who rode the length of the train with faces averted and looks of disdain cowmen all of them they shared the range prejudice and took no pains to hide it
the wind blew strong from the east that day it whistled through the open doubledecked cars packed with gray woolly bodies whose voices were ever raised in strident complaint and the stench of them smote the unaccustomed nostrils of the happy family and put them to disgusted flight up the track and across it to where the air was clean again
honest to grandma i'd make the poorest kind of a sheepherder big medicine bawled earnestly when they were well away from the noise and smell of the detested animals
if i had to herd sheep by cripes do you know what i'd do
i'd haze 'em into a coulee and turn loose with a good rifle and plenty uh shells and call in the coyotes to git a square meal
that's the way i'd herd sheep
it's the only way you can shut 'em up
they just 'baaaa baaaa baaaa' from the time they're dropped till somebody kills 'em off
honest they blat in their sleep
i've heard 'em  when you and the dogs were shooting off coyotes asked andy green pointedly and so precipitated dissension which lasted for ten miles
chapter v sheep  slim rising first from dinner on the next day but one opened the door of the messhouse and stood there idly picking his teeth before he went about his work
after a minute of listening to the boys joshing old patsy about some gooseberry pies he had baked without sugar he turned his face outward threw up his head like a startled bull and began to sniff
say i smell sheep by golly he announced in the bellowing tone which was his conversational voice and sniffed again
oh that's just a leftover in your system from the dose yuh got in town sunday weary explained soothingly
i've smelled sheep and tasted sheep and dreamed sheep ever since  no by golly it's sheep
it ain't no memory
ii b'hieve i hear 'em too by golly slim stepped out away from the building and faced suspiciously down the coulee
slim i never suspected you of imagination before the native son drawled and loitered out to where slim stood still sniffing
i wonder if you're catching it from andy and me
don't you think you ought to be vaccinated  that ain't imagination pink called out from within
when anybody claims there's sheep in flying u coulee that's straight loco  come on out here and smell 'em yourself then slim bawled indignantly
i never seen such an outfit as this is gittin' to be you fellers don't believe nobody no more
we ain't all andy greens  upon hearing this andy pushed back his chair and strolled outside
he clapped his hand down upon slim's fatcushioned shoulder and swayed him gently
never mind slim you can't all be famous he comforted
some day maybe i'll teach yuh the fine art of lying more convincingly than the ordinary man can tell the truth
it is a fine art it takes a genius to put it across
now the only time anybody doubts my word is when i'm sticking to the truth hike a sand burr to a dog's tail  from away to the west borne on the wind which swept steadily down the coulee came that faint humming singsong which can be made only by a herd of a thousand or more sheep all blatting in different keysor by a distant band playing monotonously upon the middle octave of their varied instruments
slim's right by gracious
it's sheep sure as yuh live andy did not wait for more but started at a fast walk for the stable and his horse
after him went the native son who had not been with the flying u long enough to sense the magnitude of the affront and slim who knew to a nicety just what cowmen considered the unpardonable sin and the rest of the happy family who were rather incredulous still
must be some fool herder just crossing the coulee on the move somewhere weary gave as a solution
half of 'em don't know a fence when they see it  as they galloped toward the sound and the smell they expressed freely their opinion of sheep the men who owned them and the lunatics who watched over the blatting things
they were cattlemen to the marrow in their bones and they gloried in their prejudice against the woolly despoilers of the range
all these years had the flying u been immune from the nuisance save for an occasional trespasser who was quickly sent about his business
the flying u range had been kept in the main inviolate from the little gray vandals which ate the grass clean to the sod and trampled with their sharppointed hoofs the very roots into lifelessness which polluted the waterholes and creeks until cattle and horses went thirsty rather than drink which in that land of scant rainfall devastated the range where they fed so that a longestablished prairiedog town was not more barren
what wonder if the men who owned cattle and those who tended them hated sheep
so does the farmer dread an invasion of grasshoppers
a mile down the coulee they came upon the band with two herders and four dogs keeping watch
across the coulee and up the hillsides they spread like a noisome gray blanket
maaaa maaaa maaaa two thousand strong they blatted a strident medley while they hurried here and there after sweeter bunches of grass very much like a disturbed anthill
the herders loitered upon either slope their dogs lying close beside them
there was good grass in that part of the coulee the flying u had saved it for the saddle horses that were to be gathered and held temporarily at the ranch for it would save herding and a week in that pasture would put a keen edge on their spirits for the hard work of the calf roundup
a dozen or two that ranged close had already been driven into the field and were feeding disdainfully in a corner as far away from the sheep as the fence would permit
the happy family riding closegrouped stiffened in their saddles and stared amazed at the outrage
sheepherders never did have any nerve irish observed after a minute
they keep their places fine
they'll drive their sheep right into your dooryard and tell 'en to help themselves to anything that happens to look good to them
oh they're sure modest and retiring  weary who had charge of the outfit during chip's absence was making straight for the nearest herder
pink and andy went with him as a matter of course
you fellows ride up around that side and put the run on them sheep  weary shouted back to the others
we'll start the other side moving
make 'em travelback where they came from he jerked his head toward the north
he knew just as they all knew that there had been no sheep to the south unless one counted those that ranged across the missouri river
as the three forced their horses up the steep slope the herder sitting slouched upon a rock glanced up at them dully
he had a long stick with which he was apathetically turning over the smaller stones within his reach and as apathetically killing the black bugs that scuttled out from the moist earth beneath
he desisted from this unexciting pastime as they drew near and eyed them with the sullenness that comes of long isolation when the person's nature forbids that other extreme of babbling garrulity for no man can live long months alone and remain perfectly normal
nature that stern mistress always exacts a penalty from us foolish mortals who would ignore the instincts she has wisely implanted within us for our good
maybe weary began mildly and without preface you don't know this is private property
get busy with your dogs and haze these sheep back on the bench he waved his hand to the north
and when you get a good start in that direction he added yuh better keep right on going  the herder surveyed him morosely but he said nothing neither did he rise from the rock to obey the command
the dogs sat upon their haunches and perked their ears inquiringly as if they understood better than did their master that these men were not to be quite overlooked
i meant today weary hinted with the manner of one who deliberately holds his voice quiet
i never asked yuh what yuh meant the herder mumbled scowling
we got to keep 'em on water another hour yet he went back to turning over the small rocks and to pursuing with his stick the bugs as if the whole subject were squeezed dry of interest
for a minute weary stared unwinkingly down at him uncertain whether to resent this as pure insolence or to condone it as imbecility
mamma  he breathed eloquently and grinned at andy and pink
this is a real talkative cuss and obliging too
come on boys he's too busy to bother with a little thing like sheep  he led the way around to the far side of the band the nearest sheep scuttling away from then as they passed
i don't suppose we could work the combination on those dogswhat he considered aloud glancing back at them where they still sat upon their haunches and watched the strange riders
say cadwalloper you took a few lessons in sheepherding a couple of years ago when you was stuck on that girlremember
whistle 'em up here and set 'en to work  you go to the devil pink's curved hips replied amiably to his boss
i've got lossuhmemory on the sheep business  whereat weary grinned and said no more about it
on the opposite side of the coulee the boys seemed to be laboring quite as fruitlessly with the other herder
they heard big medicine's truculent bellow as he leaned from the saddle and waved a fist close to the face of the herder but though they rode with their eyes fixed upon the group they failed to see any resultant movement of dogs sheep or man
there is at times a certain safety in being the hopeless minority
though seven indignant cowpunchers surrounded him that herder was secure from any personal molestationand he knew it
they were seven against one therefore after making some caustic remarks which produced as little effect as had weary's command upon the first man the seven were constrained to ride here and there along the wavering gray line and with shouts and swinging ropes themselves drive the sheep from the coulee
there was much clamor and dust and riding to and fro
there was language which would have made the mothers of then weep and there were faces grown crimson from wrath
eventually however the happy family faced the north fence of the flying u boundary and saw the last woolly back scrape under the lower wire leaving a toll of greasy wool hanging from the barbs
the herders had drawn together and were looking on from a distance and the four dogs were yelping uneasily over their enforced inaction
the happy family went back and rounded up the herders and by sheer weight of numbers forced them to the fence without laying so much as a finger upon then
the one who had been killing black bugs gave then an ugly look as he crawled through but even he did not say anything
snap them wires down where they belong weary commanded tersely
the man hesitated a minute then sullenly unhooked the barbs of the two lower strands so that the wires which had thus been lifted to permit the passing of the sheep twanged apart and once more stretched straight from post to post
now just keep in mind the fact that fences are built for use
this is a private ranch and sheep are just about as welcome as smallpox
haze them stinking things as far north as they'll travel before dark and at daylight start 'em going again
where's your camp anyhow  none of your business mumbled the bugkiller sourly
weary scanned the undulating slope beyond the fence saw no sign of a camp and glanced uncertainly at his fellows
well it don't matter much where it is you see to it you don't sleep within five miles of here or you're liable to have bad dreams
hit the trail now  they waited inside the fence until the retreating sheep lost their individuality as blatting animals ambling erratically here and there while they moved toward the brow of the hill and merged into a great gray blotch against the faint green of the new grassa blotch from which rose again that vibrant singsong humming of many voices mingled
then they rode back down the coulee to their own work taking it for granted that the trespassing was an incident which would not be repeatedby those particular sheep at any rate
it was therefore with something of a shock that the happy family awoke the next morning to hear pink's melodious treble shouting in the bunkhouse at sunrise next morning  'g'waay round' 'em shep
seven black ones in the coulee men who know well the west are familiar with that facetious call
ah what's the matter with yuh irish raised a rumpled brown head from his pillow and blinked sleepily at him
i've been dreaming i was a sheepherder all night  well you've got the swellest chance in the world to 'make every dream cone true dearie' pink retorted
the whole blamed coulee's full uh sheep
i woke up a while ago and thought i just imagined i heard 'en again so i went out to take a lookor a smell it wasand they're sure enough there  weary swung one long leg out from under his blankets and reached for his clothes
he did not say anything but his face portended trouble for the invaders
say cried big medicine coming out of his bunk as if it were afire i tell yuh right now then blattin' human apes wouldn't git gay around here if i was runnin' this outfit
the way i'd have of puttin' them sheep on the run wouldn't be slow by cripes
i'll guarantee  by then the bunkhouse was buzzing with voices and there was none to give heed to big medicine s blatant boasting
others there were who seemed rather inclined to give weary good advice while they pulled on their boots and sought for their gloves and rolled earlymorning cigarettes and otherwise prepared themselves for what fate might have waiting for then outside the door
are you sure they're in the coulee cadwalloper weary asked during a brief lull
they could be up on the hill  hell yes was pink's forceful answer
they could be on the hill but they ain't
why darn it they're straggling into the little pasture
i could see 'em from the stable
they  come and eat your breakfast first boys anyway weary had his hand upon the doorknob
a few minutes more won't make any difference one way or the other he went out and over to the messhouse to see if patsy had the coffee ready for this was a good threequarters of an hour earlier than the flying u outfit usually bestirred themselves on these days of preparation for roundup and waiting for good grass
i'll be darned if i'd be as calm as he is cal emmett muttered while the door was being closed
good thing the old man ain't here now
he'd go straight up in the air
he wouldn't wait for no breakfast  i betche there'll be a killin' yet before we're through with them sheep gloomed happy jack
when sheepherders starts in once to be ornery there ain't no way uh stoppin' 'em except by killin' 'em off
and that'll mean the pen for a lot of us fellers  well by golly it won't be me slim declared loudly
yuh wouldn't ketch me goin' t' jail for no doggone sheepherder
they oughta be a bounty on 'en by rights  seems queer they'd be right back here this morning after being hazed out yesterday afternoon said andy green thoughtfully
looks like they're plumb anxious to build a lot of trouble for themselves  patsy thumping energetically the bottom of a tin pan sent them trooping to the messhouse
there it was evident that the breakfast had been unduly hurried there were no biscuits in sight for one thing though patsy was lumbering about the stove frying hotcakes
they were in too great a hurry to wait for them however
they swallowed their coffee hurriedly bolted a few mouthfuls of meat and fried eggs and let it go at that
weary looked at then with a faint smile
i'm going to give a few of you fellows a chance to herd sheep today he announced cooling his coffee so that it would not actually scald his palate
that's why i wanted you to get some grub into you
some of you fellows will have to take the trail up on the hill and meet us outside the fence so when we chase 'em through you can make a good job of it this time
i wonder  you don't need to call out the troops for that job one man is enough to put the fear uh the lord into then herders andy remarked slightingly
once they're on the move  all right my boy we'll let you be the man weary told him promptly
i was going to have a bunch of you take a packadero outfit down toward boiler bottom and comb the breaks along there for horsesand i sure do hate to spend the whole day chasing sheepherders around over the country
so we'll haze 'em through the fence again and seeing you feel that way about it i'll let you go around and keep 'em going
and if you locate their camp kinda impress it on the tender if you can round him up that the flying u ain't pasturing sheep this spring
no matter what kinda talk he puts up you put the run on 'em till you see 'em across oneman coulee
better have patsy put you up a lunchunless you're fond of mutton  andy twisted his mouth disgustedly
say i'm going to quit handing out any valuable advice to you weary he expostulated
hawhawhawww laughed big medicine and slapped andy on the shoulder so that his face almost came in contact with his plate
yuh will try to work some innercent man into sheepherdin' will yuh
hawhawhaww
you'll come in tonight blattin'if yuh don't stay out on the range tryin' t' eat grass by cripes
andy had a little lamb that follered him around  better let bud take that herdin' job weary andy suggested
it won't hurt himhe's blattin' already  if you think you're liable to need somebody along weary began softheartedly relenting why i guess  if i can't handle two crazy sheepherders without any help by gracious i'll get me a job holdin' yarn in an old ladies' hone andy cut in hastily and got up from the table
being a truthful man i can't say i'm stuck on the job but i'm game for it
and i'll promise you there won't be no more sheep of that brand lickin' our doorsteps
what darned outfit is it anyway
i never bumped into any dot sheep before to my knowledge  it's a new one on me weary testified heading the procession down to the stable
if they belonged anywhere in this part of the country though they wouldn't be acting the way they are
they'd be wise to the fact that it ain't healthy  even while he spoke his eyes were fixed with cold intensity upon a fringe of gray across the coulee below the little pasture
to the nostrils of the outraged happy family was borne that indescribable aroma which betrays the presence of sheep that aroma which sheepmen love and which cattlemen hate and which a favorable wind will carry a long way
they slapped saddles on their horses in record time that morning and raced down the coulee ironically shouting commiserating sentences to the unfortunate andy who rode slowly up to the messhouse for the lunch which patsy had waiting for him in a flour sack and afterward climbed the grade and loped along outside the line fence to a point opposite the sheep and the shouting horsemen who forced them back by weight of numbers
this morning the herders were not quite so passive
the bugkiller still scowled but he spoke without the preliminary sulky silence of the day before  we're goin' across the coulee he growled
them's orders
we range south uh here  no you don't weary dissented calmly
not by a long shot you don't
you're going back where you come fromif you ask me
and you're going quick    chapter vi
what happened to andy  with the sun shining comfortably upon his back and with a cigarette between his lips andy sat upon his horse and watched in silent glee while the irate happy family scurried here and there behind the band swinging their ropes down upon the woolly backs and searching their vocabularies for new and terrible epithets
andy smiled broadly as a colorful phrase now and then boomed across the coulee in that clear snappy atmosphere which carries sounds so far
he did not expect to do much smiling upon his own account that day and he was therefore grateful for the opportunity to behold the spectacle before him
there was slim for instance unwillingly careening down hill toward home because in his zeal to slap an old ewe smartly with his rope he drove her unexpectedly under his horse and so created a momentary panic that came near standing both horse and rider upon their heads
and there was big medicine whistling until he was purple while the herder with a single gesture held the dog motionless though a dozen sheep broke back from the band and climbed a slope so steep that big medicine was compelled to go after them afoot and turn them with stones and profane objurgations
it was very funnywhen one could sit at ease upon the hilltop and smoke a cigarette while others risked apoplexy and their souls' salvation below
by the time they panted up the last rockstrewn slope of the bluff and sent the vanguard of the invaders under the fence andy's mood was complacent in the extreme and his smile offensively wide
oh you needn't look so sorry for us drawled the native son jingling over toward him until only the fence and a few feet of space divided them
here's where you get yours amigo
i wish you a pleasant dayand a long one he waved his hand in mocking adieu touched his horse with his silver spurs and rode gaily away down the coulee
here sheepherder's your outfit
maaaaa jeered big medicine
you'll wisht by cripes you was a dozen men just like yuh before you're through with the deal
hawhawhaww  there were others who seeing andy's grin had something to say upon the subject before they left
weary rode up and looked undecidedly from andy to the sheep and back again
if you don't feel like tackling it singlehanded i'll send  what do yuh think i am anyway andy interrupted crisply a montgomery ward twoforaquarter cowpuncher
don't you fellows waste any time worrying over me  the herders stared at andy curiously when he swung in behind the tailend of the band and kept pace with their slow moving but they did not speak beyond shouting an occasional command to their dogs
neither did andy have anything to say until he saw that they were swinging steadily to the west instead of keeping straight north as they had been told to do
then he rode over to the nearest herder who happened to be the bugkiller
you don't want to get turned around he hinted quietly
that's north over there  i'm workin' fer the man that pays my wages the fellow retorted glumly and waved an arm to a collie that was waiting for orders
the dog dropped his head and ran around the right wing of the band with sharp yelps and dartings here and there turning them still more to the west
andy hesitated decided to leave the man alone for the present and rode around to the other herder
you swing these sheep north he commanded disdaining preface or explanation
i'm workin' for the man that pays my wages the herder made answer stolidly and chewed steadily upon a quid of tobacco that had stained his lips unbecomingly
so they had talked the thing overhad those two herdersand were following a premeditated plan of defiance
andy hooked at the man a minute
you turn them sheep damn you he commanded again and laid a hand upon his saddlehorn suggestively
you go to the devil damn yuh advised the herder and cocked a wary eye at him from under his hatbrim
not all herders let it be said in passing take unto themselves the mental attributes of their sheep there are those who believe that a bold front is better than weak compliance and who will back that belief by a very bold front indeed
andy appraised him mentally decided that he was an ablebodied man and therefore fightable and threw his right leg over the cantle with a quite surprising alacrity
are you going to turn them sheep andy was taking off his coat when he made that inquiry
not for your tellin'
you keep back young feller or i'll sick the dogs on yuh he turned and whistled to the nearest one and andy hit him on the ear
they clinched and pummeled when they could and where they could
the dog came up circled the gyrating forms twice then sat down upon his haunches at a safe distance tilted his head sidewise and lifted his ears interestedly
he was a wise little dog the other dog was also wise and remained phlegmatically at his post as did the bugkiller
are you going to turn them sheep andy spoke breathlessly but with deadly significance
nyes  andy took his fingers from the other's adam's apple his knee from the other's diaphragm and went over to where he had thrown down his coat felt in a pocket for his handkerchief and when he had found it applied it to his nose which was bleeding profusely
fly at it then he advised eyeing the other sternly over the handkerchief
i'd hate to ask you a third time  i'd hate to have yuh conceded the herder reluctantly
i was sure i c'd lick yuh or i'd 'a' turned 'em before he sent the dog racing down the south line of the band
andy got thoughtfully back upon his horse and sat looking hard at the herder
say you're grade above the general run uh lambhickers he observed after a minute
who are you working for and what's your object in throwing sheep on flying u land
there's plenty of range to the north  i'm workin' said the herder for the dot outfit
i thought you could read brands  don't get sassyi've got a punch or two i haven't used yet
who owns these woollies  wellwhittaker and oleson if yuh want to know  i do andy was keeping pace with him around the band which edged off from then and the dogs
and what makes you so crazy about flying u grass he pursued
we've got to cross that coulee to git to where we're headed for we got a right to and we're going to do it the herder paused and glanced up at andy sourly
we knowed you was a mean outfit the boss told us so
and he told us you was blank ca'tridges and we needn't back up just 'cause you raised up on your hind legs and howled a little
i've had truck with you cowmen before
i've herded sheep in wyoming he walked a few steps with his head down considering
i better go over and talk some sense into the other fellow he said looking up at andy as if all his antagonism had oozed in the fight
you ride along this edge so they won't scatterwe ought to be grazin' 'em along by rights only you seem to be in such an allfired rush  you go on and tell that loco sonofagun over there what he's up against andy urged
blank cartridgesi sure do like that
if you only knew it high power dumdums would be a lot closer to our brand
run alongi am in a kinda hurry this morning  andy riding slowly upon the outskirts of the grazing blatting band watched the two confer earnestly together a hundred yards or so away
they seemed to be having some sort of argument the bugkiller gesticulated with the long stick he carried and the sheep while the herders talked scattered irresponsibly
andy wondered what made sheepmen so ornery particularly herders
he wondered why the fellow he had thrashed was so insultingly defiant at first and after the thrashing so unresentful and communicative and so amenable to authority withal
he felt his nose and decided that it was all things considered a cheap victory and yet one of which he need not be ashamed
the herder cane back presently and helped drive the sheep over the edge of the bluff which bordered antelope coulee
the bugkiller upon his side also seemed imbued with the spirit of obedience andy heard him curse a collie into frenzied zeal and smiled approvingly
now you're acting a heap more human he observed and the man from wyoming grinned ruefully by way of reply
antelope coulee at that point was steep too steep for riding so that andy dismounted and dug his bootheels into the soft soil to gain a foothold on the descent
when he was halfway down he chanced to look back straight into the scowling gaze of the bugkiller who was sliding down behind him
thought you were hazing down the other side of 'em andy called back but the herder did not choose to answer save with another scowl
andy edged his horse around an impracticable slope of shale stuff and went on
the herder followed
when he was within twelve feet or so of the bottom there was a sound of pebbles knocked loose in haste a scrambling and then came the impact of his body
andy teetered lost his balance and went to the bottom in one glorious slide
he landed with the bugkiller on topand the bugkiller failed to remove his person as speedily as true courtesy exacted
andy kicked and wriggled and tried to remember what was that highcolored vituperative sentence that irish had invented over a stubborn sheep that he might repeat it to the bugkiller
the herder from wyoming ran up caught andy's horse and untied andy's rope from the saddle
good fer you oscar he praised the bugkiller
hang onto him while i take a few turns he thereupon helped force andy's arms to his side and wound the rope several times rather tightly around andy's outraged squirming person
oh it ain't goin' to do yuh no good to buck 'n bawl admonished the tier
i learnt this here little trick down in wyoming
a bunch uh punchers done it to meand i've been just achin' all over fer a chance to return the favor to some uh you gay boys
and he added with malicious satisfaction while he rolled andy over and tied a perfectly unslippable knot behind it gives me great pleasure to hand the dose out to you in p'ticular
if i was a mean man i'd hand yuh the boot a few times fer luck but i'll save that up till next time  you can bet your sweet life there'll be a next time andy promised earnestly with embellishments better suited to the occasion than to a children's party
well when it arrives i'm sure johnnyonthespot
them wyoming punchers beat me up after they'd got me tied
i'm tellin' yuh so you'll see i ain't mean unless i'm drove to it
turn him feet down hill oscar so he won't git a rush uh brains to the head and die on our hands
now you're goin' to mind your own business sonny
next time yuh set out to herd sheep better see the boss first and git on the job right  he rose to his feet surveyed andy with his hands on his hips mentally pronounced the job well done and took a generous chew of tobacco after which he grinned down at the trussed one
that the language uh flowers you're talkin' he inquired banteringly before he turned his attention to the horse which he disposed of by tying up the reins and giving it a slap on the rump
when it had trotted fifty yards down the coulee bottom and showed a disposition to go farther he whistled to his dogs and turned again to andy
this here is just a hint to that bunch you trot with to leave us and our sheep alone he said
we don't pick no quarrels but we're goin' to cross our sheep wherever we dern please to git where we want to go
gawd didn't make this range and hand it over to you cowmen to put in yer pocketsi guess there's a chance fer other folks to hang on by their eyebrows anyway  andy lying there like a very good presentation of a giant cocoon roped round and round with his arms pinned to his sides had the doubtful pleasure of seeing that noisome foolishfaced band trail down antelope coulee and back upon the level they had just left and of knowing to a gloomy certainty that he could do nothing about it except swear and even that palls when a man has gone over his entire repertoire three times in rapid succession
andy therefore when the last sheep had trotted out of sight hearing and smell wriggled himself into as comfortable a position as his bonds would permit and took a nap
chapter vii
truth crushed to earth etc
andy only half awake tried to obey both instinct and habit and reach up to pull his hat down over his eyes so that the sun could not shine upon his lids so hotly when he discovered that he could do no more than wiggle his fingers he came back with a jolt to reality and tried to sit up
it is surprising to a man to discover suddenly just how important a part his arms play in the most simple of body movements andy with his arms pinioned tightly the whole length of them rolled over on his face kicked a good deal and rolled back again but he did not sit up as he had confidently expected to do
he lay absolutely quiet for at least five minutes staring up at the brilliant blue arch above him
then he began to speak rapidly and earnestly a man just close enough to hear his voice sweeping up to a certain rhetorical climax pausing there and commencing again with a rhythmic fluency of intonation might have thought that he was repeating poetry indeed it sounded like some of milton's majestic blank verse but it was not
andy was engaged in a methodical scientific reprehensibly soulsatisfying period of swearing
a curlew soaring low with long beak outstretched before him and long legs outstretched behind cast a beady eye upon him and shrilled correck
correck in unregenerate approbation of the blasphemy
andy stopped suddenly and laughed
glad you agree with me old sport  he addressed the bird whimsically with a reaction to his normally cheerful outlook
sheepherders are all those things i named over birdie and some that i can't think of at present  he tried again this time with a more careful realization of his limitations to assume an upright position and being a persevering young man and one with a ready wit he managed at length to wriggle himself back upon the slope from which he had slid in his sleep and by digging in his heels and going carefully he did at last rise upon his knees and from there triumphantly to his feet
he had at first believed that one of the herders would in the course of an hour or so return and untie him when he hoped to be able to retrieve in a measure his selfrespect which he had lost when the first three feet of his own rope had encircled him
to be tied and trussed by sheepherders
andy gritted his teeth and started down the coulee
he was hungry and his lunch was tied to his saddle
he looked eagerly down the coulee in the faint hope of seeing his horse grazing somewhere along its length until the numbness of his arms and hands reminded him that forty lunches tied upon forty saddles at his side would be of no use to him in his present position
his hands he could not move from his thighs he could wiggle his fingerswhich he did to relieve as much as possible that unpleasant prickly sensation which we call a going to sleep of the afflicted members
when it occurred to him that he could not do anything with his horse if he found it he gave up looking for it and started for the ranch walking awkwardly because of his bonds the sun shining hotly upon his brown head because his hat had been knocked off in the scuffle and he could not pick it up and put it back where it belonged
taking a straight course across the prairie he struck flying u coulee at the point where the sheep had left it
on the way there he had crossed their trail where they went through the fence farther along the coulee than before and therefore with a better chance of passing undetected especially since the happy family believing that he was forcing them steadily to the north would not be watching for sheep
the barbed wire barrier bothered him somewhat
he was compelled to lie down and roll under the fence in the most undignified manner and when he was through there was the problem of getting upon his feet again
but he managed it somehow and went on down the coulee perspiring with the heat and a bitter realization of his ignominy
what the happy family would have to say when they saw him even andy green's vivid imagination declined to picture
he knew by the sun that it was full noon when he came in sight of the stable and corrals and his soul sickened at the thought of facing that derisive bunch of punchers with their fiendish grins and their barbed tongues
but he was hungry and his arms had reached the limit of prickly sensations and were numb to his shoulders
he shook his hair back from his beaded forehead cast a wary glance at the silent stables set his jaw and went on up the hill to the messhouse wishing tardily that he had waited until they were off at work again when he might intimidate old patsy into keeping quiet about his predicament
within the messhouse was the clatter of knives and forks plied by hungry men the sound of desultory talk and a savory odor of good things to eat
the door was closed
andy stood before it as a guiltyconscienced child stands before its teacher clicked his teeth together and since he could not open the door lifted his right foot and gave it a kick to strain the hinges
within were exclamations of astonishment silence and then a heavy tread
patsy opened the door gasped and stood still his eyes popping out like a startled rabbit
well what's eating you andy demanded querulously and pushed past him into the room
not all of the happy family were there
cal jack bates irish and happy jack had gone into the bad lands next to the river but there were enough left to make the soul of andy quiver forebodingly and to send the flush of extreme humiliation to his cheeks
the happy family looked at him in stunned surprise then they glanced at one another in swift wordless inquiry grinned wisely and warily and went on with their dinner
at least they pretended to go on with their dinner while andy glared at them with amazed reproach in his misleadingly honest gray eyes
when you've got plenty of time he said at last in a choked tone maybe one of you obliging cusses will untie this damned rope  why sure pink threw a leg over the bench and got up with cheerful alacrity
i'll do it now if you say so i didn't know but what that was some new fad of yours like  fad andy repeated the word like an explosion
well by golly andy needn't think i'm goin' to foller that there style slim stated solemnly
i need m' rope for something else than to tie n' clothes on with  i sure do hate to see a man wear funny things just to make himself conspicuous pink observed while he fumbled at the knot which was intricate
andy jerked away from him that he might face him ragefully
maybe this looks funny to you he cried husky with wrath
but i can't seem to see the joke myself
i admit i let then herders make a monkey of me
they slipped up behind going down into antelope coulee and slid down the bluff onto me and before i could get up they got me tied all right
i licked one of 'en before that and thought i had 'en gentled down  andy stopped short silenced by that unexplainable sense which warns us when our words are received with cold disbelief
mhhmi thought maybe you'd run up against a hostile jackrabbit or something pink purred and went back to his place on the bench
hawhawhawww came big medicine's tardy bellow
that's more reasonable than the sheepherder story by cripes  andy looked at them much as he had stared up at the sky before he began to swearspeechlessly with a trembling of the muscles around his mouth
he was quite white considering how tanned he was and his forehead was shiny with beads of perspiration standing thickly upon it
weary i wish you'd untie this rope
i can't he spoke still in that peculiar husky tone and when the last words were out his teeth went together with a snap
weary glanced inquiringly across at the native son who was regarding andy steadily as one gazes upon a tangled rope looking for the end which will easiest lead to an untangling
miguel's brown eyes turned languidly to meet the look
you'd better untie him he advised in his soft drawl
he may not be in the habit of doing itbut he's telling the truth  untie me miguel begged andy going over to him and let me at this bunch  i'll do it said weary and rose pacifically
i kinda believe you myself andy
but you can't blame the boys none you've fooled 'em till they're dead shy of anything they can't see through
and besides it sure does look like a plant
i'd back you singlehanded against a dozen sheepherders like then two we've been chasing around
if i hadn't felt that way i wouldn't have sent yuh out alone with 'em  well andy needn't think he's goin' to stick me on that there story  slim declared with brutal emphasis
i've swallered too many baits by golly
he's figurin' on gettin' us all out on the warpath runnin' around in circles so's't he can give us the laugh
i'll bet by golly he paid then herders to tie him up like that
he can't fool me  say slim i do believe your brains is commencin' to sprout big medicine thumped him painfully upon the back by way of accenting the compliment
you got the idee all right  andy stood quiet while weary unwound the rope lifted his numbed arms with some difficulty and displayed to the doubters his ropecreased wrists and purple swollen hands
i couldn't fight a caterpiller right now he said thickly
look at them hands
do yuh call that a josh
i've been tied up like a bedroll for five hours you well never mind he merely repeated a part of what he had recited aloud in antelope coulee the only difference being that he applied the vitriolic utterances to the happy family instead of to sheepherders and that with the second recitation he gained much in fluency and dramatic delivery
it is not nice for a man to swear to swear the way andy did at any rate
but the result perhaps atoned in a measure for the wickedness in that the happy family were absolutely convinced of his sincerity and the feelings of andy greatly relieved so that when he had for the third time that day completely exhausted his vocabulary he sat down and began to eat his dinner with a keen appetite
i don't suppose you know where your horse is at by this tine weary observed as casually as possible breaking a somewhat constrained silence
i don'tand i don't give a darn andy snapped back
he ate a few mouthfuls and added less savagely he wasn't in sight as i came along
i didn't follow the trail i struck straight across and came down the coulee
he may be at the gate and he may be down toward rogers'  pink reached for a toothpick eyeing andy sidelong dimpled his cheeks disarmingly and cleared his throat
please don't kill me off when you get that pie swallowed he began pacifically
strange as it may seem i believe you andy
what i want to know is this who owns them dots
and what are they chasing all over the flying u range for
it looks plumb malicious to me
did you find out anything about 'en andy while youerwhile they his eyes twinkled and betrayed him for an arrant pretender
pink was not afraid of anything on earthleast of all andy green
i will kill yuh by inches if i hear any remarks out of yuh that ain't respectful andy promised thawing to his normal tone which was pleasant to the ear
i didn't find out much about 'em
the fellow i licked told me that whittaker and oleson owned the sheep
he didn't say  wellbygolly shin thrust his head forward belligerently
whittaker
well what d'yuh think uh that he glared from one face to the other his gaze at last resting upon weary
say do yuh reckon it'sdunk  weary paid no heed to slim
he leaned forward his face turned to andy with that concentration of attention which means so much more than mere exclamation
you're sure he said whittaker he asked
his tone and his attitude arrested andy's cup midway to his mouth
surewhittaker and oleson
i never heard of the outfitwho's this whittaker person  weary settled back in his place and smiled but his eyes had quite lost their habitually sunny expression
up until four years ago he explained evenly he was the old man's partner
we caught him in some mighty dirty work andwell he sold out to the old man
the old party with the hoofs and tail can't be everywhere at once the way i've got it sized up so he turns some of his business over to other folks
dunk whittaker's his top hand  why by golly he framed up a job on the gordon boys and railroaded 'em to the pen just  oh that's the gazabo andy's eyes shone with enlightenment
i've heard a lot about dunk but i didn't know his last name  say
i'll bet they're the outfit that bought out denson
that's why old denson acted so queer maybe
selling to a sheep outfit would make the old devil feel kinda uneasy talking to us pink's eyes were big and purple with excitement
and that trainload of sheep we saw sunday i'll bet is the same identical outfit  dunk whittaker'd better not try to monkey with me by golly slim's face was lowering
and he'd better not monkey with the flying u either
i'd pump him so full uh holes he'd look like a colander by golly  weary got up and started to the door his face suddenly grown careworn
slim you and miguel better go and hunt up andy's horse he said with a hint of abstraction in his tone as though his mind was busy with more important things
maybe andy'll feel able to help you set those posts budand you'd better go along the upper end of the little pasture with the wire stretchers and tighten her up the top wire is pretty loose i noticed this morning his fingers fumbled with the doorknob
want me to do anything pink asked quizzically just behind him
i thought sure we'd go and remonstrate with then gay  weary interrupted him
the herders can waitand anyway i've kinda got an idea andy wants to hand out his own brand of poison to that bunch
you and i will take a ride over to denson's and see what's going on over there
mamma he added fervently under his breath i sure do wish chip and the old man were here    chapter viii
the dot outfit  before he laid him down to sleep that night weary had repeated to himself many times and fervently that wish for old j g whitmore and the stout staff upon which he was beginning more and more to lean his brotherinlaw chip bennett
as matters stood weary could not even bring himself to let then know anything about his troubleand that the thing was beginning to assume the form and shape and general malevolent attributes of trouble weary was forced to admit to himself
just at present an unthinking unobserving person might pass over this sheep outfit as a mere unsavory incident but weary was neither unobserving nor unthinkingnor for the matter of that were the rest of the happy family
it needed no happy jack with his foreboding nature to point out the unpleasant possibilities that night when the committee of two made their informal report at the supper table
they had ridden to denson coulee which was in reality a meandering branch of flying u coulee itself
to reach it one rode out of flying u coulee and over a wide hill and down again to denson's
but the creekflying u creekfollowed the devious turnings from denson coulee down to the flying u
a long mile of flying u coulee j g whitmore owned outright
another mile he held under no other title save a fence
the creek flowed through it allbut that creek had its source somewhere up near the head of denson coulee
j g whitmore had to his regret been unable to claim the whole earthor at least that portion of itfor his own so when he was constrained to make a choice he settled himself in the wider more fertile coulee which he thereafter called the flying u
while it is good policy to locate as near as possible to the source of those erratic little creeks which water certain garden spots of the northern range land it is also well to choose land that will grow plenty of hay
j g whitmore chose the hay land and trusted that providence would insure the water supply
through all these years flying u creek had never once disappointed him
denson who settled in the tributary coulee had not made any difference in the water supply and his stock had consisted of thirty or forty head of cattle and horses
when denson sold however things might be different
and if he had sold to a sheepman the change might be unpleasant if he had sold to dunk whittakerthe flying u boys faced that possibility just as they would face any other disaster undaunted but grim and unsmiling
it was thus that pink and weary rode slowly down into denson coulee
two miles back they had passed the band of dot sheep feeding leisurely just without the flying u fence which was the southern boundary
the bugkiller and the other were there and they noted that the features of that other bore witness to the truth of andy's story of the fight
he regarded them with one perfectly good eye and one which was considerably swollen and grinned a swollen grin
the two had ridden ten paces past him when pink pulled up suddenly
i'm going to get off and lick that sonofagun myself just for luck he stated dispassionately
i'm going to lick 'em both he revised while he dismounted
oh come on cadwalloper weary dissuaded
you'll likely have all the excitement you need without that  here you hold this fool cayuse
no he shook his head cutting short further protest
you're the boss and you don't want to mix in and that part is all right
but i ain't responsibleand i sure am going to take a fall or two out of these geesers
they're awl together too stuck on themselves to suit me pink did not say that he was thinking of andy but nevertheless a vivid recollection of that unfortunate young man's ropecreased wrists and swollen hands sent him toward the herder with long eager strides
pink was not tall and he was slight and boyish of build also his cherubic face topped by tawny curls and lighted by eyes as deeply blue and as innocent as a baby's probably deceived that herder just as they had deceived many another
for pink was a good deal like a stick of dynamite wrapped in white tissue paper and tied with blue ribbon and weary was not at all uneasy over the outcome as he watched pink go clanking back though he loved him well
pink did not waste any time or words on the preliminaries
with a delightful frankness of purpose he pulled off his coat and threw it on the ground as he came up sent his hat after it and arrived fist first
the herder had waited grinning and he had shouted something to weary about spanking the kid if weary didn't make him behave
speedily he became a very surprised herder and a distressed one as well
all right pink remarked a little quickbreathed when the herder decided for the third time to get up
a friend of mine worked yuh over a little this morning and i just thought i'd make a better job than he did
your eyes didn't match
they will now  the herder mumbled maledictions after him but pink would not even give him the satisfaction of resenting it
i'd like to have broken a knuckle against his teeth darn him he observed ruefully when he was in the saddle again
come on weary
it won't take but a minute to hand a punch or two to that bugkiller and then i'll feel better
they've both got it comingcome on this because weary showed a strong inclination to take the trail and keep it to his destination
well i'll go alone then
i've got to kinda square myself for the way i threw it into andy and you know blamed well weary they played it lowdown on him or they'd never have got that rope on him
and i'm going to lick that  mamma
you sure are a rambunctious person when you feel that way  weary made querulous comment but he rode over with pink to where the bugkiller was standing with his long stick held in a somewhat menacing manner and once more he held pink's horse for him
pink was gone longer this time and he came back with a cut lip and a large lump on his forehead the bugkiller had thrown a small rock with the precision which comes of much practicesuch as stoning disobedient dogs and the likeand when pink rushed at him furiously the herder caught him very neatly alongside the head with his stick
these little amenities serving merely to whet pink's appetite for battle he stopped long enough to thrash that particular herder very thoroughly and to his own complete satisfaction
well i guess i'm ready to go on now he observed dimpling rather onesidedly as he got back on his horse
i thought maybe you'd want to whip the dogs too weary told him dryly which was the nearest he came to expressing any disapproval of the incident
weary was a peaceloving soul whenever peace was compatible with selfrespect and it would never have occurred to him to punish strange men as summarily as pink had done
i would if the dogs were half as ornery as the men pink retorted
say they hang together like bull snakes and rattlers don't they
if they was human they'd have helped each other outbut nothing doing
do you reckon a man could ride up to a couple of our bunch and thrash one at a time without the other fellow having something to say about it he turned in the saddle and looked back
so help me josephine i've got a good mind to go back and lick them again for not hanging together like they ought to but the threat was an idle one and they went on to denson's weary still with that anxious look in his eyes and pink quite complacent over his exploit
in denson coulee was an unwonted atmosphere of activity heretofore the place had been animated chiefly by young densons engaged in the pursuit of pleasure but now a covered buggy evidently just arrived bore mute witness to the new order of things
there were more horses about the place a covered wagon or two three or four men working upon the corral and lastly there was one whom weary recognized the moment he caught sight of him
looks like a sheep outfit all right he said somberly
and if that ain't old dunk himself it's the devil and that's next thing to him  dunk they judged had just arrived with another man whom they did not know a tall man with light hair that hung lank to his collar a thin sharpnosed face and a wide mouth which stretched easily into a smile but which was none the pleasanter for that
when he turned inquiringly toward them they saw that he was stoopshouldered though not from any deformity but from sheer slouching lankness
dunk gave them a swift sour look from under his eyebrows and went on
weary rode straight past the lank man whom he judged to be oleson and overtook dunk whittaker himself
hello dunk he said cheerfully sliding over in the saddle so that a foot hung free of the stirrup as men who ride much have learned to do when they stop for a chat thereby resting while they may
back on the old stamping ground are you  since you see me here i suppose i am dunk made churlish response
do you happen to own those dot sheep back there on the hill weary tilted his head toward home
i happen to own half of them by then they had reached the gate and dunk passed through and started on to the house
oh don't be in a rushcome on back and be sociable weary called out in the mildest of tones twisting the reins around his saddlehorn so that he might roll a cigarette at ease
dunk remembered perhaps certain things he had learned when he was j g whitmore's partner and had more or less to do with the charter members of the happy family
he came back and stood by the gate ungraciously enough to be sure still he came back
weary smiled under cover of lighting his cigarette
dunk by that reluctant compliance betrayed something which weary had been rather anxious to know
we've been having a little trouble with those sheep of yours weary remarked between puffs
you've got some poor excuses for humans herding them
they drove the bunch across our coulee just exactly three times
there ain't enough grass left in our lower field to graze a prairie dog he glanced back to see where pink was saw that he was close behind as was the lank man and spoke in a tone that included them all
the flying u ain't pasturing sheep this spring he informed them pleasantly
but seeing the grass is eat up we'll let yuh pay for it
why didn't you bring them in along the trail anyway  i didn't bring them in
i just came down from butte today
i suppose the herders brought them out where the feed was best they did if they're worth their wages  they happened to strike some feed that was pretty expensive
and  he smiled down at whittaker misleadingly you ought to keep an eye on those herders or they might let you in for another grass bill
the flying u has got quite a lot of range right around here you recollect
and we've got plenty of cattle to eat it
we don't need any help to keep the grass down so we can ride through it  now look here began the lank man with that sort of persuasiveness which can turn instantly into bluster all this is pure foolishness you know
we're here to stay
we've bought this place and some other land to go with it and we expect to stay right here and make a living
it happens that we expect to make a living off of sheep
now we don't want to start in by quarreling with our neighbors and we don't want our neighbors to start any quarrel with us
all we want  mamma
you're taking a fine way to make us love yuh weary cut in ironically
i know what you want
you want the same as every other meek and lovely sheepman wants
you want it allcore seeds and peeling
dunk he said with a more impatient disgust than he was in the habit of showing for his fellowmen this man's a stranger but i should think you'd know better than to come in here with sheep  i don't know why a sheep outfit isn't exactly as good as a cow outfit and i don't know why they haven't as much right here
you're welcome to what land you own but it always seemed to me that public land is open to the use of the public
now as oleson says we expect to raise sheep here and we expect your outfit to leave us alone
as far as our sheep crossing your coulee is concernedi don't know that they did
but if they did and if they did any damage let j g do the talking about that
i deal with the ownersnot with the hired men  weary you must understand was never a bellicose young man
but for all that he leaned over and gave dunk a slap on the jaw which must have stung considerablyand the full reason for his violence lay four years behind the two when dunk was part owner of the flying u and when his sneering arrogance had been very hard to endure
are you going to swallow thatfrom a hired man weary inquired after a minute during which nothing whatever occurred beyond the slow reddening of dunk's face
i'm not going to fight if that's what you mean dunk sneered
i decline to bring myself down to your level
one doesn't expect anything from a jackass but a bray you knowand one doesn't feel compelled to bray because the jackass does he smiled that supercilious smile which weary had hated of old and which he knew was well used to covering much treachery and small meannesses of various sorts
as i said if the flying u has any claim against us let the owner present it in the usual way dunk drew down his black brows lifted a corner of his lip and turned his back deliberately upon them
oleson let himself through the gate which he closed somewhat hastily behind him
i'm sorry you fellows seem to want to make trouble he said without looking up from the latch which seemed somewhat out of repair like the rest of the denson property
that's a poor way to start in with new neighbors he lifted his hat with what pink considered insulting politeness and followed dunk into the house
weary waited there until they had gone in and closed the door then turned and rode back home again frowning thoughtfully at the trail ahead of them all the way and making no reply to pink's importunings for war
i'd hate to say you've lost your nerve weary pink cried at last in sheer desperation
but why the devil didn't you get down and thump the daylights out of that black sonofagun
i came pretty near walking into him myself only i hate to butt into another fellow's scrap
but if i'd known you were going to set there and let him walk off with that sneer on his face  i can't fight a man that won't hit back weary protested
you couldn't either cadwalloper
you'd have done just what i did you'd have let him go  he will hit back all right enough pink retorted passionately
he'll do it when you ain't looking though
he  i know it weary sighed
i'm kinda sorry now i slapped him
he'll hit backbut he won't hit me he'll aim at the outfit
if the old man was here or chip i'd feel a whole lot easier in my mind  they couldn't do anything you can't do pink assured him loyally forgetting his petulance when he saw the careworn look in weary's face
all they can do is gobble all the range around hereand i guess there's a few of us that will have a word or two to say about that  what makes me sore weary confided is knowing that dunk isn't thinking altogether of the dollar end of it
he's tickled to death to get a whack at the outfit
and i hate to see him get away with it but i guess we'll have to stand for it  that sentiment did not please pink nor when weary repeated it later that evening in the bunkhouse did it please the happy family
the less pleasing it was because it was perfectly true and every man of them knew it
beyond keeping the sheep off flying u land there was nothing they could do without stepping over the line into lawlessnessand while they were not in any sense a meek happy family they were far more lawabiding than their conversation that night made them appear
chapter ix
more sheep  the next week was a time of harassment for the flying u a week filled to overflowing with petty irritations traceable directly or indirectly to their new neighbors the dot sheepmen
the band in charge of the bugchaser and that other unlovable man from wyoming fed just as close to the flying u boundary as their guardians dared let them feed a great deal closer than was good for the tempers of the happy family who rode fretfully here and there upon their own business and at the same time tried to keep an eye upon their unsavory neighborsa proceeding as nerveracking as it was futile
the native son riding home in jingling haste from dry lake whither he had hurried one afternoon in the hope of cheering news from chicago reported another trainload of dots on the wide level beyond antelope coulee
there were he said four men in charge of the band and he believed they carried guns though he was not positive of that
they were moving slowly and he thought they would not attempt to cross flying u coulee before the next day though from the course they were taking he was sure they meant to cross
coupled with that bit of illtidings the brief note from chip saying very little about the old man but implying a good deal by its very omissions would have been enough to send the happy family to sleepless beds that night if they had been the kind to endure with silent fortitude their troubles
if you fellers would back me up brooded big medicine down by the corral after supper i'd see to it them sheep never gits across the coulee by cripes
i'd send 'em so far the other way they'd git plumb turned around and forgit they ever wanted to go south  it's all dunk's devilishness jack bates declared
he could take them in the other way even if the feed ain't so good along the trail
it's most all prairiedog townsbut that's good enough for sheep jack in his intense partisanship spoke as if sheep were not entitled to decent grass at any time or under any circumstances
them herders packin' guns looks to me like they're goin' to make trouble if they kin gloomed happy jack
i betche they'll kill somebody before they're through
when sheepmen gits mean  pink picked up his rope and started for the large corral where a few saddle horses had been driven in just before supper and had not yet been turned out
you fellows can stand around and chew the rag if you want to he said caustically and wait for weary to make a wartalk
but i'm going to keep cases on them dots if i have to stand an allnight guard on 'em
i don't blame weary he's looking out for the lawandorder businessand that's all right
but i'm not in charge of the outfit
i'm going to do as i darn please and if they don't like my style they can give me my time  good for you little one big medicine hurried to overtake him so that he might slap him on the shoulder with his favorite sledgehammer method of signifying his approval of a man's sentiments
honest to grandma i was just b'ginnin' to think this bunch was gitting all streaked up with yeller
'course we ain't goin' to wait for no official orders by cripes
i'd ruther lock weary up in the blacksmith shop than let him tell us to go ahead
go awn and tell him a good stiff lie andyjust to keep him interested while us fellers make a gitaway
he ain't in on this we don't want him in on it  what yuh goin' to do happy jack inquired suspiciously
yuh can't go and monkey with them sheep er them herders
they ain't on our land
and if you don't git killed old dunk'll fix yuh like he fixed the gordon boysi know himto a fareyouwell
it'd tickle him to death to git something on us fellers
i betche that's what he's aiming t'do
git us to fightin' his outfit so's't  oh go off and lie down andy implored him contemptuously
we're going to hang those herders and drive the sheep all over a cutback somewhere like jesus done to the hogs and then we're going over and murder old dunk if he's at home and burn the house to hide the guilty deed
and if the sheriff comes snooping around asking disagreeable questions we'll all swear you done it
so now you know our plans shut your face and go on to bed
and be sure he added witheringly you pull the soogans over your head so you won't hear the dying shriek of our victims
we're liable to get kinda excited and torture 'em a while before we kill 'em  aw gwan gulped happy jack mechanically
you make me sick
if yuh think i'm goin' to swaller all that you're away off
you wouldn't dast do nothing of the kind and if yuh did you'd sure have a sweet time layin' it onto me  oh i don't know drawled the native son with a slow velveteyed glance any jury in the country would hang you on your looks happy
i knew a man down in the lower part of california who was arrested tried and hanged for murder
and all the evidence there was against him was the fact that he was seen within five miles of the place on the same day the murder was committed and his face
they had an expert physiognomist there and he swore that the fellow had the face of a murderer the poor devil looked like a criminaland though he had one of the best lawyers on the coast it was adios for him  i s'pose you mean i got the face of a criminal sputtered happy jack
it ain't always the purty fellers that wins outlike you 'n' pink
i never seen the purty man yit that was worth the powder it'd take to blow him up
aw you fellers make me sick he went off muttering his opinion of them all and particularly of the native son who smiled while he listened
you go awn and start somethingand you'll wisht you hadn't they heard him croak from the big gate and chuckled over his wrath
as a matter of fact the happy family as a whole or as individuals had no intention of committing any great violence that evening
pink wanted to see just where this new band of sheep was spending the night and to find out if possible what were the herders' intentions
since the boys were all restless under their worry and since there is a contagious element in seeking a troublezone none save happy jack who was sore at them and weary stayed behind in the coulee with old patsy while the others rode away up the grade and out toward antelope coulee beyond
they meant only to reconnoiter and to warn the herders against attempting to cross flying u coulee though they were not exactly sure that they would be perfectly polite or that they would confine themselves rigidly to the language they were wont to employ at dances
andy green in particular seemed rather to look forward with pleasure to the meeting
andy by the way had remained heartbrokenly passive during that whole week because weary had extracted from him a promise which andy mendacious though he had the name of being felt constrained to keep intact
though of a truth it irked him much to think of two sheepherders walking abroad unpunished for their outrage upon his person
weary as he had made plain to them all wanted to avoid trouble if it were possible to do so
and though they grinned together in secret over his own affair with dunkwhich was not in their opinion exactly pacificthey meant to respect his wishes as far as human nature was able to do so
so that the happy family galloping toward the red sunset and the great gray blot on the prairie just where the glory of the west tinged the grass blades with red were not onehalf as bloodthirsty as they had proclaimed themselves to be
while they were yet afar off they could see two men walking slowly in the immediate vicinity of the huddled band
a hundred yards away was a small tent with a couple of horses picketed near by and feeding placidly
the men turned gazed long at their approach and walked to the tent which they entered somewhat hastily
look at 'em dodge outa sight will you cried cal emmett and lifted up his voice in the yell which sometimes announced the happy family's arrival in dry lake after a long thirsty absence on roundup
other voices joined in after that first shrill owowoweee of cal's so that presently the whole lot of them were emitting nervecrimping yells and spurring their horses into a thunder of hoofbeats as they bore down upon the tent
between howls they laughed picturing to themselves four terrified sheepherders cowering within those frail canvas walls
i'm a rambler and a gambler and far from my hoome and if yuh don't like me jest leave me aloone chanted big medicine most horribly and finished with a yell that almost scared himself and set his horse to plunging wildly
come out of there you lopeared muttonchewers and let us pick the wool outa your teeth shouted andy green telling himself hastily that this was not breaking his promise to weary and yielding to the temptation of coming as close to the guilty persons as he might for while these were not the men who had tied him and left him alone on the prairie they belonged to the same outfit and there was some comfort in giving them a few disagreeable minutes
pink in the lead was turning to ride around the tent still yelling when someone within the tent fired a rifleand did not aim as high as he should
the bullet zipped close over the head of big medicine who happened to be opposite the crack between the tentflaps
the hand of big medicine jerked back to his hip but quick as he was the native son plunged between him and the tent before he could take aim
steady amigo smiled miguel
you aren't a crazy sheepherder  no but i'm goin' to kill off one
git outa my way big medicine was transformed into a coldeyed ironjawed fighting machine
he dug the spurs in meaning to ride ahead of miguel
but miguel's spurs also pressed home so that the two horses plunged as one
big medicine bellowing one solitary oath drew his right leg from the stirrup to dismount
miguel reached out caught him by the arm and held him to the saddle
and though big medicine was a strong man the grip held firm and unyielding
you must think of the outfit you know said miguel smiling still
there must be no shooting
once that begins he shrugged his shoulders with that slight eloquent movement which the happy family had come to know so well
he was speaking to them all as they crowded up to the scuffle
the man who feels the triggeritch had better throw his gun away he advised coolly
i know boys
i've seen these things start before
all hell can't stop you once you begin to shoot
put it up bud or give it to me  the man don't live that can shoot at me by cripes and git away with it
not if he misses killin' me big medicine was shaking with rage but the native son saw that he hesitated nevertheless and laughed outright
call him out and give him a thumping
that's good enough for a sheepherder he suggested as a substitute
perhaps because the native son so seldom offered advice and because of his cool courage in interfering with big medicine at such a time bud's jaw relaxed and his pale eyes became more human in their expression
he even permitted miguel to remove the big wicked colt from his hand and slide it into his own pocket whereat the happy family gasped with astonishment
not even pink would have dreamed of attempting such a thing
well he's got to come out and take a lickin' anyway shouted big medicine vengefully and rode close enough to slap the canvas smartly with his quirt
by all the gods he knew by name he called upon the offender to come forth while the others drew up in a rude halfcircle to await developments
heavy silence was the reply he got
it was as though the men within were sitting tense and watchful like cougars crouched for a spring with claws unsheathed and muscles quivering
you better come out called andy sharply after they had waited a decent interval
we didn't come here hunting trouble we want to know where you're headed for with these sheep
the fellow that cut loose with the gun  aw don't talk so purty
i'm gitting almighty tired just setting here lettin' m' legs hang down
git your ropes boys with one sweeping gesture of his arm big medicine made plain his meaning as he rode a few paces away his fingers fumbling with the string that held his rope
i'm goin' to have a look at 'em anyway he grinned
i sure do hate to see men act so bashful  with his rope free and ready for action big medicine shook the loop out glanced around and saw that andy pink and cal emmett were also ready and with a dexterous flip settled the noose neatly over the iron pin that thrust up through the end of the ridgepole in front
andy's loop sank neatly over it a second later and the two wheeled and dashed away together with pink and irish duplicating their performance at the other end of the tent
the dingy smokestained canvas swayed toppled as the pegs gave way and finally lay flat upon the prairie fifty feet from where it had stood leaving the inmates exposed to the cruel stare of eight unfriendly cowpunchers
four cowering figures they were with guns in their hands that shook
drop them guns thundered big medicine flipping his rope loose and recoiling it mechanically as he plunged up to the group
one man obeyed
one gave a squawk of terror and permitted his gun to go off at random before he fled toward the coulee
the other two crouched behind their bedrolls set their jaws doggedly and glared defiance
pink andy irish big medicine and the native son slid off their horses and made a rush at them
a rifle barked viciously and slim sitting prudently on his horse well in the rear gave a yell and started for home at a rapid pace
considering the provocation the happy family behaved with quite praiseworthy selfcontrol and leniency
they did not lynch those two herders
they did not kill them either by bullets knives or beating to death
they took away the guns however and they told them with extreme bluntness what sort of men they believed them to be
they defined accurately their position in society at large in that neighborhood and stated what would be their future fate if they persisted in acting with so little caution and common sense
at andy green's earnest behest they also wound them round and round with ropes before they departed and gave them some very good advice upon the matter of range rules and the herding of sheep particularly of dot sheep
you're playing big luck if you only had sense enough to know it andy pointed out to the recumbent three before they rode away
we didn't come over here on the warpath and if you hadn't got in such a darned hurry to start something you'd be a whole lot more comfortable right now
we rode over to tell yuh not to start them sheep across flying u coulee because if you do you're going to have both hands and your hats plumb full uh trouble
it has taken some little time and fussing to get yuh gentled down so we can talk to you and i sure do hope yuh remember what i'm saying  oh we'll remember it all right menaced one of the men lifting his head turtlewise that he might glare at the group
and our bosses'll remember it you needn't worry about that none
you wait till  the next man to him turned his head and muttered a sentence and the speaker dropped his head back upon the ground silenced
it was your own outfit started this style of rope trimming so you can't kick about that part of the deal pink informed them melodiously
it's liable to get to be all the rage with us
so if you don't like it don't come around where we are
and say his dimples stood deep in his cheeks
you send those ropes home tomorrow will yuh
we're liable to need 'em  by cripes big medicine bawled
what say we haze them sheep a few miles north boys  oh i guess they'll be all right where they are andy protested his thirst for revenge assuaged at sight of those three trussed as he had been trussed and apparently not liking it any better than he had liked it
they'll be good and careful not to come around the flying uor i miss my guess a mile  the others cast comprehensive glances at their immediate surroundings and decided that they had at least made their meaning plain there was no occasion for emphasizing their disapproval any further
they confiscated the rifles and they told the fellows why they did so
they very kindly pulled a tarpaulin over the three to protect them in a measure from the chill night that was close upon them and they wished them good night and pleasant dreams and rode away home
on the way they met weary and happy jack galloping anxiously to the battle scene
slim it appeared from weary's rapid explanation had arrived at the ranch with his horse in a lather and with a fourinch furrow in the fleshiest part of his leg where a bullet had flicked him in passing
the tale he told had led weary to believe that slim was the sole survivor of that reckless company
mamma
i'm so glad to see you boys able to fork your horses and swear natural that i don't believe i can speak my little piece about staying on your own side the fence and letting trouble do some of the hunting  he exclaimed thankfully
i wish you'd stayed at home and left these blamed dots alone
but seeing yuh didn't i'm tickled to death to hear you didn't kill anybody off
i don't want the folks to come home and find the whole bunch in the pen
it might look as if  you don't want the folks to come home and find the whole ranch sheeped off either and the herders camping up in the white house do yuh  pink inquired pointedly
i kinda think he added dryly those same herders will feel like going away around flying u fences with their sheep
i don't believe they'll do any cutting across  i betche old dunk'll make it interestin' fer this outfit just the same happy jack predicted
tyin' up three men uh hisn like that and ropin' their tent and draggin' it off ain't things he'll pass up
he'll have a possy out hereyou see if he don't  in that case i'll be sorry for you happy purred miguel close beside him
you're the only one in the outfit that looks capable of such a vile deed  oh dunk won't do anything weary said cheerfully
you'll have to take those guns back though
they might take a notion to call that stealing  you forget the native son reminded calmly that we left them three good ropes in exchange  whereupon the happy family laughed and went to offer their unsought sympathy to slim
chapter x
the happy family herd sheep  the boys of the flying u had many faults in common aside from certain individual frailties one of their chief weaknesses was overconfidence in their own ability to cope with any situation which might arise unexpectedly or otherwise and a belief that others felt that same confidence in them and that enemies were wont to sit a long time counting the cost before venturing to offer too great an affront
also they believedand made it manifest in their conversationthat they could even bring the old man back to health if they only had him on the ranch where they could get at him
they maligned the hospitals and chicago doctors most unjustly and were agreed that all he needed was to be back on the ranch where somebody could look after him right
they asserted that if they ever got tired of living and wanted to cash in without using a gun or anything they'd go to a hospital and tell the doctors to turn loose and try to cure them of something
this by way of illustration also as an explanation of their sleeping soundly that night instead of watching for some hostile demonstration on the part of the dot outfit
to a manone never counted happy jack's prophecies of disaster as being anything more than a personal deformity of thoughtthey were positive in their belief that the dot sheepherders would be very very careful not to provoke the happy family to further manifestations of disapproval
they knew what they'd get if they tried any more funny business and they'd be mighty careful where they drove their sheep after this
so with the comfortable glow of victory in their souls they laid them down and when the animated discussion of that night's adventure flagged as their tongues grew sleepclogged and their eyelids drooped they slept in peace save when slim awakened by the soreness of his leg grunted a malediction or two before he began snoring again
they rose and ate their breakfast in a fair humor with the world
one grows accustomed to the thought of sickness even when it strikes close to the affections and with the resilience of youth and hope life adjusts itself to make room for the specter of fear so that it does not crowd unduly but stands halfforgotten in the background of one's thoughts
for that reason they no longer spoke soberly because of the old man lying hurt unto death in chicago
and when they mentioned the dot sheep and men they spoke as men speak of the vanquished
with the taste of hot biscuits and maple syrup still lingering pleasantly against their palates they went out and were confronted with sheep blatting sheep stinking sheep devastating sheep dot sheep
on the south side of the coulee up on the bluff grazed the band
they fed upon the brow of the hill opposite the ranch buildings they squeezed under the fence and spilled a ragged fringe of running gray animals down the slope
half a mile away though the nearest of them were the murmur of them the smell of them the whole intolerable presence of them filled the happy family with an amazed loathing too deep for words
technically that high level stretch of land bounding flying u coulee on the south was open range
it belonged to the government
the soil was not fertile enough even for the most optimistic of dry land farmers to locate upon it and this was before the dryland farming craze had swept the country gathering in all public land as claims
j g whitmore had contented himself with acquiring title to the whole of the flying u coulee secure in his belief that the old order of things would not change in his lifetime at least and that the unwritten law of the range land which leaves the vicinity of a ranch to the use of the ranch owner would never be repealed by new customs imposed by a new class of people
legally there was no trespassing of the dots beyond the two or three hundred which had made their way through the fence
morally however and by right of custom their offense would not be much greater if they came on down the hill and invaded the old man's pet meadows just beyond the little pasture  ladies may read this story so i am not going to pretend to repeat the things they said once they were released from dumb amazement
i should be compelled to improvise and substitutewhich would remove much of the flavor
let bare facts suffice at present
they saddled in haste and in haste they rode to the scene
this they were convinced was the band herded by the bugkiller and the man from wyoming and the nerve of those two almost excited the admiration of the happy family
it did not however deter them from their purpose
weary to look at him was no longer in the mood to preach patience and a turning of the other cheek
he also made that change of heart manifest in his speech when pink his eyes almost black rode up close and gritted at him  well what's the orders now
want me to go back and get the wire nippers so we can let them poor little sheep down into the meadow
maybe we better ask the herders down to have some of patsy's grub too i don't believe they had time to cook much breakfast
and it wouldn't be a bad idea to haze our own stuff clear off the range
i'm afraid dunk's sheep are going to fare kinda slim if we go on letting our cattle eat all the good grass pink did not often indulge in such lengthy sarcasm especially toward his beloved weary but his exasperation toward weary's mild tactics had been growing apace
weary's reply i fear will have to be omitted
it was terribly unrefined
i want you boys to spread out around the whole bunch was his first printable utterance and haze these sheep just as far south as they can get without taking to the river
don't get all het up chasing 'em yourselfmake the men weary did not call them men he called them something very naughty that's paid for it do the driving  and if they don't go drawled the smooth voice of the native son what shall we do amigo
slap them on the wrist  weary twisted in the saddle and sent him a baleful glance which was not at all like weary the sunnyhearted
if you can't figure that out for yourself he snapped you had better go back and wipe the dishes for patsy and when that's done you can pull the weeds out of his radishes
maybe he'll give you a nickel to buy candy with if you do it good before he faced to the front again his harsh glance swept the faces of his companions
they were grinning every man of them and he knew why
to see him lose his temper was something of an event with the happy family who used sometimes to fix the date of an incident by saying it was right after that time weary got mad a year ago last fall or something of the sort
he grinned himself shamefacedly and told them that they were a bunch of noaccount cusses anyway and he'd just about as soon herd sheep himself as to have to run with such an outfit which swept his anger from him and left him his usual self with but the addition of a purpose from which nothing could stay him
he was going to settle the sheep question and he was going to settle it that day
only one injunction did he lay upon the happy family
you fellows don't want to get excited and go to shooting he warned while they were still out of hearing of the herders
we don't want dunk to get anything like that on us savvy  they savvied and they told him so each after his own individual manner
i guess we ought to be able to put the run on a couple of sheepherders without wasting any powder pink said loftily remembering his meeting with them a few days before
one thing surewe'll make a good job of it this time promised irish and spurred after weary who was leading the way around the band
the herders watched them openly and with the manner of men who are expecting the worst to happen
unlike the four whose camp had been laid low the night before these two were unarmed as they had been from the first which in weary's opinion was a bit of guile upon the part of dunk
if trouble cametrouble which it would take a jury to settlethe fact that the sheepmen were unarmed would tell heavily in their favor for while the petty meanness of rangestealing and nagging trespass may be harder to bear than the flourishing of a gun before one's face it all sounds harmless enough in the telling
weary headed straight for the nearest herder told him to put his dogs to work rounding up the sheep which were scattered over an area half a mile across while they fed and when the herder who was the bugkiller made no move to obey weary deliberately pulled his gun and pointed at his head
you move he directed with grim intent and don't take too much time about it either  the bugkiller an unkempt ungainly figure standing with his back to the morning sun scowled up at weary stolidly
yuh dassent shoot he stated sourly and did not move
for answer weary pulled back the hammer also he smiled as malignantly as it was in his nature to do and hoped in his heart that he looked sufficiently terrifying to convince the man
so they faced each other in a silent clash of wills
big medicine had not been saying much on the way over which was unusual
now he rode forward until he was abreast of weary and he grinned down at the bugkiller in a way to distract his attention from the gun
nobody don't have to shoot by cripes he bawled
we hain't goin' to kill yuh
we'll make yuh wisht by cripes we had though b'fore we git through
git to work boys 'n' gether up some dry grass an' sticks
over there in them rosebushes you oughta find enough bresh
we'll give him a taste uh what we was talkin' about comm' over by cripes
i guess he'll be willin' to drive sheep all right when we git through with him
hawhawhawww he leaned forward in the saddle and ogled the bugkiller with horrid significance
git busy with that bresh he yelled authoritatively when a glance showed him that the happy family was hesitating and eyeing him uncertainly
git a fire goin' quick's yuh kini'll do the rest
down in coconino county we used to have a way uh fixin' sheepherders  aw gwan
we don't want no torture business remonstrated happy jack uneasily edging away
yuh don't hey big medicine turned in the saddle wrathfully and glared
when he had succeeded in catching andy green's eye he winked and that young man's face kindled understandingly
well now you hain't runnin' this here show
honest to grandma i've saw the time when a little footwarmin' done a sheepherder a whole lot uh good and it looks to me by cripes as if this here feller needed a dose to gentle him down
you git the fire started
that's all i want you t' do happy
some uh you boys help me rope himlike him and that other jasper over there done to andy
c'mon andyit ain't goin' to take long  you bet your sweet life i'll come on exclaimed andy dismounting eagerly
let me take your rope weary
too bad we haven't got a branding iron  aw we don't need no irons big medicine was also on the ground by then and untying his rope
lemme git his shoes off once and i'll show yuh  the bugkiller lifted his stick snarling like a mongrel dog when a stranger tries to drive it out of the house hurled the stick hysterically as big medicine rope in hand advanced implacably and with a squawk of horror turned suddenly and ran
after him bellowing terribly lunged big medicine straight through the band like a snowplow leaving behind them a wide open trail
say we kinda overplayed that bet by gracious andy commented to weary while he watched the chase
that gazabo's scared silly let's try the other one
that torture talk works fine  in his enthusiasm andy remounted and was about to lead the way to the other herder when big medicine returned puffing the bugkiller squirming in his grasp
tell him what yuh want him to do weary he panted with some difficulty holding his limp victim upright by a greasy coatcollar
and if he don't fall over himself doin' it whyby cripeswe'll take off his shoes  whereupon the bugkiller gave another howl and professed himself eager to drive the sheepwell what he said was that he would drive them to that place which ladies dislike to hear mentioned if the happy family wanted him to
that's all right then
start 'em south and don't quit till somebody tells you to weary carefully let down the hammer of his sixshooter and shoved it thankfully into his scabbard
now you don't want to pile it on quite so thick next time irish admonished big medicine when they turned away from watching the bugkiller set his dogs to work by gestures and a shouted word or two
you like to have sent this one plumb nutty  i betche bud gets us all pinched for that grumbled happy jack
torturing folks is purty darned serious business
you might as well shoot 'em up decent and be done with it  hawhawhawww big medicine ogled the group mirthfully
nobody can't swear i done a thing or said a thing
all i said definite was that i'd take off his shoes
any jury in the country'd know that would be hull lot worse fer us than it would fer him by cripes
hawhawhawww  say that's right yuh didn't say nothin' ner do nothin'
by golly that was purty slick work all right slim forgot his sore leg until he clapped his hand enthusiastically down upon the place as comprehension of bud's finesse dawned upon him
he yelped and the happy family laughed unfeelingly
you want to be careful and don't try to see through any jokes slim till that leg uh yours gets well irish bantered and they laughed the louder
all this was mere byplay a momentary swinging of their mood to pleasantry because they were a temperamentally cheerful lot and laughter came to them easily as it always does to youth and perfect mental and physical health
their brief hilarity over slim's misfortune did not swerve them from their purpose nor soften the mood of them toward their adversaries
they were unsmiling and unfriendly when they reached the man from wyoming and if they ever behaved like boys let out of school they did not show it then
the wyoming man was wiser than his fellow
he had been given several minutes grace in which to meditate upon the unwisdom of defiance and he had seen the bugkiller change abruptly from sullenness to terror and afterward to abject obedience
he did not know what they had said to him or what they had done but he knew the bugkiller was a hard man to stampede
and he was one man and they were many also he judged that being human and this being the third offense of the dot sheep under his care it would be extremely unsafe to trust that their indignation would vent itself in mere words
therefore when weary told him to get the stragglers back through the fence and up on the level he stopped only long enough for a good look at their faces
after that he called his dogs and crawled through the fence
it really did not require the entire family to force those sheep south that morning
but weary's jaw was set as was his heart upon a thorough cleaning of that particular bit of range and since he did not definitely request any man to turn back and every fellow there was minded to see the thing to a finish they straggled out behind the trailing two thousandand never had one bunch of sheep so efficient a convoy
after the first few miles the way grew rough
sheep lagged and the blatting increased to an uproar
old ewes and yearlings these were mostly and there were few to suffer more than hunger and thirst perhaps
so weary was merciless and drove them forward without a stop until the first jumble of hills and deepworn gullies held them back from easy traveling
but the happy family had not ridden those breaks for cattle all these years to be hindered by rough going
weary when the band stopped and huddled blatting incessantly against a sheer wall of sandstone and gravel got the herders together and told them what he wanted
you take 'em down that slope till you come to the second little coulee
don't go up the first onethat's a blind pocket
in the second coulee up a mile or so there's a spring creek
you can hold 'em there on water for half an hour
that's more than any of yuh deserve
haze 'em down there  the herders did not know it but that second coulee was the rude gateway to an intricate system of high ridges and winding waterways that would later be dry as a bleached bonethe real beginning of the bad lands which border the missouri river for long terrible miles
down there it is possible for two men to reach places where they may converse quite easily across a chasm and yet be compelled to ride fifteen or twenty miles perhaps in order to shake hands
yet even in that scrapheap of nature there are ways of passing deep into the heart of the upheaval
the happy family knew those ways as they knew the most complicated figures of the quadrilles they danced so lightfootedly with the girls of the bear paw country
when they forced the sheep and their herders out of the coulee weary had indicated he sent irish and pink ahead to point the way and he told them to head for the wash bowl which they did with praiseworthy zeal and scant pity for the sheep
when at last after a slow heartbreaking climb up a long bare ridge pink and irish paused upon the brow of a slope and let the trailweary band spill itself reluctantly down the steep slope beyond the sun stood high in the blue above them and their stomachs clamored for food by which signs they knew that it must be near noon
when the last sheep had passed blatting discordantly down the bluff weary halted the sweating herders for a parting admonition
we don't aim to deal you any more misery for a while if you stay where you're at
you're only working for a living like the rest of usbut i must say i don't admire your trade none
anyway i'll send some of your bunch down here with grub and beds
this is good enough range for sheep
you keep away from the flying u and nobody'll bother you
over there in them trees he added pointing a gloved finger toward a little grove on the far side of the basin you'll find a cabin and water
and farther down the river there's pretty good grass in the little bottoms
now git  the herders looked as if they would enjoy murdering them all but they did not say a word
with their dogs at heel they scrambled down the bluff in the wake of their sheep and the happy family rolling cigarettes while they watched them depart told one another that this settled that bunch they wouldn't bed down in the flying u dooryard that night anyway
chapter xi
weary unburdens  hungry with the sharp gnawing hunger of healthy stomachs accustomed to regular and generous feeding tired with the weariness of healthy muscles pushed past their accustomed limit of action and hot with the unaccustomed heat of a blazing day shunted unaccountably into the midst of soft spring weather the happy family rode out of the embrace of the last barren coulee and up on the wide level where the breeze swept gratefully up from the west and where every day brought with it a deeper tinge of green into its grassy carpet
only for this harassment of the dot sheep the roundup wagons would be loaded and ready to rattle abroad over the land
meadow larks and curlews and little perteyed ground sparrows called out to them that roundup time was come
they passed a bunch of feeding flying u cattle and flatribbed bandylegged calves galloped in brief panic to their mothers and from the sanctuary of grassfilled paunches watched the riders with wide inquisitive eyes
we ought to be starting out by now weary observed a bit gloomily to andy and pink who rode upon either side of him
the calf crop is going to be good if this weather holds on another two weeks or so
but he waved his cigarette disgustedly that darned dot outfit would be all over the place if we pulled out on roundup and left 'em the run of things he smoked moodily for a minute
my religion has changed a lot in the last few days he observed whimsically
my idea of hell is a place where there ain't anything but sheep and sheepherders and cowpunchers have got to spend thousands uh years right in the middle of the corrals  if that's the case i'm going to quit cussing and say my prayers every night andy green asserted emphatically
what worries me weary confided obeying the impulse to talk over his troubles with those who sympathized is how i'm going to keep the work going along like it ought to and at the same time keep them dot sheep outa the house
dunk's wise all right
he knows enough about the cow business to know we ye got to get out on the range pretty quick now
and he's so mean that every day or every half day he can feed his sheep on flying u grass he calls that much to the good
and he knows we won't go to opening up any real gunfights if we can get out of it he counts on our faunching around and kicking up a lot of dust maybebut we won't do anything like what he'd do in our places
he knows the old man and chip are gone and he knows we've just naturally got to sit back and swallow our tongues because we haven't any authority
mamma
it comes pretty tough when a lowdown skunk like that just banks on your doing the square thing
he wouldn't do it but he knows we will and so he takes advantage of white men and gets the best of 'em
and if we should happen to break out and do something he knows the herders would be the ones to get it in the neck and he'd wait till the dust settled and bob up with the sheriff he waved his hand again with a hopeless gesture
it may not look that way on the face of it he added gloomily but dunk has got us right where he wants us
from the way they've been letting sheep on our land time and time again i'd gamble he's just trying to make us so mad we'll break out
he's got it in for the whole outfit from the old man and the little doctor down to slim
if any of us boys got into trouble the old man would spend his last cent to clear us and dunk knows that just as well as he knows the way from the house to the stable
he'd see to it that it would just about take the old man's last cent too
and he's using these dot sheep like you'd use a red flag on a bull to make us so crazy mad we'll kill off somebody
that's why he said to them all when he saw that they had ridden up close that they might hear what he was saying i've been hollering so loud for the meekandmild stunt
when i slapped him on the jaw and he stood there and took it i saw his game
he had a witness to swear i hit him and he didn't hit back
and when i saw them dots in our field again i knew just as well as if dunk had told me that he was kinda hoping we'd kill a herder or two so he could cinch us good and plenty
i don't say he qualified with a rueful grin that dunk went into the sheep business just to get rrevenge as they say in shows
but if he can make money running sheepand he can all right because there's more money in them right now than there is in cattleand at the same time get a good whack at the flying u he's the lad that will sure make a running jump at the chance he spat upon the burnt end of his cigarette stub from force of the habit that fear of range fires had built and cast it petulantly from him as if he would like to have been able to throw dunk and his sheep problem as easily out of his path
so i wish you boys would hang onto yourselves when you hear a sheep blatting under your window he summed up his unburdening whimsically
as bud said this morning you can't hang a man for telling a sheepherder you'll take off his shoes
and they can't send us over the road for moving that band of sheep onto new range today
last night you all were kinda disorderly maybe but you didn't hurt anybody or destroy any property
you see what i mean
our only show is to stop with our toes on the right side of the dead line  if andy here would jest git his thinkwheels greased and going good  big medicine suggested loudly he ought to frame up something that would put them dots on the run permanent
i d'no by cripes why it is a feller can always think uh lies and joshes by the dozens and put 'em over o k when there ain't nothing to be made out of it except hard feelin's and then when a deal like this here sheep deal comes up he's got about as many idees by cripes as that there lineback calf over there
honest to grandma andy makes me feel kinda faint
only time he did have a chanc't he let them it occurred to big medicine at that point that perhaps his remarks might be construed by the object of them as being offensively personal
he turned his head and grinned goodnaturedly in andy's direction and refrained from finishing what he was going to say
i sure do like them windflowers scattered all over the ground he observed with such deliberate and ostentatious irrelevance that the happy family laughed even to andy green who had at first been inclined toward anger
everything declared andy in the tone of a paid instructor has its proper time and place boys i've told you that before
for instance i wouldn't try to kill a skunk by talking it to death and i wouldn't be hopeful of putting the run on this dunk person by telling him ghost stories
as to ideasi'm plumb full of them
but they're all about grub just right at present  that started slim and happy jack to complaining because no one had had sense enough to go back after some lunch before taking that long trail south the longer because it was a slow one with sheep to set the pace
and by the time they had presented their arguments against the happy family's having enough brains to last them overnight and the happy family had indignantly pointed out just where the mental deficiency was most noticeable they were upon that last broad stretch of bench land beyond which lay flying u coulee and patsy and dinner a belated dinner to be sure but for that the more welcome
and when they reached the point where they could look away to the very rim of the coulee they saw sheepsheep to the skyline feeding scattered and at ease making the prairie look in the distance as if it were covered with a thin growth of gray sagebrush
four herders moved slowly upon the outskirts and the dogs were little scurrying black dots which stopped occasionally to wait thankfully until the masterminds again urged them to endeavor
the happy family drew up and stared in silence
do i see sheep pink inquired plaintively at last
tell me somebody  it's that bunch you fellows tackled last night said weary miserably
i ought to have had sense enough to leave somebody on the ranch to look out for this  they've got their nerve stated irish after the deal they got last night
i'd have bet good money that you couldn't drag them herders across flying u coulee with a log chain  say by golly do we have to drive this here bunch anywheres before we git anything to eat slim wanted to know distressfully
weary considered briefly
no i guess we'll pass 'em up for the present
an hour or so won't make much difference in the long run and our horses are about all in right now  so'm i by cripes big medicine attested grinning mirthlessly
this here sheep business is plumb wearin' on a man
'specially he added with a fretful note when you've got to handle 'em gentle
the things i'd like to do to them dots is all ruled outa the game seems like
honest to grandma a little gore would look better to me right now than a dutch picnic before the foam's all blowed off the refreshments
lemme kill off jest one herder weary he pleaded
the one that took a shot at me las' night
purty please  if you killed one weary told him glumly you might as well make a clean sweep and take in the whole bunch  well i won't charge nothin' extra fer that either bud assured him generously
i'm willin' to throw in the other threeand the dawgs too by cripes he goggled the happy family quizzically
nobody can't say there's anything small about me
why down in the coconino country they used to set half a dozen greasers diggin' graves by cripes soon as i started in to argy with a man
it was a safe bet they'd need three or four anyways if old bud cut loose oncet
sheepherders
why they jest natcherly couldn't keep enough on hand securely to run their sheep
they used to order sheepherders like they did woolsacks by cripes
you could always tell when i was in the country by the number uh extra herders them sheep outfits always kep' in reserve
honest to grandma i've knowed two or three outfits to club together and ship in a carload at a time when they heard i was headed their way
and so when it comes to killin' off four why that ain't skurcely enough to make it worth m'while to dirty up m'gun  aw i betche yuh never killed a man in your life happy jack grumbled in his characteristic tone of disparagement but such was his respect for big medicine's prowess that he took care not to speak loud enough to be overheard by that modest gentleman who continued with certain fearsome details of alleged murderous exploits of his own down in coconino county arizona
but as they passed the detested animals thankful that the trail permitted them to ride by at a distance sufficient to blur the most unsavory details even big medicine gave over his deliberate boastings and relapsed into silence
he had begun his fantastic vauntings from an instinctive impulse to leaven with humor a situation which at the moment could not be bettered
just as they had when came the news of the old man's dire plight sought to push the tragedy of it into the background and cling to their creed of optimism they had avoided openly facing the sheep complication squarely with mutual admissions of all it might mean to the flying u
until weary had unburdened his heart of worry on the ride home that day they had not said much about it beyond a general vilification of the sheep industry as a whole of dunk as the chief of the encroaching dots and of the herders personally
but there were times when they could not well avoid thinking rather deeply upon the subject even if they did refuse to put their forebodings into speech
they were not children neither were they to any degree lacking in intelligence
swearing about herders and at them was all very well bluffing threatening pummeling even with willing fists tearing down tents and binding men with ropes might serve to relieve the emotions upon occasion
but there was the grim economic problem which faced squarely the flying u as a cow outfitthe problem of range and water the happy family did not call it by name but they realized to the full what it meant to the old man to have sheep just over his boundary line always
they realized too what it meant to have the old man absent at this timeworse to have him lying in a hospital likely to die at any moment what it meant to have the whole responsibility shifted to their shoulders willing though they might be to bear the burden what it meant to have the general of an army gone when the enemy was approaching in overwhelming numbers
pink when they were descending the first slope of the bluff which was the southern rim of flying u coulee turned and glared vindictively back at the wavering gray blanket out there to the west
when he faced to the front his face had the look it wore when he was fighting
so help me josephine he gritted desperately we've got to clean the range of them dots before the old man comes back or he snapped his jaws shut viciously
weary turned haggard eyes toward him
how he asked simply
and pink had no answer for him
chapter xii
two of a kind  patsy staunch old partisan that he was placed before them much food which he had tried his best to keep hot without burning everything to a crisp and while they ate with ravenous haste he told with german epithets and a trembling lower jaw of his troubles that day
dem sheeps dey coom by der leetle pasture he lamented while he poured coffee muddy from long boiling
looks like dey know so soon you ride away und dey cooms cheeky as you pleece und eats der grass und crawls under der fence and leafs der vool sthicking by der vires
i goes out mit a club py cosh und der sheeps chust looks und valks by some better place alreatty und i throw rocks and yells till mine neck iss sore
und' dose herders dey sets dem by der rock and laugh till i felt like i could kill der whole punch by cosh
und von yells 'hey dutchy pring me some pie alreatty'
und he laughs some more pecause der sheeps dey don't go avay dey chust run around und eat more grass and baaaa  he turned and went heavily back to the greasy range with the depleted coffee pot lifted the lid of a kettle and looked in upon the contents with a purely mechanical glance gave a perfunctory prod or two with a longhandled fork and came back to stand uneasily behind weary
if you poys are goin' to shtand fer dot he began querulously py cosh i von't
py myself i vill go and tell dot dunk w'ittaker vot lowdown skunk i t'ink he iss
sheep's vool shtickin' by der fences efferwhere on der ranch py cosh
dot vould sure kill der old man quick if he see it
shtinkin' off sheeps py our noses all der time till i can't eat no more mit der shmell of dem
neffer pefore did i see vool on der flying u fences py cosh und sheeps baaaain' in der coulee  never had they seen patsy take so to heart a matter of mere business importance
they did not say much to him there was not much that they could say
they ate their fill and went out disconsolately to discuss the thing among themselves away from patsy's throaty complainings
they hated it as badly as did he with weary's urgent plea for no violence holding them in leash they hated it more if that were possible
the native son tilted his head unobtrusively stableward when he caught andy's eye and as unobtrusively wandered away from the group
andy stopped long enough to roll and light a cigarette and then strolled after him with apparent aimlessness secretly curious over the summons
he found miguel in the stable waiting for him and miguel led the way rope in hand across the corral and into the little pasture where fed a horse he meant to ride
he did not say anything until he had turned to close the gate and to make sure that they were alone and that their departure had not carried to the happy family any betraying air of significance
you remember when you blew in here a few weeks or so ago the native son asked abruptly a twinkle in his fathomless eyes
you put up a good one on the boys that time you remember
bluffed them into thinking i was a hero in disguise and that you'd seen me pull off a big stunt of bullfighting and bulldogging down in mexico
it was a fine josh
they believe it yet  andy glanced at him perplexedly
yesbut when it turned out to be true he amended the josh was on me i guess i thought i was just lying when i wasn't
i've wondered a good deal about that
by gracious it makes a man feel funny to frame up a yarn out of his own thinkmachine and then find out he's been telling the truth all the while
it's like a fellow handing out a twentyfour karat gold bar to a rube by mistake under the impression it only looks like one
of course they believe it
only they don't know i just merely hit the truth by accident  the native son smiled his slow amused smile that somehow never failed to be impressive
that's the funny part of it he drawled
you didn't
i just piled another little josh on top of yours that's all
i never throwed a bull in my life except with my lariat
i'd heard a good deal about you andwell i thought i'd see if i could go you one better
and you put that mexico yarn across so smooth and easy i just simply couldn't resist the temptation to make you think it was all straight goods
sabe  andy green did not say a word but he looked exceedingly foolish
so i think we can both safely consider ourselves tophands when it comes to lying the native son went on shamelessly
and if you're willing to go in with me on it and help put dunk on the run he glanced over his shoulder saw that happy jack on horseback was coming out to haze in the saddle bunch and turned to stroll back as lazily as he had come
he continued to speak smoothly and swiftly in a voice that would not carry ten paces
while andy green with brown head bent attentively listened eagerly and added a sentence or two on his own account now and then and smiledwhich he had not been in the habit of doing lately
say you fellers are gittin' awful energetic ain't yuhwranglin' horses afoot happy jack bantered at the top of his voice when he passed them by
better save up your strength while you kin
weary's goin' to set us herdin' sheep aginand i betche there's goin' to be something more'n herdin' on our hands before we git through  i wouldn't be a bit surprised if there was sang out andy as cheerfully as if he had been invited to dance ladies' choice with the prettiest girl in the crowd
wonder what hole he's going to dump this bunch into he added to the native son
by gracious he ought to send 'em just as far north as he can drive 'em without paying duty
i'd sure take 'em over into canada if it was me running the show  it was a mistake the native son volunteered for the whole bunch to go off like we did today
they had those sheep up here on the hill just for a bait
they knew we'd go straight up in the air and come down on those two freaks herding 'em and that gave them the chance to cross the other bunch
i thought so all along but i didn't like to butt in  well weary's mad enough now to do things that will leave a dent anyway andy commented under his breath when from the corral gate he got a good look at weary's profile which showed the set of his mouth and chin
see that mouth
it's hunt the top rail and do it quick when old weary straightens out his lips like that  behind them happy jack bellowed for an open gate and no obstructions and they drew hastily to one side to let the saddle horses gallop past with a great upflinging of dust
pink with a quite obtrusive facetiousness began lustily chanting that it looked to him like a big night tonightwith occasional furtive glances at weary's face for he also had been quick to read those closepressed lips which did not soften in response to the ditty
usually he laughed at pink's drollery
they rode rather quietly upon the hill again to where fed the sheep
during the hour or so that they had been absent the sheep had not moved appreciably they still grazed close enough to the boundary to make their position seem a direct insult to the flying u a virtual slap in the face
and these young men who worked for the flying u and who made its interests right loyally their own were growing very very tired of turning the other cheek
with them the time for profanity and for horseplay bluffing and judicious temporizing was past
there were other lips besides weary's that were drawn tight and thin when they approached that particular band of sheep
more than one pair of eyes turned inquiringly toward him and away again when they met no answering look
they topped a rise of ground and in the shallow wrinkle which had hidden him until now they came full upon dunk whittaker riding a chunky black which stepped restlessly about while he conferred in low tones with a couple of the herders
the happy family recognized them as two of the fellows in whose safe keeping they had left their ropes the night before
dunk looked around quickly when the group appeared over the little ridge scowled hesitated and then came straight up to them
i want you rowdies to bring back those sheep you took the trouble to drive off this morning he began with the even grating voice and the sneering lift of lip under his little black mustache which the older members of the happy family rememberedand hatedso vividly
i've stood just all i'm going to stand of these typically flying u performances you've been indulging in so freely during the past week
it's all very well to terrorize a neighborhood of longhaired rubes who don't know enough to teach you your places but interfering with another man's property is  interfering with anotherwhat big medicine his pale blue eyes standing out more like a frog's than ever upon his face gave his horse a kick and lunged close that he might lean and thrust his red face near to dunk's
another what
i don't see nothin' in your saddle that looks t'me like a man by cripes
all i can see is a smoothskinned slippery vermin i'd hate to name a snake after that crawls around in the dark and lets cheap roughnecks do all his dirty work
i've saw dogs sneak up and grab a man behind but most always they let out a growl or two first
and even a rattler is square enough to buzz at yuh and give yuh a chanc't to sidestep him
honest to grandma i don't hardly know what kinda reptyle y'are
i hate to insult any of 'em by cripes by namin' yuh after 'em
but don't for lordy's sake ever call yourself a man agin  big medicine turned his head and spat disgustedly into the grass and looked back slightingly with other annihilating remarks close behind his wideapart teeth but instead of speaking he made an unbelievably quick motion with his hand
the blow smacked loudly upon dunk's cheek and so nearly sent him out of the saddle that he grabbed for the horn to save himself
oh i seert yuh keepin' yer hand next yer sixgun all the while big medicine bawled
that's one reason i say yuh ain't no man
yuh wouldn't dast talk up to a prairie dog if yuh wasn't all set to make a quick draw
yuh got your face slapped oncet before by a flyin' u man and yuh had it comm'
now you'regittin'itdoneright  if you have ever seen an irate proletarian mother cuffing her offspring over an empty woodbox you may picture perhaps the present proceeding of big medicine
to many a man the thing would have been unfeasible after the first blow because of the horses
but big medicine was very nearly all that he claimed to be and one of his pet vanities was his horsemanship he managed to keep within a fine slapping distance of dunk
he stopped when his hand began to sting through his glove
now you keep your hand away from that gunthat you ain't honest enough to carry where folks can see it but 'ye got it cached in your pocket  he thundered
and go on with what you was goin' t'say
only don't get swellheaded enough to think you're a man agin
you ain't  i've got this to say mere type cannot reproduce the malevolence of dunk's spluttering speech
i've sent for the county sheriff and a dozen deputies to arrest you and you and you damn you he was pointing a shaking finger at the older members of the happy family whom he recognized not gladly but too well
i'll have you all in deer lodge before that lying thieving cattlestealing old man of yours can lift a finger
i'll sheep flying u coulee to the very doors of the white house
i'll skin the range between here and the riverand i'll have every one of you hounds put where the dogs won't bite you he drew a hand across his mouth and smiled as they say satan himself can smile upon occasion
you've done enough to send you all over the road destroying property and assaulting harmless menyou wait
there are other and better ways to fight than with the fists and i haven't forgotten any of you fellowsthere are a few more rounders among you  hey
you apologize fer that by cripes er i'll kill yuh the longest way i know
and that big medicine again laid violent hands upon dunk and that way won't feel good now i'm tellin' yuh
apologize er  say all this don't do any good bud weary expostulated
let dunk froth at the mouth if he wants to what we want is to get these sheep off the range
and he added recklessly so long as the sheriff is headed for us anyway we may as well get busy and make it worth his while
so he stopped silenced by a most amazing interruption
on the brow of the hill when first they had sighted dunk in the hollow something had gone wrong with miguel's saddle so that he had stopped behind and to keep him company andy had stopped also and waited for him
later when dunk was spluttering threats they had galloped up to the edge of the group and pulled their horses to a stand
now miguel rode abruptly close to dunk as rides one with a purpose
he leaned and peered intently into dunk's distorted countenance until every man there struck by his manner was watching him curiously
then he sat back in the saddle straightened his legs in the stirrups and laughed
and like his smile when he would have it so or the little twitch of shoulders by which he could so incense a man that laugh brought a deeper flush to dunk's face reddened though it was by big medicine's vigorous slapping
say you've got nerve drawled the native son to let a sheriff travel toward you
i can remember when you were more timid amigo he turned his head until his eyes fell upon andy
say andy he called
come and take a look at this hombre
you'll have to think back a few years he assisted laconically
in response andy rode up eagerly
like the native son he leaned and peered into eyes that stared back defiantly wavered and turned away
andy also sat back in the saddle then and snorted
so this is the dunk whittaker that's been raising merry hell around here
and talks about sending for the sheriff huh
i've always heard that a lot uh gall is the best disguise a man can hide under but by gracious this beats the deuce he turned to the astounded happy family with growing excitement in his manner
boys we don't have to worry much about this gazabo
we'll just freeze onto him till the sheriff heaves in sight
gee
there'll sure be something stirring when we tell him who this dunk person really is
and you say he was in with the old man once
oh lord he looked with withering contempt at dunk and dunk's glance flickered again and dropped just as his hand dropped to the pocket of his coat
no yuh don't by cripes big medicine's hand gripped dunk's arm on the instant
with his other he plucked the gun from dunk's pocket and released him as he would let go of something foul which he had been compelled to touch
he'll be good or he'll lose his dinner quick drawled the native son drawing his own silvermounted sixshooter and resting it upon the saddle horn so that it pointed straight at dunk's diaphragm
you take weary off somewhere and tell him something about this deal andy
i'll watch this slippery gentleman he smiled slowly and got an answering grin from andy green who immediately rode a few rods away with weary and pink close behind
say by golly what's dunk wanted fer slim blurted inquisitively after a short silence
not for riding or driving over a bridge faster than a walk slim  purred the native son shifting his gun a trifle as dunk moved uneasily in the saddle
you know the man
look at his faceand use your imagination if you've got any    chapter xiii
the happy family learn something  well i hope this farce is about over dunk sneered with as near an approach to his old supercilious manner as he could command when the three who had ridden apart returned presently
perhaps weary you'll be good enough to have this fellow put up his gun and these he hesitated after a swift glance to apply any epithet whatever to the happy family
i have two witnesses here to swear that you have without any excuse assaulted and maligned and threatened me and you may consider yourselves lucky if i do not insist  ah cut that out andy advised wearily
i don't know how it strikes the rest but it sounds pretty sickening to me
don't overlook the fact that two of us happen to know all about you and we know just where to send word to dig up a lot more identification
so bluffing ain't going to help you out a darned bit  miguel you can go with andy weary said with brisk decision
take dunk down to the ranch till the sheriff gets hereif it's straight goods about dunk sending for him
if he didn't we can take dunk in tomorrow ourselves he turned and fixed a cold commanding eye upon the slackjawed herders
come along you two and get these sheep headed outa here  say we'll just lock him up in the blacksmith shop and come on back  andy amended the order after his own free fashion
he couldn't get out in a million years not after i'm through staking him out to the anvil with a logchain he smiled maliciously into dunk's fearyellowed countenance and waved him a signal to ride ahead which dunk did without a word of protest while the happy family looked on dazedly
what's it all about weary irish asked when the three were gone
what is it they've got on dunk
must be something pretty fierce the way he wilted down into the saddle  you'll have to wait and ask the boys weary rode off to hurry the herders on the far side of the band
so the happy family remained perforce unenlightened upon the subject and for that they said hard things about weary and about andy and miguel as well
they believed that they were entitled to know the truth and they called it a smartaleck trick to keep the thing so almighty secret
there is in resentment a crisis when that crisis is reached and the dam of repression gives way the full flood does not always sweep down upon those who have provoked the disaster
frequently it happens that perfectly innocent victims are made to suffer
the happy family had been extremely forbearing as has been pointed out before
they had frequently come to the boiling point of rage and had cooled without committing any real act of violence
but that day had held a long series of petty annoyances and here was a really important thing kept from them as if they were mere outsiders
when weary was gone irish asked pink what crime dunk had committed in the past
and pink shook his head and said he didn't know
irish mentally accused pink of lying and his temper was none the better for the rebuff as anyone can readily understand
when the herders therefore rounded up the sheep and started them moving south the happy family speedily rebelled against that shuffling nibbling desultory pace that had kept them long weary hours in the saddle with the other band
but it was irish who first took measures to accelerate that pace
he got down his rope and whacked the loop viciously down across the nearest gray back
the sheep jumped scuttled away a few paces and returned to its nibbling progress
irish called it names and whacked another
after a few minutes he grew tired of swinging his loop and seeing it have so fleeting an effect and pulled his gun
he fired close to the heels of a yearling buck that had more than once stopped to look up at him foolishly and blat and the buck charged ahead in a panic at the noise and the spat of the bullet behind him
hit him agin in the same place yelled big medicine and drew his own gun
the happy family at that high tension where they were ready for anything caught the infection and began shooting and yelling like crazy men
the effect was not at all what they expected
instead of adding impetus to the band as would have been the case if they had been driving cattle the result was exactly the opposite
the sheep ranbut they ran to a common center
as the shooting went on they bunched tighter and tighter until it seemed as though those in the center must surely be crushed flat
from an ambling feeding company of animals they become a lumpy gray blanket with here and there a long vacuous face showing idiotically upon the surface
the herders grinned and drew together as against a common enemyor as with a new joke to be discussed among themselves
the dogs wandered helplessly about yelped halfheartedly at the woolly mass then sat down upon their haunches and lolled red tongues far out over their pointed little teeth and tilted knowing heads at the happy family
look at the darned things wailed pink riding twice around the huddle almost ready to shed tears of pure rage and helplessness
git outa that
hi
wooppee he fired again and again and gave the rangeold cattleyell the yell which had sent many a tired herd over many a weary mile the yell before which had fled fat steers into the stockyards at shipping time and up the chutes into the cars the yell that had hoarsened many a cowpuncher's voice and left him with a mere croak to curse his fate with a yell to bring resultsbut it did not start those sheep
the happy family riding furiously round and round fired every cartridge they had upon their persons they said every improper thing they could remember or invent they yelled until their eyes were starting from their sockets they glued that band of sheep so tight together that dynamite could scarcely have pried them apart
and the herders sitting apart with grimy hands clasped loosely over hunchedup knees looked on and talked together in low tones and grinned
irish glanced that way and caught them grinning caught them pointing derisively with heaving shoulders
he swore a great oath and made for them calling aloud that he would knock those grins so far in that they would presently find themselves smiling wrongsideout from the back of their heads
pink overhearing him gave a last swat at the waggling tail of a burrowing buck and wheeled to overtake irish and have a hand in reversing the grins
big medicine saw them start and came bellowing up from the far side of the huddle like a bull challenging to combat from across a meadow
big medicine did not know what it was all about but he scented battle and that was sufficient
cal emmett and weary equally ignorant of the cause started at a lope toward the trouble center
it began to look as if the whole family was about to fall upon those herders and rend them asunder with teeth and nails so much so that the herders jumped up and ran like scared cottontails toward the rim of denson coulee a hundred yards or so to the west
mamma
i wish we could make the sheep hit that gait and keep it  exclaimed weary with the first laugh they had heard from him that day
while he was still laughing there was a shot from the ridge toward which they were running the sharp vicious crack of a rifle
the happy family heard the whistling hum of the bullet singing low over their heads quite low indeed altogether too low to be funny
and they had squandered all their ammunition on the prairie sod to hurry a band of sheep that flatly refused to hurry anywhere except under one another's odorous perspiring bodies
from the edge of the coulee the rifle spoke again
a tiny geyser of dust spurting up from the ground ten feet to one side of cal emmett showed them all where the bullet struck
get outa range everybody yelled weary and set the example by tilting his rowels against glory's smooth hide and heading eastward
i like to be accommodating all right but i draw the line on standing around for a target while my neighbors practise shooting  the happy family having no other recourse therefore retreated in haste toward the eastern skyline
bullets followed them overtook them as the shooter raised his sights for the increasing distance and whined harmlessly over their heads
all save one
chapter xiv
happy jack  big medicine irish and pink racing almost abreast heard a scream behind them and pulled up their horses with short stifflegged plunges
a brown horse overtook them a brown horse with happy jack clinging to the saddlehorn his body swaying far over to one side
even as he went hurtling past them his hold grew slack and he slumped head foremost to the ground
the brown horse gave a startled leap away from him and went on with empty stirrups flapping
they sprang down and lifted him to a less awkward position and big medicine pillowed the sweatdampened carroty head in the hollow of his arm
those who had been in the lead looked back startled when the brown horse tore past them with that empty saddle saw what had happened wheeled and galloped back
they dismounted and stood silently grouped about poor ungainly happy jack lying there limp and motionless in big medicine's arms
not one of them remembered then that there was a man with a rifle not more than two hundred yards away or if they did they quite forgot that the rifle might be dangerous to themselves
they were thinking of happy jack
happy jack butt of all their jokes and jibes happy the croaker the lugubrious forecaster of trouble happy jack the ugliest the stupidest the softesthearted man of them all
he had betched there would be someone killed over these dot sheep he had predicted trouble of every conceivable kind and they had laughed at him swore at him lied to him joshed him unmercifully and kept him in a state of chronic indignation never dreaming that the memory of it would choke them and strike them dumb with that horrible dull weight in their chests with which men suffer when a woman would find the relief of weeping
where's he hurt asked weary in the repressed tone which only tragedy can bring into a man's voice and knelt beside big medicine
i dunnothrough the lungs i guess my sleeve's gitting soppy right under his shoulder big medicine did not bellow his voice was as quiet as weary's
weary looked up briefly at the circle of staring faces
pink you pile onto glory and go wire for a doctor
try havre first you may get one up on the nine o' clock train
if you can't get one down on the 'leventwenty from great falls
or there's bentonanyway git one
if you could catch macpherson do it
try him first and never mind a havre doctor unless you can't get macpherson
i'd rather wait a couple of hours longer for him
i'll have a rigno you better get a team from jim
they'll be fresh and you can put 'em through
if you kill 'em he added grimly we can pay for 'em he had his jackknife out and was already slashing carefully the shirt of happy jack that he might inspect the wound
pink gave a last wistful look at happy jack's face which seemed unfamiliar with all the color and all the expression wiped out of it like that and turned away
come and help me change saddles cal  he said shortly
weary's stirrups are too darned long even with the delay he was mounted on glory and galloping toward flying u coulee before weary was through uncovering the wound and that does not mean that weary was slow
the rifle cracked again and a bullet plucked into the sod twenty feet beyond the circle of men and horses
but no one looked up or gave any other sign of realization that they were still the target they were staring with that frowning painfully intent look men have at such moments at a purplish hole not much bigger than if punched by a lead pencil just under the point of happy jack's shoulder blade and at the blood oozing sluggishly from it in a tiny stream across the girlishly white flesh and dripping upon big medicine's arm
hadn't we better get a rig to take him home with irish suggested
weary exploring farther had just disclosed a ragged wound under the arm where the bullet had passed out he made no immediate reply
well he ain't got it stuck inside of 'im anyway big medicine commented relievedly
don't look to me like it's so awful badwent through kinda anglin' and maybe missed his lungs
i've saw men shot up before  awi betche you'dthink it was badif you had it murmured happy jack peevishly lifting his eyelids heavily for a resentful glance when they moved him a little
but even as big medicine grinned joyfully down at him he went off again into mental darkness and the grin faded into solicitude
you'd kick by golly if you was goin' to be hung slim bantered tritely and belatedly and gulped remorsefully when he saw that he was joshing an unconscious man
we better get him home
irish you weary looked up and discovered that irish and jack bates were already headed for home and a conveyance
he gave a sigh of approval and turned his attention toward wiping the sweat and grime from happy's face with his handkerchief
somebody else is goin' to git hit by golly if we stay here slim blurted suddenly when another bullet dug up the dirt in that vicinity
that goldarned fool'll keep on till he kills somebody
i wisht i had m' thirtythirty herei'd make him wisht his mother was a man by golly  big medicine looked toward the coulee rim
i ain't got a shell left  he growled regretfully
i wisht we'd thought to tell the boys to bring them rifles
say slim you crawl onto your hoss and go git 'em
it won't take more'n a minute
there'll likely be some shells in the magazines  go on slim urged weary grimly
we've got to do something
they can't do a thing like this he glanced down at happy jack and get away with it  i got half a box uh shells for my thirtythirty i'll bring that slim turned to go stopped short and stared at the coulee rim
by golly they're comm' over here he exclaimed
big medicine glanced up took off his hat crumpled it for a pillow and eased happy jack down upon it
he got up stiffly wiped his fingers mechanically upon his trouser legs broke his gun open just to make sure that it was indeed empty put it back and picked up a handful of rocks
let 'em come he said viciously
i c'n kill every damn' one with m' bare hands    chapter xv
oleson  say ain't that andy and mig following along behind cal asked after a minute of watching the approach
sure it is
now what  they're drivin' 'em by cripes big medicine under the stress of the moment returned to his usual bellowing tone
who's that tall lanky feller in the lead
i don't call to mind ever seem him before
them four herders i'd know a mile off  that weary shaded his eyes with his hatbrim against the slant rays of the westering sun
that's oleson dunk's partner  his mother'd be aweepin' big medicine observed bodefully if she knowed what was due to happen to her son right away quick
must be him that done the shootin'  they came on steadily the four herders and oleson walking reluctantly ahead with andy green and the native son riding relentlessly in the rear their guns held unwaveringly in a line with the backs of their captives
andy was carrying a rifle evidently taken from one of the menoleson they judged for the guilty one
half the distance was covered when andy was seen to turn his head and speak briefly with the native son after which he lunged past the captives and galloped up to the waiting group
his quick eye sought first the face of happy jack in anxious questioning then miserably he searched the faces of his friends
good lord he exclaimed mechanically dismounted and bent over the figure on the ground
for a long minute he knelt there he laid his ear close to happy jack's mouth took off his glove and laid his hand over happy's heart reached up twitched off his neckerchief shook out the creases and spread it reverently over happy jack's face
he stood up then and spoke slowly his eyes fixed upon the stumbling approach of the captives
pink told us happy had been shot so we rode around and come up behind 'em
it was a cinch
andsay boys we've got the dots in a pocket
they've got to eat outa our hands now
so don't think aboutour own feelings or about he stopped abruptly and let a downward glance finish the sentence
we've got to keep our own hands clean andnow don't let your fingers get the itch bud this because of certain manifestations of a murderous intent on the part of big medicine
oh it's all right to talk if yuh feel like talking big medicine retorted savagely
i don't he made a catlike spring at the foremost man who happened to be oleson and got a merciless grip with his fingers on his throat snarling like a predatory animal over its kill
from behind andy with weary to help pulled him off
i didn't mean toto kill anybody gasped oleson pasty white
i heard a lot of shooting and so i ran up the hilland the herders came running toward me and i thought i was defending my property and men
i had a right to defend  defend hell big medicine writhed in the restraining grasp of those who held him
look at that there
as good hearted a boy as ever turned a cow
never harmed a soul in 'is life
is all your dirty stinkin' sheep an' all your lousy herders worth that boy's life
yuh shot 'im down like a doglemme go boys his voice was husky
lemme tromp the life outa him  i thought you were killing my men or i neveri never meant toto kill oleson shaking till he could scarcely stand broke down and wept wept pitiably hysterically as men of a certain fiber will weep when black tragedy confronts them all unawares
he cowered miserably before the happy family his face hidden behind his two hands
boys i want to say a word or two
come over here andy's voice quiet as ever contrasted strangely with the man's sobbing
he led them back a few pacesweary cal big medicine and slim and spoke hurriedly
the native son eyed them sidelong from his horse but he was careful to keep oleson covered with his gunand the herders too although they were unarmed
once or twice he glanced at that long ungainly figure in the grass with the handkerchief of andy green hiding the face except where a corner fluttering in the faint breeze which came creeping out of the west lifted now and then and gave a glimpse of sunbrowned throat and a quiet chin and mouth
quit that blubbering oleson and listen here andys voice broke relentlessly upon the other's woe
all these boys want to hang yuh without any red tape far as i'm concerned i'm dead willing
but we're going to give yuh a chance
your partner as we told yuh coming over we've got the dead immortal cinch on right now
andwell you can see what you're up against
but we'll give yuh a chance
have you got any family  oleson trying to pull himself together shook his head
well then you can get rid of them sheep can't yuh
sell 'em ship 'em outa herewe don't give a darn what yuh do only so yuh get 'em off the range  yyes i'll do that oleson's consent was reluctant but it was fairly prompt
i'll get rid of the sheep he said as if he was minded to clinch the promise
i'll do it at once  that's nice andy spoke with grim irony
and you'll get rid of the ranch too
you'll sell it to the flying ucheap  but my partnerwhittaker might object  look here oldtimer
you'll fix that part up you'll find a way of fixing it
look hereat what you're up against he waited with pointing finger for one terrible minute
will you sell to the flying u  yyes the word was really a gulp
he tried to avoid looking where andy pointed failed and shuddered at what he saw
i thought you would
we'll get that in writing
and we're going to wait just exactly twentyfour hours before we make a move
it'll take some fine work but we'll do it
our boss here will fix up the business end with you
he'll go with yuh right now and stay with yuh till you make good
and the first crooked move you make andy in unconscious imitation of the native son shrugged a shoulder expressively and urged weary by a glance to take the leadership
irish you come with me
the rest of you fellows know about what to do
andy i guess you'll have to ride point till i get back weary hesitated looked from happy jack to oleson and the herders and back to the sober faces of his fellows
do what you can for him boysand i wish one of you would ride over after pink gets back andlet me know how things stack up will you  incredible as was the situation on the face of it nevertheless it was extremely matteroffact in the handling which is the way sometimes with incredible situations as if since we know instinctively that we cannot rise unprepared to the bigness of its possibilities we keep our feet planted steadfastly on the ground and refuse to rise at all
and afterward perhaps we look back and wonder how it all came about
at the last moment weary turned back and exchanged guns with andy green because his own was empty and he realized the possible need of oneor at least the need of having the sheepmen perfectly aware that he had one ready for use
the native son without a word of comment handed his own silvertrimmed weapon over to irish and rolled a cigarette deftly with one hand while he watched them ride away
does this strike anybody else as being pretty raw he inquired calmly dismounting among them
i'd do a good deal for the outfit myself but letting that man get offsay you fellows up this way don't think killing a man amounts to much do you he looked from one to the other with a queer contemptuous hostility in his eyes
andy green took a forward step and laid a hand familiarly on his rigid shoulder
quit it mig
we would do a lot for the outfit that's the god's truth
and i played the game right up to the hilt i admit
but nobody's killed
i told happy to play dead
by gracious i caught him just in the nick uh time he'd been setting up in another minute to prove it he bent and twitched the handkerchief from the face of happy jack and happy opened his eyes and made shift to growl
yuh purty nearsmothered me t'death darn yuh  dios breathed the native son for once since they knew him jolted out of his eternal calm
god but i'm glad  i guess the rest of us ain't insinuated andy softly and lifted his hat to wipe the sweat off his forehead
i will say that after all he did not
instead he knelt beside happy jack and painstakingly adjusted the crumpled hat a hair's breadth differently
how do yuh feel oldtimer he asked with a very thin disguise of cheerfulness upon the anxiety of his tone
well i could feel a lotbetter without hurtin' nothin happy jack responded somberly
i hope you fellersfeel better now
yuh got 'emtryin' to murderthe hull outfit jes' like itold yuh they would gunshot wounds contrary to the tales of certain sentimentalists do not appreciably sweeten or even change a man's disposition
happy jack with a bullet hole through one side of him was still happy jack
aw quit your beefin' big medicine advised gruffly
a feller with a hole in his lung yuh could throw a calf through sideways ain't got no business statin' his views on nothin' by cripes  aw gwan
i thought you saidit didn't amount t' nothin' happy reminded him anxiety stealing into his face
well it don't
may lay yuh up a day or two wouldn't be su'prised if yuh had to stay on the bedground two or three meals
but look at slim here
shot through the legshattered a bone by cripeslas' night only and here he's makin' a hand and ridin' and cussin' same as any of us t'day
we ain't goin' to let yuh grouch around that's all
we claim we got a vacation comm' to us you're shot up now and that's fun enough for one man without throwin' it into the whole bunch
why a little nick like that ain't nothin' nothin' atall
why i've been shot right through here by cripesbig medicine laid an impressive fingertip on the top button of his trousersand it come out back herehe whirled and showed his thumb against the small of his backand i never laid off but that day and part uh the next
i was sore he admitted goggling happy jack earnestly but i kep' agoin'
i was right in fall roundup an' i had to
a man can't lay down an' cry by cripes jes' because he gets pinked a little  aw that's jest becauseit ain't you
i betche you'd lay 'em downjest like other folks if yuh got shotthrough the lungs
that ain't nojoke lemme tell yuh happy jack was beginning to show considerable spirit for a wounded man
so much spirit that andy green who had seen men stricken down with various ills read fever signs in the countenance and in the voice of happy and led big medicine somewhat peremptorily out of earshot
ain't you got any sense he inquired with fine candor
what do you want to throw it into him like that for
you may not think so but he's pretty bad offif you ask me  big medicine's pale eyes turned commiseratingly toward happy jack
i know he is i ain't no fool
i was jest tryin' to cheer 'im up a little
he was beginnin' to look like he was gittin' scared about it i reckon maybe i made a break sayin' what i did about it so i jest wanted to take the cuss off
honest to gran'ma  if you know anything at all about such things you must know what fever means in such a case
and recollect it's going to be quite a while before a doctor can get here  oh i'll be careful
maybe i did throw it purty strong i won't no more big medicine s meekness was not the least amazing incident of the day
he was a bighearted soul under his bellow and bluff and his sympathy for happy jack struck deep
he went back walking on his toes and he stood so that his sturdy body shaded happy jack's face from the sun and he did not open his mouth for another word until irish and jack bates came rattling up with the spring wagon hurriedly transformed with mattress pillows and blankets into an ambulance
they had been thoughtful to a degree
they brought with them a jug of water and a tin cup and they gave happy jack a long cooling drink of it and bathed his face before they lifted him into the wagon
and of all the hands that ministered to his needs the hands of big medicine were the eagerest and gentlest and his voice was the most vibrant with sympathy which was saying a good deal
chapter xvi
the end of the dots  slim may not have been more curious than his fellows but he was perhaps more singlehearted in his loyalty to the outfit
to him the shooting of happy jack once he felt assured that the wound was not necessarily fatal became of secondary importance
it was all in behalf of the flying u and if the bullet which laid happy jack upon the ground was also the means of driving the hated dots from that neighborhood he felt in his slow phlegmatic way that it wasn't such a catastrophe as some of the others seemed to think
of course he wouldn't want happy to die but he didn't believe after all that happy was going to do anything like that
old patsy knew a lot about sickness and wounds
who can cook for a cattle outfit for twenty years and more and not know a good deal of hurts
old patsy had looked happy over carefully and had given a grin and a snort
py cosh dot vos lucky for you alreatty he had pronounced
so you don't git ploodpoisonings mit fever you be all right pretty soon
you go to shleep yet
if fix you oop till der dochtor he cooms
i seen fellers shot plumb through der middle off dem und git yell
you ain't shot so bad
you go to shleep  so his immediate fears relieved slim's slow mind had swung back to the dots and to oleson whom weary was even now assisting to keep his promise slim grinned widely to himself when he thought of the abject fear which oleson had displayed because of the murder he thought he had done while happy jack obediently played dead
and of dunk whom slim had hated most abominably of old dunk a criminal found out dunk a prisoner right there on the very ranch he had thought to despoil dunk at that very moment locked in the blacksmith shop
perhaps it was not curiosity alone which sent him down there perhaps it was partly a desire to look upon dunk humbledhe who had trodden so arrogantly upon the necks of those below him so arrogantly that even slim the slowwitted one had many a time trembled with anger at his tone
slim walked slowly as was his wont with deadly directness as was his nature
the blacksmith shop was silent closedas grimly noncommittal as a vault
you might guess whatever you pleased about its inmate it was like trying to imagine the emotions pictured upon the face behind a smooth black mask
slim stopped before the closed door and listened
the rusty iron hasp attracted his slow gaze at first puzzling him a little making him vaguely aware that something about it did not quite harmonize with his mental attitude toward it
it took him a full minute to realize that he had expected to find the door locked and that the hasp hung downward uselessly just as it hung every day in the year
he remembered then that andy had spoken of chaining dunk to the anvil
that would make it unnecessary to lock the door of course
slim seized the hanging strip of iron gave it a jerk and bathed all the dingy interior with a soft sunset glow
cobwebs quivered at the inrush of the breeze and glistened like threads of fine gold
the forge remained a dark blot in the corner
a new chisel lying upon the earthen floor became a bar of yellow light
slim's eyes went to the anvil and clung there in a widening stare
his hands white and soft when his gloves were off drew up convulsively into fighting fists and as he stood looking the cords swelled and stood out upon his thick neck
for years he had hated dunk whittaker  the happy family with rare good sense had not hesitated to turn the white house into an impromptu hospital
they knew that if the little doctor and chip and the old man had been at home happy jack would have been taken unquestioningly into the guest chamberwhich was a square threewindowed room off the big livingroom
more than one of them had occupied it upon occasion
they took happy jack up there and put him to bed quite as a matterofcourse and when he was asleep they lingered upon the wide front porch the hammock of the little doctor squeaked under the weight of andy green and the widearmed chairs received the weary forms of divers young cowpunchers who did not give a thought to the intrusion but were thankful for the comfort
andy was swinging luxuriously and drawing the last few puffs from a cigarette when slim purple and puffing audibly appeared portentously before him
i thought you said you was goin' to lock dunk up in the blacksmith shop he launched accusingly at andy
we did averred that young man pushing his toe against the railing to accelerate the voluptuous motion of the hammock
he ain't there
he's broke loose
the chainby golly yuh went an' used that chain that was broke an' jest barely hangin' together
his horse ain't anywheres around either
you fellers make me sick
lollin' around here an' not paying no attention by gollyhe's liable to be ten mile from here by this time when slim stopped his jaw quivered like a dish of disturbed jelly and i wish i could give you his tone choppy every sentence an accusation that should have made those fellows wince
irish big medicine and jack bates had sprung guiltily to their feet and started down the steps
the drawling voice of the native son stopped them ten feet from the porch
twelve or fifteen i should make it
that horse of his looked to me like a drifter  wellare yuh goin' t' set there on your haunches an' let him go  slim by the look of him was ripe for murder
you want to look out or you'll get apoplexy sure andy soothed giving himself another luxurious push and pulling the last little whiff from his cigarette before he threw away the stub
fat men can't afford to get as excited as skinny ones can  aw say
where did you put him andy asked big medicine his first flurry subsiding before the absolute calm of those two on the porch
in the blacksmith shop said andy with a slurring accent on the first word that made the whole sentence perfectly maddening
ah come on back here and sit down
i guess we better tell 'em the how of it
huh mig  miguel cast a slow humorous glance over the four
yeesthey'll have us treed in about two minutes if we don't he assented
go ahead  well andy lifted his head and shoulders that he might readjust a pillow to his liking we wanted him to make a getaway
fact is if he hadn't we'd have beenstrictly up against it
right
if he hadn'thow about it mig
i guess we'd have been to the little rockies ourselves  you've got a sweet little voice irish cut in savagely but we're tired
we'd rather hear yuh say something  ohall right
well mig and i just ribbed up a josh on dunk
i'd read somewhere about the same kinda deal so it ain't original i don't lay any claim to the idea at all we just borrowed it
you see it's like this we figured that a man as mean as this dunk person most likely had stepped over the line somewhere
so we just took a gambling chance and let him do the rest
you see we never saw him before in our lives
all that identification stunt of ours was just a bluff
but the minute i shoved my chips to the center i knew we had him dead to rights
you were there
you saw him wilt
by gracious  yuh don't know anything against him gasped irish
not a darned thingany more than what you all know testified andy complacently
it took a minute or two for that to sink in
well i'll be damned breathed irish
we did chain him to the anvil andy went on
on the way down we talked about being in a hurry to get back to you fellows and i told migso dunk could hearthat we wouldn't bother with the horse
we tied him to the corral
and i hunted around for that bum chain and then we made out we couldn't find the padlock for the door so we decided right out loud that he'd be dead safe for an hour or two till the bunch of us got back
not knowing a darn thing about him except what you boys have told us we sure would have been in bad if he hadn't taken a sneak
fact is we were kinda worried for fear he wouldn't have nerve enough to try it
we waited up on the hill till we saw him sneak down to the corral and jump on his horse and take off down the coulee like a scared coyote
it was quoth the young man unmistakably pleased with himself pretty smooth work if you ask me  i'd hate to ride as fast and far tonight as that hombre will  supplemented miguel with his brief smile that was just a flash of white even teeth and a momentary lightening of his languorous eyes
slim stood for five minutes a stolid stocky figure in the midst of a storm of congratulatory comment
they forgot all about happy jack asleep inside the house and so their voices were not hushed
indeed big medicine's bulllike remarks boomed fullthroated across the coulee and were flung back mockingly by the barren hills
slim did not hear a word they were saying he was thinking it over with that complete mental concentration which is the chief recompense of a slowworking mind
he was methodically thinking it all outand eventually he saw the joke
well by golly he bawled suddenly and brought his palm down with a terrific smack upon his sore legwhereat his fellows laughed uproariously
we told you not to try to see through any more jokes till your leg gets well slim andy reminded condescendingly
say by golly that's a good one on dunk ain't it
chasin' himself clean outa the country by gollyscared plumb to deathand you fellers was only jest makin' b'lieve yuh knowed him
by golly that sure is a good one all right  you've got it give you time enough and you could see through a barbedwire fence patronized andy from the hammock
yes since you mention it i think myself it ain't so bad  aww shut up out there an' let a feller sleep came a querulous voice from within
i'd ruther bed down with a corral full uh calves at weanin' time than be anywheres within ten mile uh you darned mouthy  the rest was indistinguishable but it did not matter
the happy family save slim who stayed to look after the patient tiptoed penitently off the porch and took themselves and their enthusiasm down to the bunkhouse
chapter xvii
good news  pink rolled over in his bed so that he might lookhowever sleepilyupon his fellows dressing more or less quietly in the cool dawnhour
say i got a letter for you weary he yawned stretching both arms above his head
i opened it and read it it was from chip so  what did he have to say  old man any better  how they comm' back here  several voices speaking at once necessitated a delayed reply
they'll be here today or tomorrow pink replied without any circumlocution whatever while he fumbled in his coat pocket for the letter
he says the old man wants to come and the doctors think he might as well tackle it as stay there fussing over it
they're coming in a special car and we've got to rig up an outfit to meet him
the little doctor tells just how she wants things fixed
i thought maybe it was importantit come special delivery pink added naively so i just played it was mine and read it  that's all right cadwalloper weary assured him while he read hastily the letter
well we'll fix up the spring wagon and take it in right away somebody's got to go back anyway with macpherson
hello cal how's happy  all right answered cal who had watched over him during the night and came in at that moment after someone to take his place in the sickroom
waked up on the fight because i just happened to be setting with my eyes shut
i wasn't asleep but he said i was claimed i snored so loud i kept him awake all night
gee whiz
i'd ruther nurse a she bear with the mumps  old man's coming home cal pink announced with more joy in his tone and in his face than had appeared in either for many a weary day
whereupon cal gave an exultant whoop
go tell that to happy  he shouted
maybe he'll forget a grouch or two
say luck seems to be kinda casting loving glances our way againwhat  by golly seems to me pink oughta told us when he come in las' night  grumbled slim when he could make himself heard
you were all dead to the world pink defended and i wanted to be
two o'clock in the morning is a mighty poor time for elegant conversation if you want my opinion  and the main point is you knew all about it and you didn't give a darn whether we did or not irish said bluntly
and weary sneaked in too and never let a yip outa him about things over in denson coulee  oh what was the use asked weary blandly
i got an option out of oleson for the ranch and outfit and all his sheep at a mighty good figurefor the flying u
the old man can do what he likes about it but ten to one he'll buy him out
that is oleson's share which was twothirds
i kinda counted on dunk letting go easy
and he added reaching for his hat once i got the papers for it there wasn't anything to hang around for was there
especially he said with his old sunny smile when we weren't urged a whole lot to stay  remained therefore little save the actual arrival of the old mana pitifully weak old man bandaged and odorous with antiseptics and quite pathetically glad to be back homeand his recovery which was rather slow and the recovery of happy jack which was rapid
for a brief space the flying u outfit owned the dots very brief it was not a day longer than it took chip to find a buyerat a figure considerably above that named in the option by the way
so after a season of worry and trouble and impending tragedy such as no man may face unflinchingly life dropped back to its usual level and the trail of the flying u outfit once more led through pleasant places
