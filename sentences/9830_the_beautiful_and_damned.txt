book one    chapter i   anthony patch  in  when anthony patch was twentyfive two years were already gone since irony the holy ghost of this later day had theoretically at least descended upon him
irony was the final polish of the shoe the ultimate dab of the clothesbrush a sort of intellectual there
yet at the brink of this story he has as yet gone no further than the conscious stage
as you first see him he wonders frequently whether he is not without honor and slightly mad a shameful and obscene thinness glistening on the surface of the world like oil on a clean pond these occasions being varied of course with those in which he thinks himself rather an exceptional young man thoroughly sophisticated well adjusted to his environment and somewhat more significant than any one else he knows
this was his healthy state and it made him cheerful pleasant and very attractive to intelligent men and to all women
in this state he considered that he would one day accomplish some quiet subtle thing that the elect would deem worthy and passing on would join the dimmer stars in a nebulous indeterminate heaven halfway between death and immortality
until the time came for this effort he would be anthony patchnot a portrait of a man but a distinct and dynamic personality opinionated contemptuous functioning from within outwarda man who was aware that there could be no honor and yet had honor who knew the sophistry of courage and yet was brave
a worthy man and his gifted son  anthony drew as much consciousness of social security from being the grandson of adam j patch as he would have had from tracing his line over the sea to the crusaders
this is inevitable virginians and bostonians to the contrary notwithstanding an aristocracy founded sheerly on money postulates wealth in the particular
now adam j patch more familiarly known as cross patch left his father's farm in tarrytown early in sixtyone to join a new york cavalry regiment
he came home from the war a major charged into wall street and amid much fuss fume applause and ill will he gathered to himself some seventyfive million dollars
this occupied his energies until he was fiftyseven years old
it was then that he determined after a severe attack of sclerosis to consecrate the remainder of his life to the moral regeneration of the world
he became a reformer among reformers
emulating the magnificent efforts of anthony comstock after whom his grandson was named he levelled a varied assortment of uppercuts and bodyblows at liquor literature vice art patent medicines and sunday theatres
his mind under the influence of that insidious mildew which eventually forms on all but the few gave itself up furiously to every indignation of the age
from an armchair in the office of his tarrytown estate he directed against the enormous hypothetical enemy unrighteousness a campaign which went on through fifteen years during which he displayed himself a rabid monomaniac an unqualified nuisance and an intolerable bore
the year in which this story opens found him wearying his campaign had grown desultory  was creeping up slowly on  his thoughts ran a great deal on the civil war somewhat on his dead wife and son almost infinitesimally on his grandson anthony
early in his career adam patch had married an anemic lady of thirty alicia withers who brought him one hundred thousand dollars and an impeccable entr into the banking circles of new york
immediately and rather spunkily she had borne him a son and as if completely devitalized by the magnificence of this performance she had thenceforth effaced herself within the shadowy dimensions of the nursery
the boy adam ulysses patch became an inveterate joiner of clubs connoisseur of good form and driver of tandemsat the astonishing age of twentysix he began his memoirs under the title new york society as i have seen it
on the rumor of its conception this work was eagerly bid for among publishers but as it proved after his death to be immoderately verbose and overpoweringly dull it never obtained even a private printing
this fifth avenue chesterfield married at twentytwo
his wife was henrietta lebrune the boston society contralto and the single child of the union was at the request of his grandfather christened anthony comstock patch
when he went to harvard the comstock dropped out of his name to a nether hell of oblivion and was never heard of thereafter
young anthony had one picture of his father and mother togetherso often had it faced his eyes in childhood that it had acquired the impersonality of furniture but every one who came into his bedroom regarded it with interest
it showed a dandy of the nineties spare and handsome standing beside a tall dark lady with a muff and the suggestion of a bustle
between them was a little boy with long brown curls dressed in a velvet lord fauntleroy suit
this was anthony at five the year of his mother's death
his memories of the boston society contralto were nebulous and musical
she was a lady who sang sang sang in the music room of their house on washington squaresometimes with guests scattered all about her the men with their arms folded balanced breathlessly on the edges of sofas the women with their hands in their laps occasionally making little whispers to the men and always clapping very briskly and uttering cooing cries after each songand often she sang to anthony alone in italian or french or in a strange and terrible dialect which she imagined to be the speech of the southern negro
his recollections of the gallant ulysses the first man in america to roll the lapels of his coat were much more vivid
after henrietta lebrune patch had joined another choir as her widower huskily remarked from time to time father and son lived up at grampa's in tarrytown and ulysses came daily to anthony's nursery and expelled pleasant thicksmelling words for sometimes as much as an hour
he was continually promising anthony hunting trips and fishing trips and excursions to atlantic city oh some time soon now but none of them ever materialized
one trip they did take when anthony was eleven they went abroad to england and switzerland and there in the best hotel in lucerne his father died with much sweating and grunting and crying aloud for air
in a panic of despair and terror anthony was brought back to america wedded to a vague melancholy that was to stay beside him through the rest of his life
past and person of the hero  at eleven he had a horror of death
within six impressionable years his parents had died and his grandmother had faded off almost imperceptibly until for the first time since her marriage her person held for one day an unquestioned supremacy over her own drawing room
so to anthony life was a struggle against death that waited at every corner
it was as a concession to his hypochondriacal imagination that he formed the habit of reading in bedit soothed him
he read until he was tired and often fell asleep with the lights still on
his favorite diversion until he was fourteen was his stamp collection enormous as nearly exhaustive as a boy's could behis grandfather considered fatuously that it was teaching him geography
so anthony kept up a correspondence with a half dozen stamp and coin companies and it was rare that the mail failed to bring him new stampbooks or packages of glittering approval sheetsthere was a mysterious fascination in transferring his acquisitions interminably from one book to another
his stamps were his greatest happiness and he bestowed impatient frowns on any one who interrupted him at play with them they devoured his allowance every month and he lay awake at night musing untiringly on their variety and manycolored splendor
at sixteen he had lived almost entirely within himself an inarticulate boy thoroughly unamerican and politely bewildered by his contemporaries
the two preceding years had been spent in europe with a private tutor who persuaded him that harvard was the thing it would open doors it would be a tremendous tonic it would give him innumerable selfsacrificing and devoted friends
so he went to harvardthere was no other logical thing to be done with him
oblivious to the social system he lived for a while alone and unsought in a high room in beck halla slim dark boy of medium height with a shy sensitive mouth
his allowance was more than liberal
he laid the foundations for a library by purchasing from a wandering bibliophile first editions of swinburne meredith and hardy and a yellowed illegible autograph letter of keats's finding later that he had been amazingly overcharged
he became an exquisite dandy amassed a rather pathetic collection of silk pajamas brocaded dressinggowns and neckties too flamboyant to wear in this secret finery he would parade before a mirror in his room or lie stretched in satin along his windowseat looking down on the yard and realizing dimly this clamor breathless and immediate in which it seemed he was never to have a part
curiously enough he found in senior year that he had acquired a position in his class
he learned that he was looked upon as a rather romantic figure a scholar a recluse a tower of erudition
this amused him but secretly pleased himhe began going out at first a little and then a great deal
he made the pudding
he drankquietly and in the proper tradition
it was said of him that had he not come to college so young he might have done extremely well
in  when he graduated he was only twenty years old
then abroad againto rome this time where he dallied with architecture and painting in turn took up the violin and wrote some ghastly italian sonnets supposedly the ruminations of a thirteenthcentury monk on the joys of the contemplative life
it became established among his harvard intimates that he was in rome and those of them who were abroad that year looked him up and discovered with him on many moonlight excursions much in the city that was older than the renaissance or indeed than the republic
maury noble from philadelphia for instance remained two months and together they realized the peculiar charm of latin women and had a delightful sense of being very young and free in a civilization that was very old and free
not a few acquaintances of his grandfather's called on him and had he so desired he might have been persona grata with the diplomatic setindeed he found that his inclinations tended more and more toward conviviality but that long adolescent aloofness and consequent shyness still dictated to his conduct
he returned to america in  because of one of his grandfather's sudden illnesses and after an excessively tiresome talk with the perpetually convalescent old man he decided to put off until his grandfather's death the idea of living permanently abroad
after a prolonged search he took an apartment on fiftysecond street and to all appearances settled down
in  anthony patch's adjustment of himself to the universe was in process of consummation
physically he had improved since his undergraduate dayshe was still too thin but his shoulders had widened and his brunette face had lost the frightened look of his freshman year
he was secretly orderly and in person spick and spanhis friends declared that they had never seen his hair rumpled
his nose was too sharp his mouth was one of those unfortunate mirrors of mood inclined to droop perceptibly in moments of unhappiness but his blue eyes were charming whether alert with intelligence or half closed in an expression of melancholy humor
one of those men devoid of the symmetry of feature essential to the aryan ideal he was yet here and there considered handsomemoreover he was very clean in appearance and in reality with that especial cleanness borrowed from beauty
the reproachless apartment  fifth and sixth avenues it seemed to anthony were the uprights of a gigantic ladder stretching from washington square to central park
coming uptown on top of a bus toward fiftysecond street invariably gave him the sensation of hoisting himself hand by hand on a series of treacherous rungs and when the bus jolted to a stop at his own rung he found something akin to relief as he descended the reckless metal steps to the sidewalk
after that he had but to walk down fiftysecond street half a block pass a stodgy family of brownstone housesand then in a jiffy he was under the high ceilings of his great front room
this was entirely satisfactory
here after all life began
here he slept breakfasted read and entertained
the house itself was of murky material built in the late nineties in response to the steadily growing need of small apartments each floor had been thoroughly remodelled and rented individually
of the four apartments anthony's on the second floor was the most desirable
the front room had fine high ceilings and three large windows that loomed down pleasantly upon fiftysecond street
in its appointments it escaped by a safe margin being of any particular period it escaped stiffness stuffiness bareness and decadence
it smelt neither of smoke nor of incenseit was tall and faintly blue
there was a deep lounge of the softest brown leather with somnolence drifting about it like a haze
there was a high screen of chinese lacquer chiefly concerned with geometrical fishermen and huntsmen in black and gold this made a corner alcove for a voluminous chair guarded by an orangecolored standing lamp
deep in the fireplace a quartered shield was burned to a murky black
passing through the diningroom which as anthony took only breakfast at home was merely a magnificent potentiality and down a comparatively long hall one came to the heart and core of the apartmentanthony's bedroom and bath
both of them were immense
under the ceilings of the former even the great canopied bed seemed of only average size
on the floor an exotic rug of crimson velvet was soft as fleece on his bare feet
his bathroom in contrast to the rather portentous character of his bedroom was gay bright extremely habitable and even faintly facetious
framed around the walls were photographs of four celebrated thespian beauties of the day julia sanderson as the sunshine girl ina claire as the quaker girl billie burke as the mindthepaint girl and hazel dawn as the pink lady
between billie burke and hazel dawn hung a print representing a great stretch of snow presided over by a cold and formidable sunthis claimed anthony symbolized the cold shower
the bathtub equipped with an ingenious bookholder was low and large
beside it a wall wardrobe bulged with sufficient linen for three men and with a generation of neckties
there was no skimpy glorified towel of a carpetinstead a rich rug like the one in his bedroom a miracle of softness that seemed almost to massage the wet foot emerging from the tub  all in all a room to conjure withit was easy to see that anthony dressed there arranged his immaculate hair there in fact did everything but sleep and eat there
it was his pride this bathroom
he felt that if he had a love he would have hung her picture just facing the tub so that lost in the soothing steamings of the hot water he might lie and look up at her and muse warmly and sensuously on her beauty
nor does he spin  the apartment was kept clean by an english servant with the singularly almost theatrically appropriate name of bounds whose technic was marred only by the fact that he wore a soft collar
had he been entirely anthony's bounds this defect would have been summarily remedied but he was also the bounds of two other gentlemen in the neighborhood
from eight until eleven in the morning he was entirely anthony's
he arrived with the mail and cooked breakfast
at ninethirty he pulled the edge of anthony's blanket and spoke a few terse wordsanthony never remembered clearly what they were and rather suspected they were deprecative then he served breakfast on a cardtable in the front room made the bed and after asking with some hostility if there was anything else withdrew
in the mornings at least once a week anthony went to see his broker
his income was slightly under seven thousand a year the interest on money inherited from his mother
his grandfather who had never allowed his own son to graduate from a very liberal allowance judged that this sum was sufficient for young anthony's needs
every christmas he sent him a fivehundreddollar bond which anthony usually sold if possible as he was always a little not very hard up
the visits to his broker varied from semisocial chats to discussions of the safety of eight per cent investments and anthony always enjoyed them
the big trust company building seemed to link him definitely to the great fortunes whose solidarity he respected and to assure him that he was adequately chaperoned by the hierarchy of finance
from these hurried men he derived the same sense of safety that he had in contemplating his grandfather's moneyeven more for the latter appeared vaguely a demand loan made by the world to adam patch's own moral righteousness while this money downtown seemed rather to have been grasped and held by sheer indomitable strengths and tremendous feats of will in addition it seemed more definitely and explicitlymoney
closely as anthony trod on the heels of his income he considered it to be enough
some golden day of course he would have many millions meanwhile he possessed a raison d'etre in the theoretical creation of essays on the popes of the renaissance
this flashes back to the conversation with his grandfather immediately upon his return from rome
he had hoped to find his grandfather dead but had learned by telephoning from the pier that adam patch was comparatively well againthe next day he had concealed his disappointment and gone out to tarrytown
five miles from the station his taxicab entered an elaborately groomed drive that threaded a veritable maze of walls and wire fences guarding the estatethis said the public was because it was definitely known that if the socialists had their way one of the first men they'd assassinate would be old cross patch
anthony was late and the venerable philanthropist was awaiting him in a glasswalled sun parlor where he was glancing through the morning papers for the second time
his secretary edward shuttleworthwho before his regeneration had been gambler saloonkeeper and general reprobateushered anthony into the room exhibiting his redeemer and benefactor as though he were displaying a treasure of immense value
they shook hands gravely
i'm awfully glad to hear you're better anthony said
the senior patch with an air of having seen his grandson only last week pulled out his watch
train late
he asked mildly
it had irritated him to wait for anthony
he was under the delusion not only that in his youth he had handled his practical affairs with the utmost scrupulousness even to keeping every engagement on the dot but also that this was the direct and primary cause of his success
it's been late a good deal this month he remarked with a shade of meek accusation in his voiceand then after a long sigh sit down
anthony surveyed his grandfather with that tacit amazement which always attended the sight
that this feeble unintelligent old man was possessed of such power that yellow journals to the contrary the men in the republic whose souls he could not have bought directly or indirectly would scarcely have populated white plains seemed as impossible to believe as that he had once been a pinkandwhite baby
the span of his seventyfive years had acted as a magic bellowsthe first quartercentury had blown him full with life and the last had sucked it all back
it had sucked in the cheeks and the chest and the girth of arm and leg
it had tyrannously demanded his teeth one by one suspended his small eyes in darkbluish sacks tweeked out his hairs changed him from gray to white in some places from pink to yellow in otherscallously transposing his colors like a child trying over a paintbox
then through his body and his soul it had attacked his brain
it had sent him nightsweats and tears and unfounded dreads
it had split his intense normality into credulity and suspicion
out of the coarse material of his enthusiasm it had cut dozens of meek but petulant obsessions his energy was shrunk to the bad temper of a spoiled child and for his will to power was substituted a fatuous puerile desire for a land of harps and canticles on earth
the amenities having been gingerly touched upon anthony felt that he was expected to outline his intentionsand simultaneously a glimmer in the old man's eye warned him against broaching for the present his desire to live abroad
he wished that shuttleworth would have tact enough to leave the roomhe detested shuttleworthbut the secretary had settled blandly in a rocker and was dividing between the two patches the glances of his faded eyes
now that you're here you ought to do something said his grandfather softly accomplish something
anthony waited for him to speak of leaving something done when you pass on
then he made a suggestion  i thoughtit seemed to me that perhaps i'm best qualified to write  adam patch winced visualizing a family poet with a long hair and three mistresses  
history finished anthony
history
history of what
the civil war
the revolution
whyno sir
a history of the middle ages
simultaneously an idea was born for a history of the renaissance popes written from some novel angle
still he was glad he had said middle ages
middle ages
why not your own country
something you know about
well you see i've lived so much abroad  why you should write about the middle ages i don't know
dark ages we used to call 'em
nobody knows what happened and nobody cares except that they're over now
he continued for some minutes on the uselessness of such information touching naturally on the spanish inquisition and the corruption of the monasteries
then  do you think you'll be able to do any work in new yorkor do you really intend to work at all
this last with soft almost imperceptible cynicism
why yes i do sir
when'll you be done
well there'll be an outline you seeand a lot of preliminary reading
i should think you'd have done enough of that already
the conversation worked itself jerkily toward a rather abrupt conclusion when anthony rose looked at his watch and remarked that he had an engagement with his broker that afternoon
he had intended to stay a few days with his grandfather but he was tired and irritated from a rough crossing and quite unwilling to stand a subtle and sanctimonious browbeating
he would come out again in a few days he said
nevertheless it was due to this encounter that work had come into his life as a permanent idea
during the year that had passed since then he had made several lists of authorities he had even experimented with chapter titles and the division of his work into periods but not one line of actual writing existed at present or seemed likely ever to exist
he did nothingand contrary to the most accredited copybook logic he managed to divert himself with more than average content
afternoon  it was october in  midway in a week of pleasant days with the sunshine loitering in the crossstreets and the atmosphere so languid as to seem weighted with ghostly falling leaves
it was pleasant to sit lazily by the open window finishing a chapter of erewhon
it was pleasant to yawn about five toss the book on a table and saunter humming along the hall to his bath
to  you  beautiful lady  he was singing as he turned on the tap
i raise  my  eyes to  you  beautiful laady my  heart  cries  he raised his voice to compete with the flood of water pouring into the tub and as he looked at the picture of hazel dawn upon the wall he put an imaginary violin to his shoulder and softly caressed it with a phantom bow
through his closed lips he made a humming noise which he vaguely imagined resembled the sound of a violin
after a moment his hands ceased their gyrations and wandered to his shirt which he began to unfasten
stripped and adopting an athletic posture like the tigerskin man in the advertisement he regarded himself with some satisfaction in the mirror breaking off to dabble a tentative foot in the tub
readjusting a faucet and indulging in a few preliminary grunts he slid in
once accustomed to the temperature of the water he relaxed into a state of drowsy content
when he finished his bath he would dress leisurely and walk down fifth avenue to the ritz where he had an appointment for dinner with his two most frequent companions dick caramel and maury noble
afterward he and maury were going to the theatrecaramel would probably trot home and work on his book which ought to be finished pretty soon
anthony was glad he wasn't going to work on his book
the notion of sitting down and conjuring up not only words in which to clothe thoughts but thoughts worthy of being clothedthe whole thing was absurdly beyond his desires
emerging from his bath he polished himself with the meticulous attention of a bootblack
then he wandered into the bedroom and whistling the while a weird uncertain melody strolled here and there buttoning adjusting and enjoying the warmth of the thick carpet on his feet
he lit a cigarette tossed the match out the open top of the window then paused in his tracks with the cigarette two inches from his mouthwhich fell faintly ajar
his eyes were focussed upon a spot of brilliant color on the roof of a house farther down the alley
it was a girl in a red neglig silk surely drying her hair by the still hot sun of late afternoon
his whistle died upon the stiff air of the room he walked cautiously another step nearer the window with a sudden impression that she was beautiful
sitting on the stone parapet beside her was a cushion the same color as her garment and she was leaning both arms upon it as she looked down into the sunny areaway where anthony could hear children playing
he watched her for several minutes
something was stirred in him something not accounted for by the warm smell of the afternoon or the triumphant vividness of red
he felt persistently that the girl was beautifulthen of a sudden he understood it was her distance not a rare and precious distance of soul but still distance if only in terrestrial yards
the autumn air was between them and the roofs and the blurred voices
yet for a not altogether explained second posing perversely in time his emotion had been nearer to adoration than in the deepest kiss he had ever known
he finished his dressing found a black bow tie and adjusted it carefully by the threesided mirror in the bathroom
then yielding to an impulse he walked quickly into the bedroom and again looked out the window
the woman was standing up now she had tossed her hair back and he had a full view of her
she was fat full thirtyfive utterly undistinguished
making a clicking noise with his mouth he returned to the bathroom and reparted his hair
to  you  beautiful lady  he sang lightly  i raise  my  eyes  then with a last soothing brush that left an iridescent surface of sheer gloss he left his bathroom and his apartment and walked down fifth avenue to the ritzcarlton
three men  at seven anthony and his friend maury noble are sitting at a corner table on the cool roof
maury noble is like nothing so much as a large slender and imposing cat
his eyes are narrow and full of incessant protracted blinks
his hair is smooth and flat as though it has been licked by a possibleand if so herculeanmothercat
during anthony's time at harvard he had been considered the most unique figure in his class the most brilliant the most originalsmart quiet and among the saved
this is the man whom anthony considers his best friend
this is the only man of all his acquaintance whom he admires and to a bigger extent than he likes to admit to himself envies
they are glad to see each other nowtheir eyes are full of kindness as each feels the full effect of novelty after a short separation
they are drawing a relaxation from each other's presence a new serenity maury noble behind that fine and absurdly catlike face is all but purring
and anthony nervous as a willo'thewisp restlesshe is at rest now
they are engaged in one of those easy shortspeech conversations that only men under thirty or men under great stress indulge in
anthony seven o'clock
where's the caramel
impatiently
 i wish he'd finish that interminable novel
i've spent more time hungry  maury he's got a new name for it
the demon lover not bad eh
anthony interested the demon lover
oh woman wailingnonot a bit bad
not bad at alld'you think
maury rather good
what time did you say
anthony seven
mauryhis eyes narrowingnot unpleasantly but to express a faint disapproval drove me crazy the other day
anthony how
maury that habit of taking notes
anthony me too
seems i'd said something night before that he considered material but he'd forgotten itso he had at me
he'd say can't you try to concentrate
and i'd say you bore me to tears
how do i remember
maury laughs noiselessly by a sort of bland and appreciative widening of his features
  maury dick doesn't necessarily see more than any one else
he merely can put down a larger proportion of what he sees
anthony that rather impressive talent  maury oh yes
impressive
anthony and energyambitious welldirected energy
he's so entertaininghe's so tremendously stimulating and exciting
often there's something breathless in being with him
maury oh yes
silence and then  anthony with his thin somewhat uncertain face at its most convinced but not indomitable energy
some day bit by bit it'll blow away and his rather impressive talent with it and leave only a wisp of a man fretful and egotistic and garrulous
maury with laughter here we sit vowing to each other that little dick sees less deeply into things than we do
and i'll bet he feels a measure of superiority on his sidecreative mind over merely critical mind and all that
anthony oh yes
but he's wrong
he's inclined to fall for a million silly enthusiasms
if it wasn't that he's absorbed in realism and therefore has to adopt the garments of the cynic he'd behe'd be credulous as a college religious leader
he's an idealist
oh yes
he thinks he's not because he's rejected christianity
remember him in college
just swallow every writer whole one after another ideas technic and characters chesterton shaw wells each one as easily as the last
maurystill considering his own last observation i remember
anthony it's true
natural born fetichworshipper
take art  maury let's order
he'll be  anthony sure
let's order
i told him  maury here he comes
lookhe's going to bump that waiter
he lifts his finger as a signallifts it as though it were a soft and friendly claw
 here y'are caramel
a new voice fiercely hello maury
hello anthony comstock patch
how is old adam's grandson
dbutantes still after you eh
in person richard caramel is short and fairhe is to be bald at thirtyfive
he has yellowish eyesone of them startlingly clear the other opaque as a muddy pooland a bulging brow like a funnypaper baby
he bulges in other placeshis paunch bulges prophetically his words have an air of bulging from his mouth even his dinner coat pockets bulge as though from contamination with a dogeared collection of timetables programmes and miscellaneous scrapson these he takes his notes with great screwings up of his unmatched yellow eyes and motions of silence with his disengaged left hand  when he reaches the table he shakes hands with anthony and maury
he is one of those men who invariably shake hands even with people whom they have seen an hour before  anthony hello caramel
glad you're here
we needed a comic relief
maury you're late
been racing the postman down the block
we've been clawing over your character
dick fixing anthony eagerly with the bright eye what'd you say
tell me and i'll write it down
cut three thousand words out of part one this afternoon
maury noble aesthete
and i poured alcohol into my stomach
dick i don't doubt it
i bet you two have been sitting here for an hour talking about liquor
anthony we never pass out my beardless boy
maury we never go home with ladies we meet when we're lit
anthony all in our parties are characterized by a certain haughty distinction
dick the particularly silly sort who boast about being tanks
trouble is you're both in the eighteenth century
school of the old english squire
drink quietly until you roll under the table
never have a good time
oh no that isn't done at all
anthony this from chapter six i'll bet
dick going to the theatre
maury yes
we intend to spend the evening doing some deep thinking over of life's problems
the thing is tersely called the woman
i presume that she will pay
anthony my god
is that what it is
let's go to the follies again
maury i'm tired of it
i've seen it three times
to dick the first time we went out after act one and found a most amazing bar
when we came back we entered the wrong theatre
anthony had a protracted dispute with a scared young couple we thought were in our seats
dick as though talking to himself i thinkthat when i've done another novel and a play and maybe a book of short stories i'll do a musical comedy
maury i knowwith intellectual lyrics that no one will listen to
and all the critics will groan and grunt about dear old pinafore
and i shall go on shining as a brilliantly meaningless figure in a meaningless world
dick pompously art isn't meaningless
maury it is in itself
it isn't in that it tries to make life less so
anthony in other words dick you're playing before a grand stand peopled with ghosts
maury give a good show anyhow
anthonyto maury on the contrary i'd feel that it being a meaningless world why write
the very attempt to give it purpose is purposeless
dick well even admitting all that be a decent pragmatist and grant a poor man the instinct to live
would you want every one to accept that sophistic rot
anthony yeah i suppose so
maury no sir
i believe that every one in america but a selected thousand should be compelled to accept a very rigid system of moralsroman catholicism for instance
i don't complain of conventional morality
i complain rather of the mediocre heretics who seize upon the findings of sophistication and adopt the pose of a moral freedom to which they are by no means entitled by their intelligences
here the soup arrives and what maury might have gone on to say is lost for all time   night  afterward they visited a ticket speculator and at a price obtained seats for a new musical comedy called high jinks
in the foyer of the theatre they waited a few moments to see the firstnight crowd come in
there were opera cloaks stitched of myriad manycolored silks and furs there were jewels dripping from arms and throats and eartips of white and rose there were innumerable broad shimmers down the middles of innumerable silk hats there were shoes of gold and bronze and red and shining black there were the highpiled tightpacked coiffures of many women and the slick watered hair of wellkept menmost of all there was the ebbing flowing chattering chuckling foaming slowrolling wave effect of this cheerful sea of people as tonight it poured its glittering torrent into the artificial lake of laughter  after the play they partedmaury was going to a dance at sherry's anthony homeward and to bed
he found his way slowly over the jostled evening mass of times square which the chariot race and its thousand satellites made rarely beautiful and bright and intimate with carnival
faces swirled about him a kaleidoscope of girls ugly ugly as sintoo fat too lean yet floating upon this autumn air as upon their own warm and passionate breaths poured out into the night
here for all their vulgarity he thought they were faintly and subtly mysterious
he inhaled carefully swallowing into his lungs perfume and the not unpleasant scent of many cigarettes
he caught the glance of a dark young beauty sitting alone in a closed taxicab
her eyes in the halflight suggested night and violets and for a moment he stirred again to that halfforgotten remoteness of the afternoon
two young jewish men passed him talking in loud voices and craning their necks here and there in fatuous supercilious glances
they were dressed in suits of the exaggerated tightness then semifashionable their turned over collars were notched at the adam's apple they wore gray spats and carried gray gloves on their cane handles
passed a bewildered old lady borne along like a basket of eggs between two men who exclaimed to her of the wonders of times squareexplained them so quickly that the old lady trying to be impartially interested waved her head here and there like a piece of windworried old orangepeel
anthony heard a snatch of their conversation  there's the astor mama
look
see the chariot race sign  there's where we were today
no there  good gracious
  you should worry and grow thin like a dime
he recognized the current witticism of the year as it issued stridently from one of the pairs at his elbow
and i says to him i says  the soft rush of taxis by him and laughter laughter hoarse as a crow's incessant and loud with the rumble of the subways underneathand over all the revolutions of light the growings and recedings of lightlight dividing like pearlsforming and reforming in glittering bars and circles and monstrous grotesque figures cut amazingly on the sky
he turned thankfully down the hush that blew like a dark wind out of a crossstreet passed a bakeryrestaurant in whose windows a dozen roast chickens turned over and over on an automatic spit
from the door came a smell that was hot doughy and pink
a drugstore next exhaling medicines spilt soda water and a pleasant undertone from the cosmetic counter then a chinese laundry still open steamy and stifling smelling folded and vaguely yellow
all these depressed him reaching sixth avenue he stopped at a corner cigar store and emerged feeling betterthe cigar store was cheerful humanity in a navy blue mist buying a luxury   once in his apartment he smoked a last cigarette sitting in the dark by his open front window
for the first time in over a year he found himself thoroughly enjoying new york
there was a rare pungency in it certainly a quality almost southern
a lonesome town though
he who had grown up alone had lately learned to avoid solitude
during the past several months he had been careful when he had no engagement for the evening to hurry to one of his clubs and find some one
oh there was a loneliness here  his cigarette its smoke bordering the thin folds of curtain with rims of faint white spray glowed on until the clock in st anne's down the street struck one with a querulous fashionable beauty
the elevated half a quiet block away sounded a rumble of drumsand should he lean from his window he would see the train like an angry eagle breasting the dark curve at the corner
he was reminded of a fantastic romance he had lately read in which cities had been bombed from aerial trains and for a moment he fancied that washington square had declared war on central park and that this was a northbound menace loaded with battle and sudden death
but as it passed the illusion faded it diminished to the faintest of drumsthen to a faraway droning eagle
there were the bells and the continued low blur of auto horns from fifth avenue but his own street was silent and he was safe in here from all the threat of life for there was his door and the long hall and his guardian bedroomsafe safe
the arclight shining into his window seemed for this hour like the moon only brighter and more beautiful than the moon
a flashback in paradise  beauty who was born anew every hundred years sat in a sort of outdoor waiting room through which blew gusts of white wind and occasionally a breathless hurried star
the stars winked at her intimately as they went by and the winds made a soft incessant flurry in her hair
she was incomprehensible for in her soul and spirit were onethe beauty of her body was the essence of her soul
she was that unity sought for by philosophers through many centuries
in this outdoor waiting room of winds and stars she had been sitting for a hundred years at peace in the contemplation of herself  it became known to her at length that she was to be born again
sighing she began a long conversation with a voice that was in the white wind a conversation that took many hours and of which i can give only a fragment here  beauty her lips scarcely stirring her eyes turned as always inward upon herself whither shall i journey now
the voice to a new countrya land you have never seen before
beauty petulantly i loathe breaking into these new civilizations
how long a stay this time
the voice fifteen years
beauty and what's the name of the place
the voice it is the most opulent most gorgeous land on eartha land whose wisest are but little wiser than its dullest a land where the rulers have minds like little children and the lawgivers believe in santa claus where ugly women control strong men  beauty in astonishment what
the voice very much depressed yes it is truly a melancholy spectacle
women with receding chins and shapeless noses go about in broad daylight saying do this
and do that
and all the men even those of great wealth obey implicitly their women to whom they refer sonorously either as mrs soandso or as the wife
beauty but this can't be true
i can understand of course their obedience to women of charmbut to fat women
to bony women
to women with scrawny cheeks
the voice even so
beauty what of me
what chance shall i have
the voice it will be harder going if i may borrow a phrase
beauty after a dissatisfied pause why not the old lands the land of grapes and softtongued men or the land of ships and seas
the voice it's expected that they'll be very busy shortly
beauty oh
the voice your life on earth will be as always the interval between two significant glances in a mundane mirror
beauty what will i be
tell me
the voice at first it was thought that you would go this time as an actress in the motion pictures but after all it's not advisable
you will be disguised during your fifteen years as what is called a susciety gurl
beauty what's that
there is a new sound in the wind which must for our purposes be interpreted as the voice scratching its head  the voice at length it's a sort of bogus aristocrat
beauty bogus
what is bogus
the voice that too you will discover in this land
you will find much that is bogus
also you will do much that is bogus
beauty placidly it all sounds so vulgar
the voice not half as vulgar as it is
you will be known during your fifteen years as a ragtime kid a flapper a jazzbaby and a baby vamp
you will dance new dances neither more nor less gracefully than you danced the old ones
beauty in a whisper will i be paid
the voice yes as usualin love
beauty with a faint laugh which disturbs only momentarily the immobility of her lips and will i like being called a jazzbaby
the voice soberly you will love it  the dialogue ends here with beauty still sitting quietly the stars pausing in an ecstasy of appreciation the wind white and gusty blowing through her hair  all this took place seven years before anthony sat by the front windows of his apartment and listened to the chimes of st
anne's
chapter ii   portrait of a siren  crispness folded down upon new york a month later bringing november and the three big football games and a great fluttering of furs along fifth avenue
it brought also a sense of tension to the city and suppressed excitement
every morning now there were invitations in anthony's mail
three dozen virtuous females of the first layer were proclaiming their fitness if not their specific willingness to bear children unto three dozen millionaires
five dozen virtuous females of the second layer were proclaiming not only this fitness but in addition a tremendous undaunted ambition toward the first three dozen young men who were of course invited to each of the ninetysix partiesas were the young lady's group of family friends acquaintances college boys and eager young outsiders
to continue there was a third layer from the skirts of the city from newark and the jersey suburbs up to bitter connecticut and the ineligible sections of long islandand doubtless contiguous layers down to the city's shoes jewesses were coming out into a society of jewish men and women from riverside to the bronx and looking forward to a rising young broker or jeweller and a kosher wedding irish girls were casting their eyes with license at last to do so upon a society of young tammany politicians pious undertakers and grownup choirboys
and naturally the city caught the contagious air of entrthe working girls poor ugly souls wrapping soap in the factories and showing finery in the big stores dreamed that perhaps in the spectacular excitement of this winter they might obtain for themselves the coveted maleas in a muddled carnival crowd an inefficient pickpocket may consider his chances increased
and the chimneys commenced to smoke and the subway's foulness was freshened
and the actresses came out in new plays and the publishers came out with new books and the castles came out with new dances
and the railroads came out with new schedules containing new mistakes instead of the old ones that the commuters had grown used to
the city was coming out
anthony walking along fortysecond street one afternoon under a steelgray sky ran unexpectedly into richard caramel emerging from the manhattan hotel barber shop
it was a cold day the first definitely cold day and caramel had on one of those kneelength sheeplined coats long worn by the working men of the middle west that were just coming into fashionable approval
his soft hat was of a discreet dark brown and from under it his clear eye flamed like a topaz
he stopped anthony enthusiastically slapping him on the arms more from a desire to keep himself warm than from playfulness and after his inevitable hand shake exploded into sound
cold as the devilgood lord i've been working like the deuce all day till my room got so cold i thought i'd get pneumonia
darn landlady economizing on coal came up when i yelled over the stairs for her for half an hour
began explaining why and all
god
first she drove me crazy then i began to think she was sort of a character and took notes while she talkedso she couldn't see me you know just as though i were writing casually  he had seized anthony's arm and walking him briskly up madison avenue
where to
nowhere in particular
well then what's the use
demanded anthony
they stopped and stared at each other and anthony wondered if the cold made his own face as repellent as dick caramel's whose nose was crimson whose bulging brow was blue whose yellow unmatched eyes were red and watery at the rims
after a moment they began walking again
done some good work on my novel
dick was looking and talking emphatically at the sidewalk
but i have to get out once in a while
he glanced at anthony apologetically as though craving encouragement
i have to talk
i guess very few people ever really think i mean sit down and ponder and have ideas in sequence
i do my thinking in writing or conversation
you've got to have a start sort ofsomething to defend or contradictdon't you think
anthony grunted and withdrew his arm gently
i don't mind carrying you dick but with that coat  i mean continued richard caramel gravely that on paper your first paragraph contains the idea you're going to damn or enlarge on
in conversation you've got your visvis's last statementbut when you simply ponder why your ideas just succeed each other like magiclantern pictures and each one forces out the last
they passed fortyfifth street and slowed down slightly
both of them lit cigarettes and blew tremendous clouds of smoke and frosted breath into the air
let's walk up to the plaza and have an eggnog suggested anthony
do you good
air'll get the rotten nicotine out of your lungs
come oni'll let you talk about your book all the way
i don't want to if it bores you
i mean you needn't do it as a favor
the words tumbled out in haste and though he tried to keep his face casual it screwed up uncertainly
anthony was compelled to protest bore me
i should say not
got a cousin began dick but anthony interrupted by stretching out his arms and breathing forth a low cry of exultation
good weather
he exclaimed isn't it
makes me feel about ten
i mean it makes me feel as i should have felt when i was ten
murderous
oh god
one minute it's my world and the next i'm the world's fool
today it's my world and everything's easy easy
even nothing is easy
got a cousin up at the plaza
famous girl
we can go up and meet her
she lives there in the winterhas lately anywaywith her mother and father
didn't know you had cousins in new york
her name's gloria
she's from homekansas city
her mother's a practising bilphist and her father's quite dull but a perfect gentleman
what are they
literary material
they try to be
all the old man does is tell me he just met the most wonderful character for a novel
then he tells me about some idiotic friend of his and then he says 'there's a character for you
why don't you write him up
everybody'd be interested in him'
or else he tells me about japan or paris or some other very obvious place and says 'why don't you write a story about that place
that'd be a wonderful setting for a story'
how about the girl
inquired anthony casually gloriagloria what
gilbert
oh you've heard of hergloria gilbert
goes to dances at collegesall that sort of thing
i've heard her name
goodlookingin fact damned attractive
they reached fiftieth street and turned over toward the avenue
i don't care for young girls as a rule said anthony frowning
this was not strictly true
while it seemed to him that the average debutante spent every hour of her day thinking and talking about what the great world had mapped out for her to do during the next hour any girl who made a living directly on her prettiness interested him enormously
gloria's darn nicenot a brain in her head
anthony laughed in a onesyllabled snort
by that you mean that she hasn't a line of literary patter
no i don't
dick you know what passes as brains in a girl for you
earnest young women who sit with you in a corner and talk earnestly about life
the kind who when they were sixteen argued with grave faces as to whether kissing was right or wrongand whether it was immoral for freshmen to drink beer
richard caramel was offended
his scowl crinkled like crushed paper
no he began but anthony interrupted ruthlessly
oh yes kind who just at present sit in corners and confer on the latest scandinavian dante available in english translation
dick turned to him a curious falling in his whole countenance
his question was almost an appeal
what's the matter with you and maury
you talk sometimes as though i were a sort of inferior
anthony was confused but he was also cold and a little uncomfortable so he took refuge in attack
i don't think your brains matter dick
of course they matter
exclaimed dick angrily
what do you mean
why don't they matter
you might know too much for your pen
i couldn't possibly
i can imagine insisted anthony a man knowing too much for his talent to express
like me
suppose for instance i have more wisdom than you and less talent
it would tend to make me inarticulate
you on the contrary have enough water to fill the pail and a big enough pail to hold the water
i don't follow you at all complained dick in a crestfallen tone
infinitely dismayed he seemed to bulge in protest
he was staring intently at anthony and caroming off a succession of passersby who reproached him with fierce resentful glances
i simply mean that a talent like wells's could carry the intelligence of a spencer
but an inferior talent can only be graceful when it's carrying inferior ideas
and the more narrowly you can look at a thing the more entertaining you can be about it
dick considered unable to decide the exact degree of criticism intended by anthony's remarks
but anthony with that facility which seemed so frequently to flow from him continued his dark eyes gleaming in his thin face his chin raised his voice raised his whole physical being raised  say i am proud and sane and wisean athenian among greeks
well i might fail where a lesser man would succeed
he could imitate he could adorn he could be enthusiastic he could be hopefully constructive
but this hypothetical me would be too proud to imitate too sane to be enthusiastic too sophisticated to be utopian too grecian to adorn
then you don't think the artist works from his intelligence
no
he goes on improving if he can what he imitates in the way of style and choosing from his own interpretation of the things around him what constitutes material
but after all every writer writes because it's his mode of living
don't tell me you like this 'divine function of the artist' business
i'm not accustomed even to refer to myself as an artist
dick said anthony changing his tone i want to beg your pardon
why
for that outburst
i'm honestly sorry
i was talking for effect
somewhat mollified dick rejoined  i've often said you were a philistine at heart
it was a crackling dusk when they turned in under the white faade of the plaza and tasted slowly the foam and yellow thickness of an eggnog
anthony looked at his companion
richard caramel's nose and brow were slowly approaching a like pigmentation the red was leaving the one the blue deserting the other
glancing in a mirror anthony was glad to find that his own skin had not discolored
on the contrary a faint glow had kindled in his cheekshe fancied that he had never looked so well
enough for me said dick his tone that of an athlete in training
i want to go up and see the gilberts
won't you come
whyyes
if you don't dedicate me to the parents and dash off in the corner with dora
not doragloria
a clerk announced them over the phone and ascending to the tenth floor they followed a winding corridor and knocked at 
the door was answered by a middleaged ladymrs gilbert herself
how do you do
she spoke in the conventional american ladylady language
well i'm awfully glad to see you  hasty interjections by dick and then  mr pats
well do come in and leave your coat there
she pointed to a chair and changed her inflection to a deprecatory laugh full of minute gasps
this is really lovelylovely
why richard you haven't been here for so longnono
the latter monosyllables served half as responses half as periods to some vague starts from dick
well do sit down and tell me what you've been doing
one crossed and recrossed one stood and bowed ever so gently one smiled again and again with helpless stupidity one wondered if she would ever sit down at length one slid thankfully into a chair and settled for a pleasant call
i suppose it's because you've been busyas much as anything else smiled mrs gilbert somewhat ambiguously
the as much as anything else she used to balance all her more rickety sentences
she had two other ones at least that's the way i look at it and pure and simplethese three alternated gave each of her remarks an air of being a general reflection on life as though she had calculated all causes and at length put her finger on the ultimate one
richard caramel's face anthony saw was now quite normal
the brow and cheeks were of a flesh color the nose politely inconspicuous
he had fixed his aunt with the brightyellow eye giving her that acute and exaggerated attention that young males are accustomed to render to all females who are of no further value
are you a writer too mr pats
 well perhaps we can all bask in richard's fame
gentle laughter led by mrs gilbert
gloria's out she said with an air of laying down an axiom from which she would proceed to derive results
she's dancing somewhere
gloria goes goes goes
i tell her i don't see how she stands it
she dances all afternoon and all night until i think she's going to wear herself to a shadow
her father is very worried about her
she smiled from one to the other
they both smiled
she was composed anthony perceived of a succession of semicircles and parabolas like those figures that gifted folk make on the typewriter head arms bust hips thighs and ankles were in a bewildering tier of roundnesses
well ordered and clean she was with hair of an artificially rich gray her large face sheltered weatherbeaten blue eyes and was adorned with just the faintest white mustache
i always say she remarked to anthony that richard is an ancient soul
in the tense pause that followed anthony considered a punsomething about dick having been much walked upon
we all have souls of different ages continued mrs gilbert radiantly at least that's what i say
perhaps so agreed anthony with an air of quickening to a hopeful idea
the voice bubbled on  gloria has a very young soulirresponsible as much as anything else
she has no sense of responsibility
she's sparkling aunt catherine said richard pleasantly
a sense of responsibility would spoil her
she's too pretty
well confessed mrs gilbert all i know is that she goes and goes and goes  the number of goings to gloria's discredit was lost in the rattle of the doorknob as it turned to admit mr gilbert
he was a short man with a mustache resting like a small white cloud beneath his undistinguished nose
he had reached the stage where his value as a social creature was a black and imponderable negative
his ideas were the popular delusions of twenty years before his mind steered a wabbly and anaemic course in the wake of the daily newspaper editorials
after graduating from a small but terrifying western university he had entered the celluloid business and as this required only the minute measure of intelligence he brought to it he did well for several yearsin fact until about  when he began exchanging contracts for vague agreements with the moving picture industry
the moving picture industry had decided about  to gobble him up and at this time he was so to speak delicately balanced on its tongue
meanwhile he was supervising manager of the associated midwestern film materials company spending six months of each year in new york and the remainder in kansas city and st louis
he felt credulously that there was a good thing coming to himand his wife thought so and his daughter thought so too
he disapproved of gloria she stayed out late she never ate her meals she was always in a mixuphe had irritated her once and she had used toward him words that he had not thought were part of her vocabulary
his wife was easier
after fifteen years of incessant guerilla warfare he had conquered herit was a war of muddled optimism against organized dulness and something in the number of yes's with which he could poison a conversation had won him the victory
yesyesyesyes he would say yesyesyesyes
let me see
that was the summer oflet me seeninetyone or ninetytwoyesyesyesyes  fifteen years of yes's had beaten mrs gilbert
fifteen further years of that incessant unaffirmative affirmative accompanied by the perpetual flicking of ashmushrooms from thirtytwo thousand cigars had broken her
to this husband of hers she made the last concession of married life which is more complete more irrevocable than the firstshe listened to him
she told herself that the years had brought her toleranceactually they had slain what measure she had ever possessed of moral courage
she introduced him to anthony
this is mr pats she said
the young man and the old touched flesh mr gilbert's hand was soft worn away to the pulpy semblance of a squeezed grapefruit
then husband and wife exchanged greetingshe told her it had grown colder out he said he had walked down to a newsstand on fortyfourth street for a kansas city paper
he had intended to ride back in the bus but he had found it too cold yes yes yes yes too cold
mrs gilbert added flavor to his adventure by being impressed with his courage in braving the harsh air
well you are spunky
she exclaimed admiringly
you are spunky
i wouldn't have gone out for anything
mr gilbert with true masculine impassivity disregarded the awe he had excited in his wife
he turned to the two young men and triumphantly routed them on the subject of the weather
richard caramel was called on to remember the month of november in kansas
no sooner had the theme been pushed toward him however than it was violently fished back to be lingered over pawed over elongated and generally devitalized by its sponsor
the immemorial thesis that the days somewhere were warm but the nights very pleasant was successfully propounded and they decided the exact distance on an obscure railroad between two points that dick had inadvertently mentioned
anthony fixed mr gilbert with a steady stare and went into a trance through which after a moment mrs gilbert's smiling voice penetrated  it seems as though the cold were damper hereit seems to eat into my bones
as this remark adequately yessed had been on the tip of mr gilbert's tongue he could not be blamed for rather abruptly changing the subject
where's gloria
she ought to be here any minute
have you met my daughter mr
haven't had the pleasure
i've heard dick speak of her often
she and richard are cousins
yes
anthony smiled with some effort
he was not used to the society of his seniors and his mouth was stiff from superfluous cheerfulness
it was such a pleasant thought about gloria and dick being cousins
he managed within the next minute to throw an agonized glance at his friend
richard caramel was afraid they'd have to toddle off
mrs gilbert was tremendously sorry
mr gilbert thought it was too bad
mrs gilbert had a further ideasomething about being glad they'd come anyhow even if they'd only seen an old lady 'way too old to flirt with them
anthony and dick evidently considered this a sly sally for they laughed one bar in threefour time
would they come again soon
oh yes
gloria would be awfully sorry
goodby  goodby  smiles
smiles
bang
two disconsolate young men walking down the tenthfloor corridor of the plaza in the direction of the elevator
a lady's legs  behind maury noble's attractive indolence his irrelevance and his easy mockery lay a surprising and relentless maturity of purpose
his intention as he stated it in college had been to use three years in travel three years in utter leisureand then to become immensely rich as quickly as possible
his three years of travel were over
he had accomplished the globe with an intensity and curiosity that in any one else would have seemed pedantic without redeeming spontaneity almost the selfediting of a human baedeker but in this case it assumed an air of mysterious purpose and significant designas though maury noble were some predestined antichrist urged by a preordination to go everywhere there was to go along the earth and to see all the billions of humans who bred and wept and slew each other here and there upon it
back in america he was sallying into the search for amusement with the same consistent absorption
he who had never taken more than a few cocktails or a pint of wine at a sitting taught himself to drink as he would have taught himself greeklike greek it would be the gateway to a wealth of new sensations new psychic states new reactions in joy or misery
his habits were a matter for esoteric speculation
he had three rooms in a bachelor apartment on fortyforth street but he was seldom to be found there
the telephone girl had received the most positive instructions that no one should even have his ear without first giving a name to be passed upon
she had a list of half a dozen people to whom he was never at home and of the same number to whom he was always at home
foremost on the latter list were anthony patch and richard caramel
maury's mother lived with her married son in philadelphia and there maury went usually for the weekends so one saturday night when anthony prowling the chilly streets in a fit of utter boredom dropped in at the molton arms he was overjoyed to find that mr noble was at home
his spirits soared faster than the flying elevator
this was so good so extremely good to be about to talk to maurywho would be equally happy at seeing him
they would look at each other with a deep affection just behind their eyes which both would conceal beneath some attenuated raillery
had it been summer they would have gone out together and indolently sipped two long tom collinses as they wilted their collars and watched the faintly diverting round of some lazy august cabaret
but it was cold outside with wind around the edges of the tall buildings and december just up the street so better far an evening together under the soft lamplight and a drink or two of bushmill's or a thimbleful of maury's grand marnier with the books gleaming like ornaments against the walls and maury radiating a divine inertia as he rested large and catlike in his favorite chair
there he was
the room closed about anthony warmed him
the glow of that strong persuasive mind that temperament almost oriental in its outward impassivity warmed anthony's restless soul and brought him a peace that could be likened only to the peace a stupid woman gives
one must understand allelse one must take all for granted
maury filled the room tigerlike godlike
the winds outside were stilled the brass candlesticks on the mantel glowed like tapers before an altar
what keeps you here today
anthony spread himself over a yielding sofa and made an elbowrest among the pillows
just been here an hour
tea danceand i stayed so late i missed my train to philadelphia
strange to stay so long commented anthony curiously
rather
what'd you do
geraldine
little usher at keith's
i told you about her
oh
paid me a call about three and stayed till five
peculiar little soulshe gets me
she's so utterly stupid
maury was silent
strange as it may seem continued anthony so far as i'm concerned and even so far as i know geraldine is a paragon of virtue
he had known her a month a girl of nondescript and nomadic habits
someone had casually passed her on to anthony who considered her amusing and rather liked the chaste and fairylike kisses she had given him on the third night of their acquaintance when they had driven in a taxi through the park
she had a vague familya shadowy aunt and uncle who shared with her an apartment in the labyrinthine hundreds
she was company familiar and faintly intimate and restful
further than that he did not care to experimentnot from any moral compunction but from a dread of allowing any entanglement to disturb what he felt was the growing serenity of his life
she has two stunts he informed maury one of them is to get her hair over her eyes some way and then blow it out and the other is to say 'you craaazy'
when some one makes a remark that's over her head
it fascinates me
i sit there hour after hour completely intrigued by the maniacal symptoms she finds in my imagination
maury stirred in his chair and spoke
remarkable that a person can comprehend so little and yet live in such a complex civilization
a woman like that actually takes the whole universe in the most matteroffact way
from the influence of rousseau to the bearing of the tariff rates on her dinner the whole phenomenon is utterly strange to her
she's just been carried along from an age of spearheads and plunked down here with the equipment of an archer for going into a pistol duel
you could sweep away the entire crust of history and she'd never know the difference
i wish our richard would write about her
anthony surely you don't think she's worth writing about
as much as anybody he answered yawning
you know i was thinking today that i have a great confidence in dick
so long as he sticks to people and not to ideas and as long as his inspirations come from life and not from art and always granting a normal growth i believe he'll be a big man
i should think the appearance of the black notebook would prove that he's going to life
anthony raised himself on his elbow and answered eagerly  he tries to go to life
so does every author except the very worst but after all most of them live on predigested food
the incident or character may be from life but the writer usually interprets it in terms of the last book he read
for instance suppose he meets a sea captain and thinks he's an original character
the truth is that he sees the resemblance between the sea captain and the last sea captain dana created or whoever creates sea captains and therefore he knows how to set this sea captain on paper
dick of course can set down any consciously picturesque characterlike character but could he accurately transcribe his own sister
then they were off for half an hour on literature
a classic suggested anthony is a successful book that has survived the reaction of the next period or generation
then it's safe like a style in architecture or furniture
it's acquired a picturesque dignity to take the place of its fashion  after a time the subject temporarily lost its tang
the interest of the two young men was not particularly technical
they were in love with generalities
anthony had recently discovered samuel butler and the brisk aphorisms in the notebook seemed to him the quintessence of criticism
maury his whole mind so thoroughly mellowed by the very hardness of his scheme of life seemed inevitably the wiser of the two yet in the actual stuff of their intelligences they were not it seemed fundamentally different
they drifted from letters to the curiosities of each other's day
whose tea was it
people named abercrombie
why'd you stay late
meet a luscious dbutante
yes
did you really
anthony's voice lifted in surprise
not a dbutante exactly
said she came out two winters ago in kansas city
sort of leftover
no answered maury with some amusement i think that's the last thing i'd say about her
she seemedwell somehow the youngest person there
not too young to make you miss a train
young enough
beautiful child
anthony chuckled in his onesyllable snort
oh maury you're in your second childhood
what do you mean by beautiful
maury gazed helplessly into space
well i can't describe her exactlyexcept to say that she was beautiful
she wastremendously alive
she was eating gumdrops
what
it was a sort of attenuated vice
she's a nervous kindsaid she always ate gumdrops at teas because she had to stand around so long in one place
what'd you talk aboutbergson
bilphism
whether the onestep is immoral
maury was unruffled his fur seemed to run all ways
as a matter of fact we did talk on bilphism
seems her mother's a bilphist
mostly though we talked about legs
anthony rocked in glee
my god
whose legs
hers
she talked a lot about hers
as though they were a sort of choice bricbrac
she aroused a great desire to see them
what is shea dancer
no i found she was a cousin of dick's
anthony sat upright so suddenly that the pillow he released stood on end like a live thing and dove to the floor
name's gloria gilbert
he cried
yes
isn't she remarkable
i'm sure i don't knowbut for sheer dulness her father  well interrupted maury with implacable conviction her family may be as sad as professional mourners but i'm inclined to think that she's a quite authentic and original character
the outer signs of the cutanddried yale prom girl and all thatbut different very emphatically different
go on go on
urged anthony
soon as dick told me she didn't have a brain in her head i knew she must be pretty good
did he say that
swore to it said anthony with another snorting laugh
well what he means by brains in a woman is  i know interrupted anthony eagerly he means a smattering of literary misinformation
that's it
the kind who believes that the annual moral letdown of the country is a very good thing or the kind who believes it's a very ominous thing
either pincenez or postures
well this girl talked about legs
she talked about skin tooher own skin
always her own
she told me the sort of tan she'd like to get in the summer and how closely she usually approximated it
you sat enraptured by her low alto
by her low alto
no by tan
i began thinking about tan
i began to think what color i turned when i made my last exposure about two years ago
i did use to get a pretty good tan
i used to get a sort of bronze if i remember rightly
anthony retired into the cushions shaken with laughter
she's got you goingoh maury
maury the connecticut lifesaver
the human nutmeg
extra
heiress elopes with coastguard because of his luscious pigmentation
afterward found to be tasmanian strain in his family
maury sighed rising he walked to the window and raised the shade
snowing hard
anthony still laughing quietly to himself made no answer
another winter
maury's voice from the window was almost a whisper
we're growing old anthony
i'm twentyseven by god
three years to thirty and then i'm what an undergraduate calls a middleaged man
anthony was silent for a moment
you are old maury he agreed at length
the first signs of a very dissolute and wabbly senescenceyou have spent the afternoon talking about tan and a lady's legs
maury pulled down the shade with a sudden harsh snap
idiot
he cried that from you
here i sit young anthony as i'll sit for a generation or more and watch such gay souls as you and dick and gloria gilbert go past me dancing and singing and loving and hating one another and being moved being eternally moved
and i am moved only by my lack of emotion
i shall sit and the snow will comeoh for a caramel to take notesand another winter and i shall be thirty and you and dick and gloria will go on being eternally moved and dancing by me and singing
but after you've all gone i'll be saying things for new dicks to write down and listening to the disillusions and cynicisms and emotions of new anthonysyes and talking to new glorias about the tans of summers yet to come
the firelight flurried up on the hearth
maury left the window stirred the blaze with a poker and dropped a log upon the andirons
then he sat back in his chair and the remnants of his voice faded in the new fire that spit red and yellow along the bark
after all anthony it's you who are very romantic and young
it's you who are infinitely more susceptible and afraid of your calm being broken
it's me who tries again and again to be movedlet myself go a thousand times and i'm always me
nothingquitestirs me
yet he murmured after another long pause there was something about that little girl with her absurd tan that was eternally oldlike me
turbulence  anthony turned over sleepily in his bed greeting a patch of cold sun on his counterpane crisscrossed with the shadows of the leaded window
the room was full of morning
the carved chest in the corner the ancient and inscrutable wardrobe stood about the room like dark symbols of the obliviousness of matter only the rug was beckoning and perishable to his perishable feet and bounds horribly inappropriate in his soft collar was of stuff as fading as the gauze of frozen breath he uttered
he was close to the bed his hand still lowered where he had been jerking at the upper blanket his darkbrown eyes fixed imperturbably upon his master
bows
muttered the drowsy god
thachew bows
it's i sir
anthony moved his head forced his eyes wide and blinked triumphantly
bounds
yes sir
can you get offyeowowohohoh god anthony yawned insufferably and the contents of his brain seemed to fall together in a dense hash
he made a fresh start
can you come around about four and serve some tea and sandwiches or something
yes sir
anthony considered with chilling lack of inspiration
some sandwiches he repeated helplessly oh some cheese sandwiches and jelly ones and chicken and olive i guess
never mind breakfast
the strain of invention was too much
he shut his eyes wearily let his head roll to rest inertly and quickly relaxed what he had regained of muscular control
out of a crevice of his mind crept the vague but inevitable spectre of the night beforebut it proved in this case to be nothing but a seemingly interminable conversation with richard caramel who had called on him at midnight they had drunk four bottles of beer and munched dry crusts of bread while anthony listened to a reading of the first part of the demon lover
came a voice now after many hours
anthony disregarded it as sleep closed over him folded down upon him crept up into the byways of his mind
suddenly he was awake saying what
for how many sir
it was still bounds standing patient and motionless at the foot of the bedbounds who divided his manner among three gentlemen
how many what
i think sir i'd better know how many are coming
i'll have to plan for the sandwiches sir
two muttered anthony huskily lady and a gentleman
bounds said thank you sir and moved away bearing with him his humiliating reproachful soft collar reproachful to each of the three gentlemen who only demanded of him a third
after a long time anthony arose and drew an opalescent dressing grown of brown and blue over his slim pleasant figure
with a last yawn he went into the bathroom and turning on the dresser light the bathroom had no outside exposure he contemplated himself in the mirror with some interest
a wretched apparition he thought he usually thought so in the morningsleep made his face unnaturally pale
he lit a cigarette and glanced through several letters and the morning tribune
an hour later shaven and dressed he was sitting at his desk looking at a small piece of paper he had taken out of his wallet
it was scrawled with semilegible memoranda see mr howland at five
get haircut
see about rivers' bill
go bookstore
and under the last cash in bank  crossed out  crossed out 
finally down at the bottom and in a hurried scrawl dick and gloria gilbert for tea
this last item brought him obvious satisfaction
his day usually a jellylike creature a shapeless spineless thing had attained mesozoic structure
it was marching along surely even jauntily toward a climax as a play should as a day should
he dreaded the moment when the backbone of the day should be broken when he should have met the girl at last talked to her and then bowed her laughter out the door returning only to the melancholy dregs in the teacups and the gathering staleness of the uneaten sandwiches
there was a growing lack of color in anthony's days
he felt it constantly and sometimes traced it to a talk he had had with maury noble a month before
that anything so ingenuous so priggish as a sense of waste should oppress him was absurd but there was no denying the fact that some unwelcome survival of a fetish had drawn him three weeks before down to the public library where by the token of richard caramel's card he had drawn out half a dozen books on the italian renaissance
that these books were still piled on his desk in the original order of carriage that they were daily increasing his liabilities by twelve cents was no mitigation of their testimony
they were cloth and morocco witnesses to the fact of his defection
anthony had had several hours of acute and startling panic
in justification of his manner of living there was first of course the meaninglessness of life
as aides and ministers pages and squires butlers and lackeys to this great khan there were a thousand books glowing on his shelves there was his apartment and all the money that was to be his when the old man up the river should choke on his last morality
from a world fraught with the menace of dbutantes and the stupidity of many geraldines he was thankfully deliveredrather should he emulate the feline immobility of maury and wear proudly the culminative wisdom of the numbered generations
over and against these things was something which his brain persistently analyzed and dealt with as a tiresome complex but which though logically disposed of and bravely trampled under foot had sent him out through the soft slush of late november to a library which had none of the books he most wanted
it is fair to analyze anthony as far as he could analyze himself further than that it is of course presumption
he found in himself a growing horror and loneliness
the idea of eating alone frightened him in preference he dined often with men he detested
travel which had once charmed him seemed at length unendurable a business of color without substance a phantom chase after his own dream's shadow
if i am essentially weak he thought i need work to do work to do
it worried him to think that he was after all a facile mediocrity with neither the poise of maury nor the enthusiasm of dick
it seemed a tragedy to want nothingand yet he wanted something something
he knew in flashes what it wassome path of hope to lead him toward what he thought was an imminent and ominous old age
after cocktails and luncheon at the university club anthony felt better
he had run into two men from his class at harvard and in contrast to the gray heaviness of their conversation his life assumed color
both of them were married one spent his coffee time in sketching an extranuptial adventure to the bland and appreciative smiles of the other
both of them he thought were mr gilberts in embryo the number of their yes's would have to be quadrupled their natures crabbed by twenty yearsthen they would be no more than obsolete and broken machines pseudowise and valueless nursed to an utter senility by the women they had broken
ah he was more than that as he paced the long carpet in the lounge after dinner pausing at the window to look into the harried street
he was anthony patch brilliant magnetic the heir of many years and many men
this was his world nowand that last strong irony he craved lay in the offing
with a stray boyishness he saw himself a power upon the earth with his grandfather's money he might build his own pedestal and be a talleyrand a lord verulam
the clarity of his mind its sophistication its versatile intelligence all at their maturity and dominated by some purpose yet to be born would find him work to do
on this minor his dream fadedwork to do he tried to imagine himself in congress rooting around in the litter of that incredible pigsty with the narrow and porcine brows he saw pictured sometimes in the rotogravure sections of the sunday newspapers those glorified proletarians babbling blandly to the nation the ideas of high school seniors
little men with copybook ambitions who by mediocrity had thought to emerge from mediocrity into the lustreless and unromantic heaven of a government by the peopleand the best the dozen shrewd men at the top egotistic and cynical were content to lead this choir of white ties and wire collarbuttons in a discordant and amazing hymn compounded of a vague confusion between wealth as a reward of virtue and wealth as a proof of vice and continued cheers for god the constitution and the rocky mountains
lord verulam
talleyrand
back in his apartment the grayness returned
his cocktails had died making him sleepy somewhat befogged and inclined to be surly
lord verulamhe
the very thought was bitter
anthony patch with no record of achievement without courage without strength to be satisfied with truth when it was given him
oh he was a pretentious fool making careers out of cocktails and meanwhile regretting weakly and secretly the collapse of an insufficient and wretched idealism
he had garnished his soul in the subtlest taste and now he longed for the old rubbish
he was empty it seemed empty as an old bottle  the buzzer rang at the door
anthony sprang up and lifted the tube to his ear
it was richard caramel's voice stilted and facetious  announcing miss gloria gilbert
how do you do
he said smiling and holding the door ajar
dick bowed
gloria this is anthony
well
she cried holding out a little gloved hand
under her fur coat her dress was aliceblue with white lace crinkled stiffly about her throat
let me take your things
anthony stretched out his arms and the brown mass of fur tumbled into them
thanks
what do you think of her anthony
richard caramel demanded barbarously
isn't she beautiful
well
cried the girl defiantlywithal unmoved
she was dazzlingalight it was agony to comprehend her beauty in a glance
her hair full of a heavenly glamour was gay against the winter color of the room
anthony moved about magicianlike turning the mushroom lamp into an orange glory
the stirred fire burnished the copper andirons on the hearth  i'm a solid block of ice murmured gloria casually glancing around with eyes whose irises were of the most delicate and transparent bluish white
what a slick fire
we found a place where you could stand on an ironbar grating sort of and it blew warm air up at youbut dick wouldn't wait there with me
i told him to go on alone and let me be happy
conventional enough this
she seemed talking for her own pleasure without effort
anthony sitting at one end of the sofa examined her profile against the foreground of the lamp the exquisite regularity of nose and upper lip the chin faintly decided balanced beautifully on a rather short neck
on a photograph she must have been completely classical almost coldbut the glow of her hair and cheeks at once flushed and fragile made her the most living person he had ever seen

think you've got the best name i've heard she was saying still apparently to herself her glance rested on him a moment and then flitted past himto the italian bracketlamps clinging like luminous yellow turtles at intervals along the walls to the books row upon row then to her cousin on the other side
anthony patch
only you ought to look sort of like a horse with a long narrow faceand you ought to be in tatters
that's all the patch part though
how should anthony look
you look like anthony she assured him seriouslyhe thought she had scarcely seen himrather majestic she continued and solemn
anthony indulged in a disconcerted smile
only i like alliterative names she went on all except mine
mine's too flamboyant
i used to know two girls named jinks though and just think if they'd been named anything except what they were namedjudy jinks and jerry jinks
cute what
don't you think
her childish mouth was parted awaiting a rejoinder
everybody in the next generation suggested dick will be named peter or barbarabecause at present all the piquant literary characters are named peter or barbara
anthony continued the prophecy  of course gladys and eleanor having graced the last generation of heroines and being at present in their social prime will be passed on to the next generation of shopgirls  displacing ella and stella interrupted dick
and pearl and jewel gloria added cordially and earl and elmer and minnie
and then i'll come along remarked dick and picking up the obsolete name jewel i'll attach it to some quaint and attractive character and it'll start its career all over again
her voice took up the thread of subject and wove along with faintly upturning halfhumorous intonations for sentence endsas though defying interruptionand intervals of shadowy laughter
dick had told her that anthony's man was named boundsshe thought that was wonderful
dick had made some sad pun about bounds doing patchwork but if there was one thing worse than a pun she said it was a person who as the inevitable comeback to a pun gave the perpetrator a mockreproachful look
where are you from
inquired anthony
he knew but beauty had rendered him thoughtless
kansas city missouri
they put her out the same time they barred cigarettes
did they bar cigarettes
i see the hand of my holy grandfather
he's a reformer or something isn't he
i blush for him
so do i she confessed
i detest reformers especially the sort who try to reform me
are there many of those
dozens
it's 'oh gloria if you smoke so many cigarettes you'll lose your pretty complexion'
and 'oh gloria why don't you marry and settle down'
anthony agreed emphatically while he wondered who had had the temerity to speak thus to such a personage
and then she continued there are all the subtle reformers who tell you the wild stories they've heard about you and how they've been sticking up for you
he saw at length that her eyes were gray very level and cool and when they rested on him he understood what maury had meant by saying she was very young and very old
she talked always about herself as a very charming child might talk and her comments on her tastes and distastes were unaffected and spontaneous
i must confess said anthony gravely that even i've heard one thing about you
alert at once she sat up straight
those eyes with the grayness and eternity of a cliff of soft granite caught his
tell me
i'll believe it
i always believe anything any one tells me about myselfdon't you
invariably
agreed the two men in unison
well tell me
i'm not sure that i ought to teased anthony smiling unwillingly
she was so obviously interested in a state of almost laughable selfabsorption
he means your nickname said her cousin
what name
inquired anthony politely puzzled
instantly she was shythen she laughed rolled back against the cushions and turned her eyes up as she spoke  coasttocoast gloria
her voice was full of laughter laughter undefined as the varying shadows playing between fire and lamp upon her hair
o lord
still anthony was puzzled
what do you mean
me i mean
that's what some silly boys coined for me
don't you see anthony explained dick traveller of a nationwide notoriety and all that
isn't that what you've heard
she's been called that for yearssince she was seventeen
anthony's eyes became sad and humorous
who's this female methuselah you've brought in here caramel
she disregarded this possibly rather resented it for she switched back to the main topic
what have you heard of me
something about your physique
oh she said coolly disappointed that all
your tan
my tan
she was puzzled
her hand rose to her throat rested there an instant as though the fingers were feeling variants of color
do you remember maury noble
man you met about a month ago
you made a great impression
she thought a moment
i rememberbut he didn't call me up
he was afraid to i don't doubt
it was black dark without now and anthony wondered that his apartment had ever seemed grayso warm and friendly were the books and pictures on the walls and the good bounds offering tea from a respectful shadow and the three nice people giving out waves of interest and laughter back and forth across the happy fire
dissatisfaction  on thursday afternoon gloria and anthony had tea together in the grill room at the plaza
her furtrimmed suit was graybecause with gray you have to wear a lot of paint she explainedand a small toque sat rakishly on her head allowing yellow ripples of hair to wave out in jaunty glory
in the higher light it seemed to anthony that her personality was infinitely softershe seemed so young scarcely eighteen her form under the tight sheath known then as a hobbleskirt was amazingly supple and slender and her hands neither artistic nor stubby were small as a child's hands should be
as they entered the orchestra were sounding the preliminary whimpers to a maxixe a tune full of castanets and facile faintly languorous violin harmonies appropriate to the crowded winter grill teeming with an excited college crowd highspirited at the approach of the holidays
carefully gloria considered several locations and rather to anthony's annoyance paraded him circuitously to a table for two at the far side of the room
reaching it she again considered
would she sit on the right or on the left
her beautiful eyes and lips were very grave as she made her choice and anthony thought again how nave was her every gesture she took all the things of life for hers to choose from and apportion as though she were continually picking out presents for herself from an inexhaustible counter
abstractedly she watched the dancers for a few moments commenting murmurously as a couple eddied near
there's a pretty girl in blueand as anthony looked obediently there
no
behind youthere
yes he agreed helplessly
you didn't see her
i'd rather look at you
i know but she was pretty
except that she had big ankles
was shei mean did she
he said indifferently
a girl's salutation came from a couple dancing close to them
hello gloria
o gloria
hello there
who's that
he demanded
i don't know
somebody
she caught sight of another face
hello muriel
then to anthony there's muriel kane
now i think she's attractive 'cept not very
anthony chuckled appreciatively
attractive 'cept not very he repeated
she smiledwas interested immediately
why is that funny
her tone was pathetically intent
it just was
do you want to dance
do you
sort of
but let's sit she decided
and talk about you
you love to talk about you don't you
yes
caught in a vanity she laughed
i imagine your autobiography would be a classic
dick says i haven't got one
dick
he exclaimed
what does he know about you
nothing
but he says the biography of every woman begins with the first kiss that counts and ends when her last child is laid in her arms
he's talking from his book
he says unloved women have no biographiesthey have histories
anthony laughed again
surely you don't claim to be unloved
well i suppose not
then why haven't you a biography
haven't you ever had a kiss that counted
as the words left his lips he drew in his breath sharply as though to suck them back
this baby
i don't know what you mean 'counts' she objected
i wish you'd tell me how old you are
twentytwo she said meeting his eyes gravely
how old did you think
about eighteen
i'm going to start being that
i don't like being twentytwo
i hate it more than anything in the world
being twentytwo
no
getting old and everything
getting married
don't you ever want to marry
i don't want to have responsibility and a lot of children to take care of
evidently she did not doubt that on her lips all things were good
he waited rather breathlessly for her next remark expecting it to follow up her last
she was smiling without amusement but pleasantly and after an interval half a dozen words fell into the space between them  i wish i had some gumdrops
you shall
he beckoned to a waiter and sent him to the cigar counter
d'you mind
i love gumdrops
everybody kids me about it because i'm always whacking away at onewhenever my daddy's not around
not at allwho are all these children
he asked suddenly
do you know them all
whyno but they're fromoh from everywhere i suppose
don't you ever come here
very seldom
i don't care particularly for 'nice girls'
immediately he had her attention
she turned a definite shoulder to the dancers relaxed in her chair and demanded  what do you do with yourself
thanks to a cocktail anthony welcomed the question
in a mood to talk he wanted moreover to impress this girl whose interest seemed so tantalizingly elusiveshe stopped to browse in unexpected pastures hurried quickly over the inobviously obvious
he wanted to pose
he wanted to appear suddenly to her in novel and heroic colors
he wanted to stir her from that casualness she showed toward everything except herself
i do nothing he began realizing simultaneously that his words were to lack the debonair grace he craved for them
i do nothing for there's nothing i can do that's worth doing
well
he had neither surprised her nor even held her yet she had certainly understood him if indeed he had said aught worth understanding
don't you approve of lazy men
she nodded
i suppose so if they're gracefully lazy
is that possible for an american
why not
he demanded discomfited
but her mind had left the subject and wandered up ten floors
my daddy's mad at me she observed dispassionately
why
but i want to know just why it's impossible for an american to be gracefully idlehis words gathered convictionit astonishes me
ititi don't understand why people think that every young man ought to go downtown and work ten hours a day for the best twenty years of his life at dull unimaginative work certainly not altruistic work
he broke off
she watched him inscrutably
he waited for her to agree or disagree but she did neither
don't you ever form judgments on things
he asked with some exasperation
she shook her head and her eyes wandered back to the dancers as she answered  i don't know
i don't know anything aboutwhat you should do or what anybody should do
she confused him and hindered the flow of his ideas
selfexpression had never seemed at once so desirable and so impossible
well he admitted apologetically neither do i of course but  i just think of people she continued whether they seem right where they are and fit into the picture
i don't mind if they don't do anything
i don't see why they should in fact it always astonishes me when anybody does anything
you don't want to do anything
i want to sleep
for a second he was startled almost as though she had meant this literally
sleep
sort of
i want to just be lazy and i want some of the people around me to be doing things because that makes me feel comfortable and safeand i want some of them to be doing nothing at all because they can be graceful and companionable for me
but i never want to change people or get excited over them
you're a quaint little determinist laughed anthony
it's your world isn't it
well she said with a quick upward glance isn't it
as long as i'myoung
she had paused slightly before the last word and anthony suspected that she had started to say beautiful
it was undeniably what she had intended
her eyes brightened and he waited for her to enlarge on the theme
he had drawn her out at any ratehe bent forward slightly to catch the words
but let's dance
was all she said
admiration  that winter afternoon at the plaza was the first of a succession of dates anthony made with her in the blurred and stimulating days before christmas
invariably she was busy
what particular strata of the city's social life claimed her he was a long time finding out
it seemed to matter very little
she attended the semipublic charity dances at the big hotels he saw her several times at dinner parties in sherry's and once as he waited for her to dress mrs gilbert apropos of her daughter's habit of going rattled off an amazing holiday programme that included half a dozen dances to which anthony had received cards
he made engagements with her several times for lunch and teathe former were hurried and to him at least rather unsatisfactory occasions for she was sleepyeyed and casual incapable of concentrating upon anything or of giving consecutive attention to his remarks
when after two of these sallow meals he accused her of tendering him the skin and bones of the day she laughed and gave him a teatime three days off
this was infinitely more satisfactory
one sunday afternoon just before christmas he called up and found her in the lull directly after some important but mysterious quarrel she informed him in a tone of mingled wrath and amusement that she had sent a man out of her apartmenthere anthony speculated violentlyand that the man had been giving a little dinner for her that very night and that of course she wasn't going
so anthony took her to supper
let's go to something
she proposed as they went down in the elevator
i want to see a show don't you
inquiry at the hotel ticket desk disclosed only two sunday night concerts
they're always the same she complained unhappily same old yiddish comedians
oh let's go somewhere
to conceal a guilty suspicion that he should have arranged a performance of some kind for her approval anthony affected a knowing cheerfulness
we'll go to a good cabaret
i've seen every one in town
well we'll find a new one
she was in wretched humor that was evident
her gray eyes were granite now indeed
when she wasn't speaking she stared straight in front of her as if at some distasteful abstraction in the lobby
well come on then
he followed her a graceful girl even in her enveloping fur out to a taxicab and with an air of having a definite place in mind instructed the driver to go over to broadway and then turn south
he made several casual attempts at conversation but as she adopted an impenetrable armor of silence and answered him in sentences as morose as the cold darkness of the taxicab he gave up and assuming a like mood fell into a dim gloom
a dozen blocks down broadway anthony's eyes were caught by a large and unfamiliar electric sign spelling marathon in glorious yellow script adorned with electrical leaves and flowers that alternately vanished and beamed upon the wet and glistening street
he leaned and rapped on the taxiwindow and in a moment was receiving information from a colored doorman yes this was a cabaret
fine cabaret
bes' showina city
shall we try it
with a sigh gloria tossed her cigarette out the open door and prepared to follow it then they had passed under the screaming sign under the wide portal and up by a stuffy elevator into this unsung palace of pleasure
the gay habitats of the very rich and the very poor the very dashing and the very criminal not to mention the lately exploited very bohemian are made known to the awed high school girls of augusta georgia and redwing minnesota not only through the bepictured and entrancing spreads of the sunday theatrical supplements but through the shocked and alarmful eyes of mr rupert hughes and other chroniclers of the mad pace of america
but the excursions of harlem onto broadway the deviltries of the dull and the revelries of the respectable are a matter of esoteric knowledge only to the participants themselves
a tip circulatesand in the place knowingly mentioned gather the lower moralclasses on saturday and sunday nightsthe little troubled men who are pictured in the comics as the consumer or the public
they have made sure that the place has three qualifications it is cheap it imitates with a sort of shoddy and mechanical wistfulness the glittering antics of the great cafes in the theatre district andthis above all importantit is a place where they can take a nice girl which means of course that every one has become equally harmless timid and uninteresting through lack of money and imagination
there on sunday nights gather the credulous sentimental underpaid overworked people with hyphenated occupations bookkeepers ticketsellers officemanagers salesmen and most of all clerksclerks of the express of the mail of the grocery of the brokerage of the bank
with them are their giggling overgestured pathetically pretentious women who grow fat with them bear them too many babies and float helpless and uncontent in a colorless sea of drudgery and broken hopes
they name these brummagem cabarets after pullman cars
the marathon
not for them the salacious similes borrowed from the cafs of paris
this is where their docile patrons bring their nice women whose starved fancies are only too willing to believe that the scene is comparatively gay and joyous and even faintly immoral
this is life
who cares for the morrow
abandoned people
anthony and gloria seated looked about them
at the next table a party of four were in process of being joined by a party of three two men and a girl who were evidently lateand the manner of the girl was a study in national sociology
she was meeting some new menand she was pretending desperately
by gesture she was pretending and by words and by the scarcely perceptible motionings of her eyelids that she belonged to a class a little superior to the class with which she now had to do that a while ago she had been and presently would again be in a higher rarer air
she was almost painfully refinedshe wore a last year's hat covered with violets no more yearningly pretentious and palpably artificial than herself
fascinated anthony and gloria watched the girl sit down and radiate the impression that she was only condescendingly present
for me her eyes said this is practically a slumming expedition to be cloaked with belittling laughter and semiapologetics
and the other women passionately poured out the impression that though they were in the crowd they were not of it
this was not the sort of place to which they were accustomed they had dropped in because it was near by and convenientevery party in the restaurant poured out that impression  who knew
they were forever changing class all of themthe women often marrying above their opportunities the men striking suddenly a magnificent opulence a sufficiently preposterous advertising scheme a celestialized ice cream cone
meanwhile they met here to eat closing their eyes to the economy displayed in infrequent changings of tablecloths in the casualness of the cabaret performers most of all in the colloquial carelessness and familiarity of the waiters
one was sure that these waiters were not impressed by their patrons
one expected that presently they would sit at the tables   do you object to this
inquired anthony
gloria's face warmed and for the first time that evening she smiled
i love it she said frankly
it was impossible to doubt her
her gray eyes roved here and there drowsing idle or alert on each group passing to the next with unconcealed enjoyment and to anthony were made plain the different values of her profile the wonderfully alive expressions of her mouth and the authentic distinction of face and form and manner that made her like a single flower amidst a collection of cheap bricbrac
at her happiness a gorgeous sentiment welled into his eyes choked him up set his nerves atingle and filled his throat with husky and vibrant emotion
there was a hush upon the room
the careless violins and saxophones the shrill rasping complaint of a child near by the voice of the violethatted girl at the next table all moved slowly out receded and fell away like shadowy reflections on the shining floorand they two it seemed to him were alone and infinitely remote quiet
surely the freshness of her cheeks was a gossamer projection from a land of delicate and undiscovered shades her hand gleaming on the stained tablecloth was a shell from some far and wildly virginal sea  then the illusion snapped like a nest of threads the room grouped itself around him voices faces movement the garish shimmer of the lights overhead became real became portentous breath began the slow respiration that she and he took in time with this docile hundred the rise and fall of bosoms the eternal meaningless play and interplay and tossing and reiterating of word and phraseall these wrenched his senses open to the suffocating pressure of lifeand then her voice came at him cool as the suspended dream he had left behind
i belong here she murmured i'm like these people
for an instant this seemed a sardonic and unnecessary paradox hurled at him across the impassable distances she created about herself
her entrancement had increasedher eyes rested upon a semitic violinist who swayed his shoulders to the rhythm of the year's mellowest foxtrot  somethinggoes ringatingalingaling right inyour ear  again she spoke from the centre of this pervasive illusion of her own
it amazed him
it was like blasphemy from the mouth of a child
i'm like they arelike japanese lanterns and crape paper and the music of that orchestra
you're a young idiot
he insisted wildly
she shook her blond head
no i'm not
i am like them you ought to see you don't know me
she hesitated and her eyes came back to him rested abruptly on his as though surprised at the last to see him there
i've got a streak of what you'd call cheapness
i don't know where i get it but it'soh things like this and bright colors and gaudy vulgarity
i seem to belong here
these people could appreciate me and take me for granted and these men would fall in love with me and admire me whereas the clever men i meet would just analyze me and tell me i'm this because of this or that because of that
anthony for the moment wanted fiercely to paint her to set her down now as she was as as with each relentless second she could never be again
what were you thinking
she asked
just that i'm not a realist he said and then no only the romanticist preserves the things worth preserving
out of the deep sophistication of anthony an understanding formed nothing atavistic or obscure indeed scarcely physical at all an understanding remembered from the romancings of many generations of minds that as she talked and caught his eyes and turned her lovely head she moved him as he had never been moved before
the sheath that held her soul had assumed significancethat was all
she was a sun radiant growing gathering light and storing itthen after an eternity pouring it forth in a glance the fragment of a sentence to that part of him that cherished all beauty and all illusion
chapter iii   the connoisseur of kisses  from his undergraduate days as editor of the harvard crimson richard caramel had desired to write
but as a senior he had picked up the glorified illusion that certain men were set aside for service and going into the world were to accomplish a vague yearnful something which would react either in eternal reward or at the least in the personal satisfaction of having striven for the greatest good of the greatest number
this spirit has long rocked the colleges in america
it begins as a rule during the immaturities and facile impressions of freshman yearsometimes back in preparatory school
prosperous apostles known for their emotional acting go the rounds of the universities and by frightening the amiable sheep and dulling the quickening of interest and intellectual curiosity which is the purpose of all education distil a mysterious conviction of sin harking back to childhood crimes and to the everpresent menace of women
to these lectures go the wicked youths to cheer and joke and the timid to swallow the tasty pills which would be harmless if administered to farmers' wives and pious drugclerks but are rather dangerous medicine for these future leaders of men
this octopus was strong enough to wind a sinuous tentacle about richard caramel
the year after his graduation it called him into the slums of new york to muck about with bewildered italians as secretary to an alien young men's rescue association
he labored at it over a year before the monotony began to weary him
the aliens kept coming inexhaustiblyitalians poles scandinavians czechs armenianswith the same wrongs the same exceptionally ugly faces and very much the same smells though he fancied that these grew more profuse and diverse as the months passed
his eventual conclusions about the expediency of service were vague but concerning his own relation to it they were abrupt and decisive
any amiable young man his head ringing with the latest crusade could accomplish as much as he could with the dbris of europeand it was time for him to write
he had been living in a downtown ymca but when he quit the task of making sowear purses out of sows' ears he moved uptown and went to work immediately as a reporter for the sun
he kept at this for a year doing desultory writing on the side with little success and then one day an infelicitous incident peremptorily closed his newspaper career
on a february afternoon he was assigned to report a parade of squadron a
snow threatening he went to sleep instead before a hot fire and when he woke up did a smooth column about the muffled beats of the horses' hoofs in the snow
this he handed in
next morning a marked copy of the paper was sent down to the city editor with a scrawled note fire the man who wrote this
it seemed that squadron a had also seen the snow threateninghad postponed the parade until another day
a week later he had begun the demon lover
in january the monday of the months richard caramel's nose was blue constantly a sardonic blue vaguely suggestive of the flames licking around a sinner
his book was nearly ready and as it grew in completeness it seemed to grow also in its demands sapping him overpowering him until he walked haggard and conquered in its shadow
not only to anthony and maury did he pour out his hopes and boasts and indecisions but to any one who could be prevailed upon to listen
he called on polite but bewildered publishers he discussed it with his casual visvis at the harvard club it was even claimed by anthony that he had been discovered one sunday night debating the transposition of chapter two with a literary ticketcollector in the chill and dismal recesses of a harlem subway station
and latest among his confidantes was mrs gilbert who sat with him by the hour and alternated between bilphism and literature in an intense crossfire
shakespeare was a bilphist she assured him through a fixed smile
oh yes
he was a bilphist
it's been proved
at this dick would look a bit blank
if you've read 'hamlet' you can't help but see
well hehe lived in a more credulous agea more religious age
but she demanded the whole loaf  oh yes but you see bilphism isn't a religion
it's the science of all religions
she smiled defiantly at him
this was the bon mot of her belief
there was something in the arrangement of words which grasped her mind so definitely that the statement became superior to any obligation to define itself
it is not unlikely that she would have accepted any idea encased in this radiant formulawhich was perhaps not a formula it was the reductio ad absurdum of all formulas
then eventually but gorgeously would come dick's turn
you've heard of the new poetry movement
you haven't
well it's a lot of young poets that are breaking away from the old forms and doing a lot of good
well what i was going to say was that my book is going to start a new prose movement a sort of renaissance
i'm sure it will beamed mrs gilbert
i'm sure it will
i went to jenny martin last tuesday the palmist you know that every one's mad about
i told her my nephew was engaged upon a work and she said she knew i'd be glad to hear that his success would be extraordinary
but she'd never seen you or known anything about younot even your name
having made the proper noises to express his amazement at this astounding phenomenon dick waved her theme by him as though he were an arbitrary traffic policeman and so to speak beckoned forward his own traffic
i'm absorbed aunt catherine he assured her i really am
all my friends are joshing meoh i see the humor in it and i don't care
i think a person ought to be able to take joshing
but i've got a sort of conviction he concluded gloomily
you're an ancient soul i always say
maybe i am
dick had reached the stage where he no longer fought but submitted
he must be an ancient soul he fancied grotesquely so old as to be absolutely rotten
however the reiteration of the phrase still somewhat embarrassed him and sent uncomfortable shivers up his back
he changed the subject
where is my distinguished cousin gloria
she's on the go somewhere with some one
dick paused considered and then screwing up his face into what was evidently begun as a smile but ended as a terrifying frown delivered a comment
i think my friend anthony patch is in love with her
mrs gilbert started beamed half a second too late and breathed her really
in the tone of a detective playwhisper
i think so corrected dick gravely
she's the first girl i've ever seen him with so much
well of course said mrs gilbert with meticulous carelessness gloria never makes me her confidante
she's very secretive
between you and meshe bent forward cautiously obviously determined that only heaven and her nephew should share her confessionbetween you and me i'd like to see her settle down
dick arose and paced the floor earnestly a small active already rotund young man his hands thrust unnaturally into his bulging pockets
i'm not claiming i'm right mind you he assured the infinitelyofthehotel steelengraving which smirked respectably back at him
i'm saying nothing that i'd want gloria to know
but i think mad anthony is interestedtremendously so
he talks about her constantly
in any one else that'd be a bad sign
gloria is a very young soul began mrs gilbert eagerly but her nephew interrupted with a hurried sentence  gloria'd be a very young nut not to marry him
he stopped and faced her his expression a battle map of lines and dimples squeezed and strained to its ultimate show of intensitythis as if to make up by his sincerity for any indiscretion in his words
gloria's a wild one aunt catherine
she's uncontrollable
how she's done it i don't know but lately she's picked up a lot of the funniest friends
she doesn't seem to care
and the men she used to go with around new york were he paused for breath
yesyesyes interjected mrs gilbert with an anaemic attempt to hide the immense interest with which she listened
well continued richard caramel gravely there it is
i mean that the men she went with and the people she went with used to be first rate
now they aren't
mrs gilbert blinked very fasther bosom trembled inflated remained so for an instant and with the exhalation her words flowed out in a torrent
she knew she cried in a whisper oh yes mothers see these things
but what could she do
he knew gloria
he'd seen enough of gloria to know how hopeless it was to try to deal with her
gloria had been so spoiledin a rather complete and unusual way
she had been suckled until she was three for instance when she could probably have chewed sticks
perhapsone never knewit was this that had given that health and hardiness to her whole personality
and then ever since she was twelve years old she'd had boys about her so thickoh so thick one couldn't move
at sixteen she began going to dances at preparatory schools and then came the colleges and everywhere she went boys boys boys
at first oh until she was eighteen there had been so many that it never seemed one any more than the others but then she began to single them out
she knew there had been a string of affairs spread over about three years perhaps a dozen of them altogether
sometimes the men were undergraduates sometimes just out of collegethey lasted on an average of several months each with short attractions in between
once or twice they had endured longer and her mother had hoped she would be engaged but always a new one camea new one  the men
oh she made them miserable literally
there was only one who had kept any sort of dignity and he had been a mere child young carter kirby of kansas city who was so conceited anyway that he just sailed out on his vanity one afternoon and left for europe next day with his father
the others had beenwretched
they never seemed to know when she was tired of them and gloria had seldom been deliberately unkind
they would keep phoning writing letters to her trying to see her making long trips after her around the country
some of them had confided in mrs gilbert told her with tears in their eyes that they would never get over gloria  at least two of them had since married though
but gloria it seemed struck to killto this day mr carstairs called up once a week and sent her flowers which she no longer bothered to refuse
several times twice at least mrs gilbert knew it had gone as far as a private engagementwith tudor baird and that holcome boy at pasadena
she was sure it had becausethis must go no furthershe had come in unexpectedly and found gloria acting well very much engaged indeed
she had not spoken to her daughter of course
she had had a certain sense of delicacy and besides each time she had expected an announcement in a few weeks
but the announcement never came instead a new man came
scenes
young men walking up and down the library like caged tigers
young men glaring at each other in the hall as one came and the other left
young men calling up on the telephone and being hung up upon in desperation
young men threatening south america
 young men writing the most pathetic letters
she said nothing to this effect but dick fancied that mrs gilbert's eyes had seen some of these letters
 and gloria between tears and laughter sorry glad out of love and in love miserable nervous cool amidst a great returning of presents substitution of pictures in immemorial frames and taking of hot baths and beginning againwith the next
that state of things continued assumed an air of permanency
nothing harmed gloria or changed her or moved her
and then out of a clear sky one day she informed her mother that undergraduates wearied her
she was absolutely going to no more college dances
this had begun the changenot so much in her actual habits for she danced and had as many dates as everbut they were dates in a different spirit
previously it had been a sort of pride a matter of her own vainglory
she had been probably the most celebrated and soughtafter young beauty in the country
gloria gilbert of kansas city
she had fed on it ruthlesslyenjoying the crowds around her the manner in which the most desirable men singled her out enjoying the fierce jealousy of other girls enjoying the fabulous not to say scandalous and her mother was glad to say entirely unfounded rumors about herfor instance that she had gone in the yale swimmingpool one night in a chiffon evening dress
and from loving it with a vanity that was almost masculineit had been in the nature of a triumphant and dazzling careershe became suddenly anaesthetic to it
she retired
she who had dominated countless parties who had blown fragrantly through many ballrooms to the tender tribute of many eyes seemed to care no longer
he who fell in love with her now was dismissed utterly almost angrily
she went listlessly with the most indifferent men
she continually broke engagements not as in the past from a cool assurance that she was irreproachable that the man she insulted would return like a domestic animalbut indifferently without contempt or pride
she rarely stormed at men any moreshe yawned at them
she seemedand it was so strangeshe seemed to her mother to be growing cold
richard caramel listened
at first he had remained standing but as his aunt's discourse waxed in contentit stands here pruned by half of all side references to the youth of gloria's soul and to mrs gilbert's own mental distresseshe drew a chair up and attended rigorously as she floated between tears and plaintive helplessness down the long story of gloria's life
when she came to the tale of this last year a tale of the ends of cigarettes left all over new york in little trays marked midnight frolic and justine johnson's little club he began nodding his head slowly then faster and faster until as she finished on a staccato note it was bobbing briskly up and down absurdly like a doll's wired head expressingalmost anything
in a sense gloria's past was an old story to him
he had followed it with the eyes of a journalist for he was going to write a book about her some day
but his interests just at present were family interests
he wanted to know in particular who was this joseph bloeckman that he had seen her with several times and those two girls she was with constantly this rachael jerryl and this miss kanesurely miss kane wasn't exactly the sort one would associate with gloria
but the moment had passed
mrs gilbert having climbed the hill of exposition was about to glide swiftly down the skijump of collapse
her eyes were like a blue sky seen through two round red windowcasements
the flesh about her mouth was trembling
and at the moment the door opened admitting into the room gloria and the two young ladies lately mentioned
two young women  well
how do you do mrs
gilbert
miss kane and miss jerryl are presented to mr richard caramel
this is dick laughter
i've heard so much about you says miss kane between a giggle and a shout
how do you do says miss jerryl shyly
richard caramel tries to move about as if his figure were better
he is torn between his innate cordiality and the fact that he considers these girls rather commonnot at all the farmover type
gloria has disappeared into the bedroom
do sit down beams mrs gilbert who is by now quite herself
take off your things
dick is afraid she will make some remark about the age of his soul but he forgets his qualms in completing a conscientious novelist's examination of the two young women
muriel kane had originated in a rising family of east orange
she was short rather than small and hovered audaciously between plumpness and width
her hair was black and elaborately arranged
this in conjunction with her handsome rather bovine eyes and her overred lips combined to make her resemble theda bara the prominent motion picture actress
people told her constantly that she was a vampire and she believed them
she suspected hopefully that they were afraid of her and she did her utmost under all circumstances to give the impression of danger
an imaginative man could see the red flag that she constantly carried waving it wildly beseechinglyand alas to little spectacular avail
she was also tremendously timely she knew the latest songs all the latest songswhen one of them was played on the phonograph she would rise to her feet and rock her shoulders back and forth and snap her fingers and if there was no music she would accompany herself by humming
her conversation was also timely i don't care she would say i should worry and lose my figureand again i can't make my feet behave when i hear that tune
oh baby
her fingernails were too long and ornate polished to a pink and unnatural fever
her clothes were too tight too stylish too vivid her eyes too roguish her smile too coy
she was almost pitifully overemphasized from head to foot
the other girl was obviously a more subtle personality
she was an exquisitely dressed jewess with dark hair and a lovely milky pallor
she seemed shy and vague and these two qualities accentuated a rather delicate charm that floated about her
her family were episcopalians owned three smart women's shops along fifth avenue and lived in a magnificent apartment on riverside drive
it seemed to dick after a few moments that she was attempting to imitate gloriahe wondered that people invariably chose inimitable people to imitate
we had the most hectic time
muriel was exclaiming enthusiastically
there was a crazy woman behind us on the bus
she was absitively posolutely nutty
she kept talking to herself about something she'd like to do to somebody or something
i was petrified but gloria simply wouldn't get off
mrs gilbert opened her mouth properly awed
really
oh she was crazy
but we should worry she didn't hurt us
ugly
gracious
the man across from us said her face ought to be on a nightnurse in a home for the blind and we all howled naturally so the man tried to pick us up
presently gloria emerged from her bedroom and in unison every eye turned on her
the two girls receded into a shadowy background unperceived unmissed
we've been talking about you said dick quickly your mother and i
well said gloria
a pausemuriel turned to dick
you're a great writer aren't you
i'm a writer he confessed sheepishly
i always say said muriel earnestly that if i ever had time to write down all my experiences it'd make a wonderful book
rachael giggled sympathetically richard caramel's bow was almost stately
muriel continued  but i don't see how you can sit down and do it
and poetry
lordy i can't make two lines rhyme
well i should worry
richard caramel with difficulty restrained a shout of laughter
gloria was chewing an amazing gumdrop and staring moodily out the window
mrs gilbert cleared her throat and beamed
but you see she said in a sort of universal exposition you're not an ancient soullike richard
the ancient soul breathed a gasp of reliefit was out at last
then as if she had been considering it for five minutes gloria made a sudden announcement  i'm going to give a party
oh can i come
cried muriel with facetious daring
a dinner
seven people muriel and rachael and i and you dick and anthony and that man named noblei liked himand bloeckman
muriel and rachael went into soft and purring ecstasies of enthusiasm
mrs gilbert blinked and beamed
with an air of casualness dick broke in with a question  who is this fellow bloeckman gloria
scenting a faint hostility gloria turned to him
joseph bloeckman
he's the moving picture man
vicepresident of 'films par excellence'
he and father do a lot of business
oh
well will you all come
they would all come
a date was arranged within the week
dick rose adjusted hat coat and muffler and gave out a general smile
byby said muriel waving her hand gaily call me up some time
richard caramel blushed for her
deplorable end of the chevalier o'keefe  it was monday and anthony took geraldine burke to luncheon at the beaux artsafterward they went up to his apartment and he wheeled out the little rollingtable that held his supply of liquor selecting vermouth gin and absinthe for a proper stimulant
geraldine burke usher at keith's had been an amusement of several months
she demanded so little that he liked her for since a lamentable affair with a dbutante the preceding summer when he had discovered that after half a dozen kisses a proposal was expected he had been wary of girls of his own class
it was only too easy to turn a critical eye on their imperfections some physical harshness or a general lack of personal delicacybut a girl who was usher at keith's was approached with a different attitude
one could tolerate qualities in an intimate valet that would be unforgivable in a mere acquaintance on one's social level
geraldine curled up at the foot of the lounge considered him with narrow slanting eyes
you drink all the time don't you
she said suddenly
why i suppose so replied anthony in some surprise
don't you
nope
i go on parties sometimesyou know about once a week but i only take two or three drinks
you and your friends keep on drinking all the time
i should think you'd ruin your health
anthony was somewhat touched
why aren't you sweet to worry about me
well i do
i don't drink so very much he declared
last month i didn't touch a drop for three weeks
and i only get really tight about once a week
but you have something to drink every day and you're only twentyfive
haven't you any ambition
think what you'll be at forty
i sincerely trust that i won't live that long
she clicked her tongue with her teeth
you craazy
she said as he mixed another cocktailand then are you any relation to adam patch
yes he's my grandfather
really
she was obviously thrilled
absolutely
that's funny
my daddy used to work for him
he's a queer old man
is he nice
she demanded
well in private life he's seldom unnecessarily disagreeable
tell us about him
why anthony considered he's all shrunken up and he's got the remains of some gray hair that always looks as though the wind were in it
he's very moral
he's done a lot of good said geraldine with intense gravity
rot
scoffed anthony
he's a pious assa chickenbrain
her mind left the subject and flitted on
why don't you live with him
why don't i board in a methodist parsonage
you craazy
again she made a little clicking sound to express disapproval
anthony thought how moral was this little waif at hearthow completely moral she would still be after the inevitable wave came that would wash her off the sands of respectability
do you hate him
i wonder
i never liked him
you never like people who do things for you
does he hate you
my dear geraldine protested anthony frowning humorously do have another cocktail
i annoy him
if i smoke a cigarette he comes into the room sniffing
he's a prig a bore and something of a hypocrite
i probably wouldn't be telling you this if i hadn't had a few drinks but i don't suppose it matters
geraldine was persistently interested
she held her glass untasted between finger and thumb and regarded him with eyes in which there was a touch of awe
how do you mean a hypocrite
well said anthony impatiently maybe he's not
but he doesn't like the things that i like and so as far as i'm concerned he's uninteresting
hm
her curiosity seemed at length satisfied
she sank back into the sofa and sipped her cocktail
you're a funny one she commented thoughtfully
does everybody want to marry you because your grandfather is rich
they don'tbut i shouldn't blame them if they did
still you see i never intend to marry
she scorned this
you'll fall in love someday
oh you willi know
she nodded wisely
it'd be idiotic to be overconfident
that's what ruined the chevalier o'keefe
who was he
a creature of my splendid mind
he's my one creation the chevalier
craaazy
she murmured pleasantly using the clumsy rope ladder with which she bridged all gaps and climbed after her mental superiors
subconsciously she felt that it eliminated distances and brought the person whose imagination had eluded her back within range
oh no
objected anthony oh no geraldine
you mustn't play the alienist upon the chevalier
if you feel yourself unable to understand him i won't bring him in
besides i should feel a certain uneasiness because of his regrettable reputation
i guess i can understand anything that's got any sense to it answered geraldine a bit testily
in that case there are various episodes in the life of the chevalier which might prove diverting
well
it was his untimely end that caused me to think of him and made him apropos in the conversation
i hate to introduce him end foremost but it seems inevitable that the chevalier must back into your life
well what about him
did he die
he did
in this manner
he was an irishman geraldine a semifictional irishmanthe wild sort with a genteel brogue and 'reddish hair'
he was exiled from erin in the late days of chivalry and of course crossed over to france
now the chevalier o'keefe geraldine had like me one weakness
he was enormously susceptible to all sorts and conditions of women
besides being a sentimentalist he was a romantic a vain fellow a man of wild passions a little blind in one eye and almost stoneblind in the other
now a male roaming the world in this condition is as helpless as a lion without teeth and in consequence the chevalier was made utterly miserable for twenty years by a series of women who hated him used him bored him aggravated him sickened him spent his money made a fool of himin brief as the world has it loved him
this was bad geraldine and as the chevalier save for this one weakness this exceeding susceptibility was a man of penetration he decided that he would rescue himself once and for all from these drains upon him
with this purpose he went to a very famous monastery in champagne calledwell anachronistically known as st voltaire's
it was the rule at st voltaire's that no monk could descend to the ground story of the monastery so long as he lived but should exist engaged in prayer and contemplation in one of the four towers which were called after the four commandments of the monastery rule poverty chastity obedience and silence
when the day came that was to witness the chevalier's farewell to the world he was utterly happy
he gave all his greek books to his landlady and his sword he sent in a golden sheath to the king of france and all his mementos of ireland he gave to the young huguenot who sold fish in the street where he lived
then he rode out to st voltaire's slew his horse at the door and presented the carcass to the monastery cook
at five o'clock that night he felt for the first time freeforever free from sex
no woman could enter the monastery no monk could descend below the second story
so as he climbed the winding stair that led to his cell at the very top of the tower of chastity he paused for a moment by an open window which looked down fifty feet on to a road below
it was all so beautiful he thought this world that he was leaving the golden shower of sun beating down upon the long fields the spray of trees in the distance the vineyards quiet and green freshening wide miles before him
he leaned his elbows on the window casement and gazed at the winding road
now as it happened thrse a peasant girl of sixteen from a neighboring village was at that moment passing along this same road that ran in front of the monastery
five minutes before the little piece of ribbon which held up the stocking on her pretty left leg had worn through and broken
being a girl of rare modesty she had thought to wait until she arrived home before repairing it but it had bothered her to such an extent that she felt she could endure it no longer
so as she passed the tower of chastity she stopped and with a pretty gesture lifted her skirtas little as possible be it said to her creditto adjust her garter
up in the tower the newest arrival in the ancient monastery of st voltaire as though pulled forward by a gigantic and irresistible hand leaned from the window
further he leaned and further until suddenly one of the stones loosened under his weight broke from its cement with a soft powdery soundand first headlong then head over heels finally in a vast and impressive revolution tumbled the chevalier o'keefe bound for the hard earth and eternal damnation
thrse was so much upset by the occurrence that she ran all the way home and for ten years spent an hour a day in secret prayer for the soul of the monk whose neck and vows were simultaneously broken on that unfortunate sunday afternoon
and the chevalier o'keefe being suspected of suicide was not buried in consecrated ground but tumbled into a field near by where he doubtless improved the quality of the soil for many years afterward
such was the untimely end of a very brave and gallant gentleman
what do you think geraldine
but geraldine lost long before could only smile roguishly wave her first finger at him and repeat her bridgeall her explainall  crazy
she said you craaazy
his thin face was kindly she thought and his eyes quite gentle
she liked him because he was arrogant without being conceited and because unlike the men she met about the theatre he had a horror of being conspicuous
what an odd pointless story
but she had enjoyed the part about the stocking
after the fifth cocktail he kissed her and between laughter and bantering caresses and a halfstifled flare of passion they passed an hour
at fourthirty she claimed an engagement and going into the bathroom she rearranged her hair
refusing to let him order her a taxi she stood for a moment in the doorway
you will get married she was insisting you wait and see
anthony was playing with an ancient tennis ball and he bounced it carefully on the floor several times before he answered with a soupon of acidity  you're a little idiot geraldine
she smiled provokingly
oh i am am i
want to bet
that'd be silly too
oh it would would it
well i'll just bet you'll marry somebody inside of a year
anthony bounced the tennis ball very hard
this was one of his handsome days she thought a sort of intensity had displaced the melancholy in his dark eyes
geraldine he said at length in the first place i have no one i want to marry in the second place i haven't enough money to support two people in the third place i am entirely opposed to marriage for people of my type in the fourth place i have a strong distaste for even the abstract consideration of it
but geraldine only narrowed her eyes knowingly made her clicking sound and said she must be going
it was late
call me up soon she reminded him as he kissed her goodbye you haven't for three weeks you know
i will he promised fervently
he shut the door and coming back into the room stood for a moment lost in thought with the tennis ball still clasped in his hand
there was one of his lonelinesses coming one of those times when he walked the streets or sat aimless and depressed biting a pencil at his desk
it was a selfabsorption with no comfort a demand for expression with no outlet a sense of time rushing by ceaselessly and wastefullyassuaged only by that conviction that there was nothing to waste because all efforts and attainments were equally valueless
he thought with emotionaloud ejaculative for he was hurt and confused
no idea of getting married by god
of a sudden he hurled the tennis ball violently across the room where it barely missed the lamp and rebounding here and there for a moment lay still upon the floor
signlight and moonlight  for her dinner gloria had taken a table in the cascades at the biltmore and when the men met in the hall outside a little after eight that person bloeckman was the target of six masculine eyes
he was a stoutening ruddy jew of about thirtyfive with an expressive face under smooth sandy hairand no doubt in most business gatherings his personality would have been considered ingratiating
he sauntered up to the three younger men who stood in a group smoking as they waited for their hostess and introduced himself with a little too evident assurancenevertheless it is to be doubted whether he received the intended impression of faint and ironic chill there was no hint of understanding in his manner
you related to adam j
patch
he inquired of anthony emitting two slender strings of smoke from nostrils overwide
anthony admitted it with the ghost of a smile
he's a fine man pronounced bloeckman profoundly
he's a fine example of an american
yes agreed anthony he certainly is
i detest these underdone men he thought coldly
boiled looking
ought to be shoved back in the oven just one more minute would do it
bloeckman squinted at his watch
time these girls were showing up   anthony waited breathlessly it came   but then with a widening smile you know how women are
the three young men nodded bloeckman looked casually about him his eyes resting critically on the ceiling and then passing lower
his expression combined that of a middle western farmer appraising his wheat crop and that of an actor wondering whether he is observedthe public manner of all good americans
as he finished his survey he turned back quickly to the reticent trio determined to strike to their very heart and core
you college men
 harvard eh
i see the princeton boys beat you fellows in hockey
unfortunate man
he had drawn another blank
they had been three years out and heeded only the big football games
whether after the failure of this sally mr bloeckman would have perceived himself to be in a cynical atmosphere is problematical for  gloria arrived
muriel arrived
rachael arrived
after a hurried hello people
uttered by gloria and echoed by the other two the three swept by into the dressing room
a moment later muriel appeared in a state of elaborate undress and crept toward them
she was in her element her ebony hair was slicked straight back on her head her eyes were artificially darkened she reeked of insistent perfume
she was got up to the best of her ability as a siren more popularly a vampa picker up and thrower away of men an unscrupulous and fundamentally unmoved toyer with affections
something in the exhaustiveness of her attempt fascinated maury at first sighta woman with wide hips affecting a pantherlike litheness
as they waited the extra three minutes for gloria and by polite assumption for rachael he was unable to take his eyes from her
she would turn her head away lowering her eyelashes and biting her nether lip in an amazing exhibition of coyness
she would rest her hands on her hips and sway from side to side in tune to the music saying  did you ever hear such perfect ragtime
i just can't make my shoulders behave when i hear that
mr bloeckman clapped his hands gallantly
you ought to be on the stage
i'd like to be
cried muriel will you back me
i sure will
with becoming modesty muriel ceased her motions and turned to maury asking what he had seen this year
he interpreted this as referring to the dramatic world and they had a gay and exhilarating exchange of titles after this manner  muriel have you seen peg o' my heart
maury no i haven't
muriel eagerly it's wonderful
you want to see it
maury have you seen omar the tentmaker
muriel no but i hear it's wonderful
i'm very anxious to see it
have you seen fair and warmer
maury hopefully yes
muriel i don't think it's very good
it's trashy
maury faintly yes that's true
muriel but i went to within the law last night and i thought it was fine
have you seen the little cafe
this continued until they ran out of plays
dick meanwhile turned to mr bloeckman determined to extract what gold he could from this unpromising load
i hear all the new novels are sold to the moving pictures as soon as they come out
that's true
of course the main thing in a moving picture is a strong story
yes i suppose so
so many novels are all full of talk and psychology
of course those aren't as valuable to us
it's impossible to make much of that interesting on the screen
you want plots first said richard brilliantly
of course
plots first he paused shifted his gaze
his pause spread included the others with all the authority of a warning finger
gloria followed by rachael was coming out of the dressing room
among other things it developed during dinner that joseph bloeckman never danced but spent the music time watching the others with the bored tolerance of an elder among children
he was a dignified man and a proud one
born in munich he had begun his american career as a peanut vender with a travelling circus
at eighteen he was a side show ballyhoo later the manager of the side show and soon after the proprietor of a secondclass vaudeville house
just when the moving picture had passed out of the stage of a curiosity and become a promising industry he was an ambitious young man of twentysix with some money to invest nagging financial ambitions and a good working knowledge of the popular show business
that had been nine years before
the moving picture industry had borne him up with it where it threw off dozens of men with more financial ability more imagination and more practical ideasand now he sat here and contemplated the immortal gloria for whom young stuart holcome had gone from new york to pasadenawatched her and knew that presently she would cease dancing and come back to sit on his left hand
he hoped she would hurry
the oysters had been standing some minutes
meanwhile anthony who had been placed on gloria's left hand was dancing with her always in a certain fourth of the floor
this had there been stags would have been a delicate tribute to the girl meaning damn you don't cut in
it was very consciously intimate
well he began looking down at her you look mighty sweet tonight
she met his eyes over the horizontal half foot that separated them
thank youanthony
in fact you're uncomfortably beautiful he added
there was no smile this time
and you're very charming
isn't this nice
he laughed
we actually approve of each other
don't you usually
she had caught quickly at his remark as she always did at any unexplained allusion to herself however faint
he lowered his voice and when he spoke there was in it no more than a wisp of badinage
does a priest approve the pope
i don't knowbut that's probably the vaguest compliment i ever received
perhaps i can muster a few bromides
well i wouldn't have you strain yourself
look at muriel
right here next to us
he glanced over his shoulder
muriel was resting her brilliant cheek against the lapel of maury noble's dinner coat and her powdered left arm was apparently twisted around his head
one was impelled to wonder why she failed to seize the nape of his neck with her hand
her eyes turned ceilingward rolled largely back and forth her hips swayed and as she danced she kept up a constant low singing
this at first seemed to be a translation of the song into some foreign tongue but became eventually apparent as an attempt to fill out the metre of the song with the only words she knewthe words of the title  he's a ragpicker a ragpicker a ragtime picking man ragpicking picking pick pick ragpick pick pick
and so on into phrases still more strange and barbaric
when she caught the amused glances of anthony and gloria she acknowledged them only with a faint smile and a halfclosing of her eyes to indicate that the music entering into her soul had put her into an ecstatic and exceedingly seductive trance
the music ended and they returned to their table whose solitary but dignified occupant arose and tendered each of them a smile so ingratiating that it was as if he were shaking their hands and congratulating them on a brilliant performance
blockhead never will dance
i think he has a wooden leg remarked gloria to the table at large
the three young men started and the gentleman referred to winced perceptibly
this was the one rough spot in the course of bloeckman's acquaintance with gloria
she relentlessly punned on his name
first it had been blockhouse
lately the more invidious blockhead
he had requested with a strong undertone of irony that she use his first name and this she had done obediently several timesthen slipping helpless repentant but dissolved in laughter back into blockhead
it was a very sad and thoughtless thing
i'm afraid mr bloeckman thinks we're a frivolous crowd sighed muriel waving a balanced oyster in his direction
he has that air murmured rachael
anthony tried to remember whether she had said anything before
he thought not
it was her initial remark
mr bloeckman suddenly cleared his throat and said in a loud distinct voice  on the contrary
when a man speaks he's merely tradition
he has at best a few thousand years back of him
but woman why she is the miraculous mouthpiece of posterity
in the stunned pause that followed this astounding remark anthony choked suddenly on an oyster and hurried his napkin to his face
rachael and muriel raised a mild if somewhat surprised laugh in which dick and maury joined both of them red in the face and restraining uproariousness with the most apparent difficulty  
my god
thought anthony
it's a subtitle from one of his movies
the man's memorized it
gloria alone made no sound
she fixed mr bloeckman with a glance of silent reproach
well for the love of heaven
where on earth did you dig that up
bloeckman looked at her uncertainly not sure of her intention
but in a moment he recovered his poise and assumed the bland and consciously tolerant smile of an intellectual among spoiled and callow youth
the soup came up from the kitchenbut simultaneously the orchestra leader came up from the bar where he had absorbed the tone color inherent in a seidel of beer
so the soup was left to cool during the delivery of a ballad entitled everything's at home except your wife
then the champagneand the party assumed more amusing proportions
the men except richard caramel drank freely gloria and muriel sipped a glass apiece rachael jerryl took none
they sat out the waltzes but danced to everything elseall except gloria who seemed to tire after a while and preferred to sit smoking at the table her eyes now lazy now eager according to whether she listened to bloeckman or watched a pretty woman among the dancers
several times anthony wondered what bloeckman was telling her
he was chewing a cigar back and forth in his mouth and had expanded after dinner to the extent of violent gestures
ten o'clock found gloria and anthony beginning a dance
just as they were out of earshot of the table she said in a low voice  dance over by the door
i want to go down to the drugstore
obediently anthony guided her through the crowd in the designated direction in the hall she left him for a moment to reappear with a cloak over her arm
i want some gumdrops she said humorously apologetic you can't guess what for this time
it's just that i want to bite my fingernails and i will if i don't get some gumdrops
she sighed and resumed as they stepped into the empty elevator i've been biting 'em all day
a bit nervous you see
excuse the pun
it was unintentionalthe words just arranged themselves
gloria gilbert the female wag
reaching the ground floor they navely avoided the hotel candy counter descended the wide front staircase and walking through several corridors found a drugstore in the grand central station
after an intense examination of the perfume counter she made her purchase
then on some mutual unmentioned impulse they strolled arm in arm not in the direction from which they had come but out into fortythird street
the night was alive with thaw it was so nearly warm that a breeze drifting low along the sidewalk brought to anthony a vision of an unhopedfor hyacinthine spring
above in the blue oblong of sky around them in the caress of the drifting air the illusion of a new season carried relief from the stiff and breathedover atmosphere they had left and for a hushed moment the traffic sounds and the murmur of water flowing in the gutters seemed an illusive and rarefied prolongation of that music to which they had lately danced
when anthony spoke it was with surety that his words came from something breathless and desirous that the night had conceived in their two hearts
let's take a taxi and ride around a bit
he suggested without looking at her
oh gloria gloria
a cab yawned at the curb
as it moved off like a boat on a labyrinthine ocean and lost itself among the inchoate night masses of the great buildings among the now stilled now strident cries and clangings anthony put his arm around the girl drew her over to him and kissed her damp childish mouth
she was silent
she turned her face up to him pale under the wisps and patches of light that trailed in like moonshine through a foliage
her eyes were gleaming ripples in the white lake of her face the shadows of her hair bordered the brow with a persuasive unintimate dusk
no love was there surely nor the imprint of any love
her beauty was cool as this damp breeze as the moist softness of her own lips
you're such a swan in this light he whispered after a moment
there were silences as murmurous as sound
there were pauses that seemed about to shatter and were only to be snatched back to oblivion by the tightening of his arms about her and the sense that she was resting there as a caught gossamer feather drifted in out of the dark
anthony laughed noiselessly and exultantly turning his face up and away from her half in an overpowering rush of triumph half lest her sight of him should spoil the splendid immobility of her expression
such a kissit was a flower held against the face never to be described scarcely to be remembered as though her beauty were giving off emanations of itself which settled transiently and already dissolving upon his heart

the buildings fell away in melted shadows this was the park now and after a long while the great white ghost of the metropolitan museum moved majestically past echoing sonorously to the rush of the cab
why gloria
why gloria
her eyes appeared to regard him out of many thousand years all emotion she might have felt all words she might have uttered would have seemed inadequate beside the adequacy of her silence ineloquent against the eloquence of her beautyand of her body close to him slender and cool
tell him to turn around she murmured and drive pretty fast going back  up in the supper room the air was hot
the table littered with napkins and ashtrays was old and stale
it was between dances as they entered and muriel kane looked up with roguishness extraordinary
well where have you been
to call up mother answered gloria coolly
i promised her i would
did we miss a dance
then followed an incident that though slight in itself anthony had cause to reflect on many years afterward
joseph bloeckman leaning well back in his chair fixed him with a peculiar glance in which several emotions were curiously and inextricably mingled
he did not greet gloria except by rising and he immediately resumed a conversation with richard caramel about the influence of literature on the moving pictures
magic  the stark and unexpected miracle of a night fades out with the lingering death of the last stars and the premature birth of the first newsboys
the flame retreats to some remote and platonic fire the white heat has gone from the iron and the glow from the coal
along the shelves of anthony's library filling a wall amply crept a chill and insolent pencil of sunlight touching with frigid disapproval thrse of france and ann the superwoman jenny of the orient ballet and zuleika the conjurerand hoosier corathen down a shelf and into the years resting pityingly on the overinvoked shades of helen thas salome and cleopatra
anthony shaved and bathed sat in his most deeply cushioned chair and watched it until at the steady rising of the sun it lay glinting for a moment on the silk ends of the rugand went out
it was ten o'clock
the sunday times scattered about his feet proclaimed by rotogravure and editorial by social revelation and sporting sheet that the world had been tremendously engrossed during the past week in the business of moving toward some splendid if somewhat indeterminate goal
for his part anthony had been once to his grandfather's twice to his broker's and three times to his tailor'sand in the last hour of the week's last day he had kissed a very beautiful and charming girl
when he reached home his imagination had been teeming with high pitched unfamiliar dreams
there was suddenly no question on his mind no eternal problem for a solution and resolution
he had experienced an emotion that was neither mental nor physical nor merely a mixture of the two and the love of life absorbed him for the present to the exclusion of all else
he was content to let the experiment remain isolated and unique
almost impersonally he was convinced that no woman he had ever met compared in any way with gloria
she was deeply herself she was immeasurably sincereof these things he was certain
beside her the two dozen schoolgirls and debutantes young married women and waifs and strays whom he had known were so many females in the word's most contemptuous sense breeders and bearers exuding still that faintly odorous atmosphere of the cave and the nursery
so far as he could see she had neither submitted to any will of his nor caressed his vanityexcept as her pleasure in his company was a caress
indeed he had no reason for thinking she had given him aught that she did not give to others
this was as it should be
the idea of an entanglement growing out of the evening was as remote as it would have been repugnant
and she had disclaimed and buried the incident with a decisive untruth
here were two young people with fancy enough to distinguish a game from its realitywho by the very casualness with which they met and passed on would proclaim themselves unharmed
having decided this he went to the phone and called up the plaza hotel
gloria was out
her mother knew neither where she had gone nor when she would return
it was somehow at this point that the first wrongness in the case asserted itself
there was an element of callousness almost of indecency in gloria's absence from home
he suspected that by going out she had intrigued him into a disadvantage
returning she would find his name and smile
most discreetly
he should have waited a few hours in order to drive home the utter inconsequence with which he regarded the incident
what an asinine blunder
she would think he considered himself particularly favored
she would think he was reacting with the most inept intimacy to a quite trivial episode
he remembered that during the previous month his janitor to whom he had delivered a rather muddled lecture on the brotherhoove man had come up next day and on the basis of what had happened the night before seated himself in the window seat for a cordial and chatty halfhour
anthony wondered in horror if gloria would regard him as he had regarded that man
himanthony patch
horror
it never occurred to him that he was a passive thing acted upon by an influence above and beyond gloria that he was merely the sensitive plate on which the photograph was made
some gargantuan photographer had focussed the camera on gloria and snapthe poor plate could but develop confined like all things to its nature
but anthony lying upon his couch and staring at the orange lamp passed his thin fingers incessantly through his dark hair and made new symbols for the hours
she was in a shop now it seemed moving lithely among the velvets and the furs her own dress making as she walked a debonair rustle in that world of silken rustles and cool soprano laughter and scents of many slain but living flowers
the minnies and pearls and jewels and jennies would gather round her like courtiers bearing wispy frailties of georgette crepe delicate chiffon to echo her cheeks in faint pastel milky lace to rest in pale disarray against her neckdamask was used but to cover priests and divans in these days and cloth of samarand was remembered only by the romantic poets
she would go elsewhere after a while tilting her head a hundred ways under a hundred bonnets seeking in vain for mock cherries to match her lips or plumes that were graceful as her own supple body
noon would comeshe would hurry along fifth avenue a nordic ganymede her fur coat swinging fashionably with her steps her cheeks redder by a stroke of the wind's brush her breath a delightful mist upon the bracing airand the doors of the ritz would revolve the crowd would divide fifty masculine eyes would start stare as she gave back forgotten dreams to the husbands of many obese and comic women
one o'clock
with her fork she would tantalize the heart of an adoring artichoke while her escort served himself up in the thick dripping sentences of an enraptured man
four o'clock her little feet moving to melody her face distinct in the crowd her partner happy as a petted puppy and mad as the immemorial hatter thenthen night would come drifting down and perhaps another damp
the signs would spill their light into the street
who knew
no wiser than he they haply sought to recapture that picture done in cream and shadow they had seen on the hushed avenue the night before
and they might ah they might
a thousand taxis would yawn at a thousand corners and only to him was that kiss forever lost and done
in a thousand guises thas would hail a cab and turn up her face for loving
and her pallor would be virginal and lovely and her kiss chaste as the moon
he sprang excitedly to his feet
how inappropriate that she should be out
he had realized at last what he wantedto kiss her again to find rest in her great immobility
she was the end of all restlessness all malcontent
anthony dressed and went out as he should have done long before and down to richard caramel's room to hear the last revision of the last chapter of the demon lover
he did not call gloria again until six
he did not find her in until eight andoh climax of anticlimaxesshe could give him no engagement until tuesday afternoon
a broken piece of guttapercha clattered to the floor as he banged up the phone
black magic  tuesday was freezing cold
he called at a bleak two o'clock and as they shook hands he wondered confusedly whether he had ever kissed her it was almost unbelievablehe seriously doubted if she remembered it
i called you four times on sunday he told her
did you
there was surprise in her voice and interest in her expression
silently he cursed himself for having told her
he might have known her pride did not deal in such petty triumphs
even then he had not guessed at the truththat never having had to worry about men she had seldom used the wary subterfuges the playings out and haulings in that were the stock in trade of her sisterhood
when she liked a man that was trick enough
did she think she loved himthere was an ultimate and fatal thrust
her charm endlessly preserved itself
i was anxious to see you he said simply
i want to talk to youi mean really talk somewhere where we can be alone
may i
what do you mean
he swallowed a sudden lump of panic
he felt that she knew what he wanted
i mean not at a tea table he said
well all right but not today
i want to get some exercise
let's walk
it was bitter and raw
all the evil hate in the mad heart of february was wrought into the forlorn and icy wind that cut its way cruelly across central park and down along fifth avenue
it was almost impossible to talk and discomfort made him distracted so much so that he turned at sixtyfirst street to find that she was no longer beside him
he looked around
she was forty feet in the rear standing motionless her face half hidden in her fur coat collar moved either by anger or laughterhe could not determine which
he started back
don't let me interrupt your walk
she called
i'm mighty sorry he answered in confusion
did i go too fast
i'm cold she announced
i want to go home
and you walk too fast
i'm very sorry
side by side they started for the plaza
he wished he could see her face
men don't usually get so absorbed in themselves when they're with me
i'm sorry
that's very interesting
it is rather too cold to walk he said briskly to hide his annoyance
she made no answer and he wondered if she would dismiss him at the hotel entrance
she walked in without speaking however and to the elevator throwing him a single remark as she entered it  you'd better come up
he hesitated for the fraction of a moment
perhaps i'd better call some other time
just as you say
her words were murmured as an aside
the main concern of life was the adjusting of some stray wisps of hair in the elevator mirror
her cheeks were brilliant her eyes sparkledshe had never seemed so lovely so exquisitely to be desired
despising himself he found that he was walking down the tenthfloor corridor a subservient foot behind her was in the sitting room while she disappeared to shed her furs
something had gone wrongin his own eyes he had lost a shred of dignity in an unpremeditated yet significant encounter he had been completely defeated
however by the time she reappeared in the sittingroom he had explained himself to himself with sophistic satisfaction
after all he had done the strongest thing he thought
he had wanted to come up he had come
yet what happened later on that afternoon must be traced to the indignity he had experienced in the elevator the girl was worrying him intolerably so much so that when she came out he involuntarily drifted into criticism
who's this bloeckman gloria
a business friend of father's
odd sort of fellow
he doesn't like you either she said with a sudden smile
anthony laughed
i'm flattered at his notice
he evidently considers me a he broke off with is he in love with you
i don't know
the deuce you don't he insisted
of course he is
i remember the look he gave me when we got back to the table
he'd probably have had me quietly assaulted by a delegation of movie supes if you hadn't invented that phone call
he didn't mind
i told him afterward what really happened
you told him
he asked me
i don't like that very well he remonstrated
she laughed again
oh you don't
what business is it of his
none
that's why i told him
anthony in a turmoil bit savagely at his mouth
why should i lie
she demanded directly
i'm not ashamed of anything i do
it happened to interest him to know that i kissed you and i happened to be in a good humor so i satisfied his curiosity by a simple and precise 'yes'
being rather a sensible man after his fashion he dropped the subject
except to say that he hated me
oh it worries you
well if you must probe this stupendous matter to its depths he didn't say he hated you
i simply know he does
it doesn't wor  oh let's drop it
she cried spiritedly
it's a most uninteresting matter to me
with a tremendous effort anthony made his acquiescence a twist of subject and they drifted into an ancient questionandanswer game concerned with each other's pasts gradually warming as they discovered the ageold immemorial resemblances in tastes and ideas
they said things that were more revealing than they intendedbut each pretended to accept the other at face or rather word value
the growth of intimacy is like that
first one gives off his best picture the bright and finished product mended with bluff and falsehood and humor
then more details are required and one paints a second portrait and a thirdbefore long the best lines cancel outand the secret is exposed at last the planes of the pictures have intermingled and given us away and though we paint and paint we can no longer sell a picture
we must be satisfied with hoping that such fatuous accounts of ourselves as we make to our wives and children and business associates are accepted as true
it seems to me anthony was saying earnestly that the position of a man with neither necessity nor ambition is unfortunate
heaven knows it'd be pathetic of me to be sorry for myselfyet sometimes i envy dick
her silence was encouragement
it was as near as she ever came to an intentional lure  
and there used to be dignified occupations for a gentleman who had leisure things a little more constructive than filling up the landscape with smoke or juggling some one else's money
there's science of course sometimes i wish i'd taken a good foundation say at boston tech
but now by golly i'd have to sit down for two years and struggle through the fundamentals of physics and chemistry
she yawned
i've told you i don't know what anybody ought to do she said ungraciously and at her indifference his rancor was born again
aren't you interested in anything except yourself
not much
he glared his growing enjoyment in the conversation was ripped to shreds
she had been irritable and vindictive all day and it seemed to him that for this moment he hated her hard selfishness
he stared morosely at the fire
then a strange thing happened
she turned to him and smiled and as he saw her smile every rag of anger and hurt vanity dropped from himas though his very moods were but the outer ripples of her own as though emotion rose no longer in his breast unless she saw fit to pull an omnipotent controlling thread
he moved closer and taking her hand pulled her ever so gently toward him until she half lay against his shoulder
she smiled up at him as he kissed her
gloria he whispered very softly
again she had made a magic subtle and pervading as a spilt perfume irresistible and sweet
afterward neither the next day nor after many years could he remember the important things of that afternoon
had she been moved
in his arms had she spoken a littleor at all
what measure of enjoyment had she taken in his kisses
and had she at any time lost herself ever so little
oh for him there was no doubt
he had risen and paced the floor in sheer ecstasy
that such a girl should be should poise curled in a corner of the couch like a swallow newly landed from a clean swift flight watching him with inscrutable eyes
he would stop his pacing and half shy each time at first drop his arm around her and find her kiss
she was fascinating he told her
he had never met any one like her before
he besought her jauntily but earnestly to send him away he didn't want to fall in love
he wasn't coming to see her any morealready she had haunted too many of his ways
what delicious romance
his true reaction was neither fear nor sorrowonly this deep delight in being with her that colored the banality of his words and made the mawkish seem sad and the posturing seem wise
he would come backeternally
he should have known
this is all
it's been very rare to have known you very strange and wonderful
but this wouldn't doand wouldn't last
as he spoke there was in his heart that tremulousness that we take for sincerity in ourselves
afterward he remembered one reply of hers to something he had asked her
he remembered it in this formperhaps he had unconsciously arranged and polished it  a woman should be able to kiss a man beautifully and romantically without any desire to be either his wife or his mistress
as always when he was with her she seemed to grow gradually older until at the end ruminations too deep for words would be wintering in her eyes
an hour passed and the fire leaped up in little ecstasies as though its fading life was sweet
it was five now and the clock over the mantel became articulate in sound
then as if a brutish sensibility in him was reminded by those thin tinny beats that the petals were falling from the flowered afternoon anthony pulled her quickly to her feet and held her helpless without breath in a kiss that was neither a game nor a tribute
her arms fell to her side
in an instant she was free
don't
she said quietly
i don't want that
she sat down on the far side of the lounge and gazed straight before her
a frown had gathered between her eyes
anthony sank down beside her and closed his hand over hers
it was lifeless and unresponsive
why gloria
he made a motion as if to put his arm about her but she drew away
i don't want that she repeated
i'm very sorry he said a little impatiently
ii didn't know you made such fine distinctions
she did not answer
won't you kiss me gloria
i don't want to
it seemed to him she had not moved for hours
a sudden change isn't it
annoyance was growing in his voice
is it
she appeared uninterested
it was almost as though she were looking at some one else
perhaps i'd better go
no reply
he rose and regarded her angrily uncertainly
again he sat down
gloria gloria won't you kiss me
no
her lips parting for the word had just faintly stirred
again he got to his feet this time with less decision less confidence
then i'll go
silence
all righti'll go
he was aware of a certain irremediable lack of originality in his remarks
indeed he felt that the whole atmosphere had grown oppressive
he wished she would speak rail at him cry out upon him anything but this pervasive and chilling silence
he cursed himself for a weak fool his clearest desire was to move her to hurt her to see her wince
helplessly involuntarily he erred again
if you're tired of kissing me i'd better go
he saw her lips curl slightly and his last dignity left him
she spoke at length  i believe you've made that remark several times before
he looked about him immediately saw his hat and coat on a chairblundered into them during an intolerable moment
looking again at the couch he perceived that she had not turned not even moved
with a shaken immediately regretted goodby he went quickly but without dignity from the room
for over a moment gloria made no sound
her lips were still curled her glance was straight proud remote
then her eyes blurred a little and she murmured three words half aloud to the deathbound fire  goodby you ass
she said
panic  the man had had the hardest blow of his life
he knew at last what he wanted but in finding it out it seemed that he had put it forever beyond his grasp
he reached home in misery dropped into an armchair without even removing his overcoat and sat there for over an hour his mind racing the paths of fruitless and wretched selfabsorption
she had sent him away
that was the reiterated burden of his despair
instead of seizing the girl and holding her by sheer strength until she became passive to his desire instead of beating down her will by the force of his own he had walked defeated and powerless from her door with the corners of his mouth drooping and what force there might have been in his grief and rage hidden behind the manner of a whipped schoolboy
at one minute she had liked him tremendouslyah she had nearly loved him
in the next he had become a thing of indifference to her an insolent and efficiently humiliated man
he had no great selfreproachsome of course but there were other things dominant in him now far more urgent
he was not so much in love with gloria as mad for her
unless he could have her near him again kiss her hold her close and acquiescent he wanted nothing more from life
by her three minutes of utter unwavering indifference the girl had lifted herself from a high but somehow casual position in his mind to be instead his complete preoccupation
however much his wild thoughts varied between a passionate desire for her kisses and an equally passionate craving to hurt and mar her the residue of his mind craved in finer fashion to possess the triumphant soul that had shone through those three minutes
she was beautifulbut especially she was without mercy
he must own that strength that could send him away
at present no such analysis was possible to anthony
his clarity of mind all those endless resources which he thought his irony had brought him were swept aside
not only for that night but for the days and weeks that followed his books were to be but furniture and his friends only people who lived and walked in a nebulous outer world from which he was trying to escapethat world was cold and full of bleak wind and for a little while he had seen into a warm house where fires shone
about midnight he began to realize that he was hungry
he went down into fiftysecond street where it was so cold that he could scarcely see the moisture froze on his lashes and in the corners of his lips
everywhere dreariness had come down from the north settling upon the thin and cheerless street where black bundled figures blacker still against the night moved stumbling along the sidewalk through the shrieking wind sliding their feet cautiously ahead as though they were on skis
anthony turned over toward sixth avenue so absorbed in his thoughts as not to notice that several passersby had stared at him
his overcoat was wide open and the wind was biting in hard and full of merciless death
 after a while a waitress spoke to him a fat waitress with blackrimmed eyeglasses from which dangled a long black cord
order please
her voice he considered was unnecessarily loud
he looked up resentfully
you wanna order or doncha
of course he protested
well i ast you three times
this ain't no restroom
he glanced at the big clock and discovered with a start that it was after two
he was down around thirtieth street somewhere and after a moment he found and translated the  illustration s'dlihc transcribers note the illustration shows the word child's in mirror image
in a white semicircle of letters upon the glass front
the place was inhabited sparsely by three or four bleak and halffrozen nighthawks
give me some bacon and eggs and coffee please
the waitress bent upon him a last disgusted glance and looking ludicrously intellectual in her corded glasses hurried away
god
gloria's kisses had been such flowers
he remembered as though it had been years ago the low freshness of her voice the beautiful lines of her body shining through her clothes her face lilycolored under the lamps of the streetunder the lamps
misery struck at him again piling a sort of terror upon the ache and yearning
he had lost her
it was trueno denying it no softening it
but a new idea had seared his skywhat of bloeckman
what would happen now
there was a wealthy man middleaged enough to be tolerant with a beautiful wife to baby her whims and indulge her unreason to wear her as she perhaps wished to be worna bright flower in his buttonhole safe and secure from the things she feared
he felt that she had been playing with the idea of marrying bloeckman and it was well possible that this disappointment in anthony might throw her on sudden impulse into bloeckman's arms
the idea drove him childishly frantic
he wanted to kill bloeckman and make him suffer for his hideous presumption
he was saying this over and over to himself with his teeth tight shut and a perfect orgy of hate and fright in his eyes
but behind this obscene jealousy anthony was in love at last profoundly and truly in love as the word goes between man and woman
his coffee appeared at his elbow and gave off for a certain time a gradually diminishing wisp of steam
the night manager seated at his desk glanced at the motionless figure alone at the last table and then with a sigh moved down upon him just as the hour hand crossed the figure three on the big clock
wisdom  after another day the turmoil subsided and anthony began to exercise a measure of reason
he was in lovehe cried it passionately to himself
the things that a week before would have seemed insuperable obstacles his limited income his desire to be irresponsible and independent had in this forty hours become the merest chaff before the wind of his infatuation
if he did not marry her his life would be a feeble parody on his own adolescence
to be able to face people and to endure the constant reminder of gloria that all existence had become it was necessary for him to have hope
so he built hope desperately and tenaciously out of the stuff of his dream a hope flimsy enough to be sure a hope that was cracked and dissipated a dozen times a day a hope mothered by mockery but nevertheless a hope that would be brawn and sinew to his selfrespect
out of this developed a spark of wisdom a true perception of his own from out the effortless past
memory is short he thought
so very short
at the crucial point the trust president is on the stand a potential criminal needing but one push to be a jailbird scorned by the upright for leagues around
let him be acquittedand in a year all is forgotten
yes he did have some trouble once just a technicality i believe
oh memory is very short
anthony had seen gloria altogether about a dozen times say two dozen hours
supposing he left her alone for a month made no attempt to see her or speak to her and avoided every place where she might possibly be
wasn't it possible the more possible because she had never loved him that at the end of that time the rush of events would efface his personality from her conscious mind and with his personality his offense and humiliation
she would forget for there would be other men
he winced
the implication struck out at himother men
two monthsgod
better three weeks two weeks  he thought this the second evening after the catastrophe when he was undressing and at this point he threw himself down on the bed and lay there trembling very slightly and looking at the top of the canopy
two weeksthat was worse than no time at all
in two weeks he would approach her much as he would have to now without personality or confidenceremaining still the man who had gone too far and then for a period that in time was but a moment but in fact an eternity whined
no two weeks was too short a time
whatever poignancy there had been for her in that afternoon must have time to dull
he must give her a period when the incident should fade and then a new period when she should gradually begin to think of him no matter how dimly with a true perspective that would remember his pleasantness as well as his humiliation
he fixed finally on six weeks as approximately the interval best suited to his purpose and on a desk calendar he marked the days off finding that it would fall on the ninth of april
very well on that day he would phone and ask her if he might call
until thensilence
after his decision a gradual improvement was manifest
he had taken at least a step in the direction to which hope pointed and he realized that the less he brooded upon her the better he would be able to give the desired impression when they met
in another hour he fell into a deep sleep
the interval  nevertheless though as the days passed the glory of her hair dimmed perceptibly for him and in a year of separation might have departed completely the six weeks held many abominable days
he dreaded the sight of dick and maury imagining wildly that they knew allbut when the three met it was richard caramel and not anthony who was the centre of attention the demon lover had been accepted for immediate publication
anthony felt that from now on he moved apart
he no longer craved the warmth and security of maury's society which had cheered him no further back than november
only gloria could give that now and no one else ever again
so dick's success rejoiced him only casually and worried him not a little
it meant that the world was going aheadwriting and reading and publishingand living
and he wanted the world to wait motionless and breathless for six weekswhile gloria forgot
two encounters  his greatest satisfaction was in geraldine's company
he took her once to dinner and the theatre and entertained her several times in his apartment
when he was with her she absorbed him not as gloria had but quieting those erotic sensibilities in him that worried over gloria
it didn't matter how he kissed geraldine
a kiss was a kissto be enjoyed to the utmost for its short moment
to geraldine things belonged in definite pigeonholes a kiss was one thing anything further was quite another a kiss was all right the other things were bad
when half the interval was up two incidents occurred on successive days that upset his increasing calm and caused a temporary relapse
the first washe saw gloria
it was a short meeting
both bowed
both spoke yet neither heard the other
but when it was over anthony read down a column of the sun three times in succession without understanding a single sentence
one would have thought sixth avenue a safe street
having forsworn his barber at the plaza he went around the corner one morning to be shaved and while waiting his turn he took off coat and vest and with his soft collar open at the neck stood near the front of the shop
the day was an oasis in the cold desert of march and the sidewalk was cheerful with a population of strolling sunworshippers
a stout woman upholstered in velvet her flabby cheeks too much massaged swirled by with her poodle straining at its leashthe effect being given of a tug bringing in an ocean liner
just behind them a man in a striped blue suit walking sluefooted in whitespatted feet grinned at the sight and catching anthony's eye winked through the glass
anthony laughed thrown immediately into that humor in which men and women were graceless and absurd phantasms grotesquely curved and rounded in a rectangular world of their own building
they inspired the same sensations in him as did those strange and monstrous fish who inhabit the esoteric world of green in the aquarium
two more strollers caught his eye casually a man and a girlthen in a horrified instant the girl resolved herself into gloria
he stood here powerless they came nearer and gloria glancing in saw him
her eyes widened and she smiled politely
her lips moved
she was less than five feet away
how do you do
he muttered inanely
gloria happy beautiful and youngwith a man he had never seen before
it was then that the barber's chair was vacated and he read down the newspaper column three times in succession
the second incident took place the next day
going into the manhattan bar about seven he was confronted with bloeckman
as it happened the room was nearly deserted and before the mutual recognition he had stationed himself within a foot of the older man and ordered his drink so it was inevitable that they should converse
hello mr patch said bloeckman amiably enough
anthony took the proffered hand and exchanged a few aphorisms on the fluctuations of the mercury
do you come in here much
inquired bloeckman
no very seldom
he omitted to add that the plaza bar had until lately been his favorite
nice bar
one of the best bars in town
anthony nodded
bloeckman emptied his glass and picked up his cane
he was in evening dress
well i'll be hurrying on
i'm going to dinner with miss gilbert
death looked suddenly out at him from two blue eyes
had he announced himself as his visvis's prospective murderer he could not have struck a more vital blow at anthony
the younger man must have reddened visibly for his every nerve was in instant clamor
with tremendous effort he mustered a rigidoh so rigidsmile and said a conventional goodby
but that night he lay awake until after four half wild with grief and fear and abominable imaginings
weakness  and one day in the fifth week he called her up
he had been sitting in his apartment trying to read l'education sentimental and something in the book had sent his thoughts racing in the direction that set free they always took like horses racing for a home stable
with suddenly quickened breath he walked to the telephone
when he gave the number it seemed to him that his voice faltered and broke like a schoolboy's
the central must have heard the pounding of his heart
the sound of the receiver being taken up at the other end was a crack of doom and mrs gilbert's voice soft as maple syrup running into a glass container had for him a quality of horror in its single hellooah
miss gloria's not feeling well
she's lying down asleep
who shall i say called
nobody
he shouted
in a wild panic he slammed down the receiver collapsed into his armchair in the cold sweat of breathless relief
serenade  the first thing he said to her was why you've bobbed your hair
and she answered yes isn't it gorgeous
it was not fashionable then
it was to be fashionable in five or six years
at that time it was considered extremely daring
it's all sunshine outdoors he said gravely
don't you want to take a walk
she put on a light coat and a quaintly piquant napoleon hat of alice blue and they walked along the avenue and into the zoo where they properly admired the grandeur of the elephant and the collarheight of the giraffe but did not visit the monkey house because gloria said that monkeys smelt so bad
then they returned toward the plaza talking about nothing but glad for the spring singing in the air and for the warm balm that lay upon the suddenly golden city
to their right was the park while at the left a great bulk of granite and marble muttered dully a millionaire's chaotic message to whosoever would listen something about i worked and i saved and i was sharper than all adam and here i sit by golly by golly
all the newest and most beautiful designs in automobiles were out on fifth avenue and ahead of them the plaza loomed up rather unusually white and attractive
the supple indolent gloria walked a short shadow's length ahead of him pouring out lazy casual comments that floated a moment on the dazzling air before they reached his ear
oh
she cried i want to go south to hot springs
i want to get out in the air and just roll around on the new grass and forget there's ever been any winter
don't you though
i want to hear a million robins making a frightful racket
i sort of like birds
all women are birds he ventured
what kind am i
quick and eager
a swallow i think and sometimes a bird of paradise
most girls are sparrows of coursesee that row of nursemaids over there
they're sparrowsor are they magpies
and of course you've met canary girlsand robin girls
and swan girls and parrot girls
all grown women are hawks i think or owls
what am ia buzzard
she laughed and shook her head
oh no you're not a bird at all do you think
you're a russian wolfhound
anthony remembered that they were white and always looked unnaturally hungry
but then they were usually photographed with dukes and princesses so he was properly flattered
dick's a fox terrier a trick fox terrier she continued
and maury's a cat
simultaneously it occurred to him how like bloeckman was to a robust and offensive hog
but he preserved a discreet silence
later as they parted anthony asked when he might see her again
don't you ever make long engagements
he pleaded even if it's a week ahead i think it'd be fun to spend a whole day together morning and afternoon both
it would be wouldn't it
she thought for a moment
let's do it next sunday
all right
i'll map out a programme that'll take up every minute
he did
he even figured to a nicety what would happen in the two hours when she would come to his apartment for tea how the good bounds would have the windows wide to let in the fresh breezebut a fire going also lest there be chill in the airand how there would be clusters of flowers about in big cool bowls that he would buy for the occasion
they would sit on the lounge
and when the day came they did sit upon the lounge
after a while anthony kissed her because it came about quite naturally he found sweetness sleeping still upon her lips and felt that he had never been away
the fire was bright and the breeze sighing in through the curtains brought a mellow damp promising may and world of summer
his soul thrilled to remote harmonies he heard the strum of far guitars and waters lapping on a warm mediterranean shorefor he was young now as he would never be again and more triumphant than death
six o'clock stole down too soon and rang the querulous melody of st anne's chimes on the corner
through the gathering dusk they strolled to the avenue where the crowds like prisoners released were walking with elastic step at last after the long winter and the tops of the busses were thronged with congenial kings and the shops full of fine soft things for the summer the rare summer the gay promising summer that seemed for love what the winter was for money
life was singing for his supper on the corner
life was handing round cocktails in the street
old women there were in that crowd who felt that they could have run and won a hundredyard dash
in bed that night with the lights out and the cool room swimming with moonlight anthony lay awake and played with every minute of the day like a child playing in turn with each one of a pile of longwanted christmas toys
he had told her gently almost in the middle of a kiss that he loved her and she had smiled and held him closer and murmured i'm glad looking into his eyes
there had been a new quality in her attitude a new growth of sheer physical attraction toward him and a strange emotional tenseness that was enough to make him clinch his hands and draw in his breath at the recollection
he had felt nearer to her than ever before
in a rare delight he cried aloud to the room that he loved her
he phoned next morningno hesitation now no uncertaintyinstead a delirious excitement that doubled and trebled when he heard her voice  good morninggloria
good morning
that's all i called you up to saydear
i'm glad you did
i wish i could see you
you will tomorrow night
that's a long time isn't it
yes her voice was reluctant
his hand tightened on the receiver
couldn't i come tonight
he dared anything in the glory and revelation of that almost whispered yes
i have a date
oh  but i mighti might be able to break it
oh
a sheer cry a rhapsody
gloria
what
i love you
another pause and then  ii'm glad
happiness remarked maury noble one day is only the first hour after the alleviation of some especially intense misery
but oh anthony's face as he walked down the tenthfloor corridor of the plaza that night
his dark eyes were gleamingaround his mouth were lines it was a kindness to see
he was handsome then if never before bound for one of those immortal moments which come so radiantly that their remembered light is enough to see by for years
he knocked and at a word entered
gloria dressed in simple pink starched and fresh as a flower was across the room standing very still and looking at him wideeyed
as he closed the door behind him she gave a little cry and moved swiftly over the intervening space her arms rising in a premature caress as she came near
together they crushed out the stiff folds of her dress in one triumphant and enduring embrace
book two     chapter i   the radiant hour  after a fortnight anthony and gloria began to indulge in practical discussions as they called those sessions when under the guise of severe realism they walked in an eternal moonlight
not as much as i do you the critic of belleslettres would insist
if you really loved me you'd want every one to know it
i do she protested i want to stand on the street corner like a sandwich man informing all the passersby
then tell me all the reasons why you're going to marry me in june
well because you're so clean
you're sort of blowy clean like i am
there's two sorts you know
one's like dick he's clean like polished pans
you and i are clean like streams and winds
i can tell whenever i see a person whether he is clean and if so which kind of clean he is
we're twins
ecstatic thought
mother saysshe hesitated uncertainlymother says that two souls are sometimes created together andand in love before they're born
bilphism gained its easiest convert after a while he lifted up his head and laughed soundlessly toward the ceiling
when his eyes came back to her he saw that she was angry
why did you laugh
she cried you've done that twice before
there's nothing funny about our relation to each other
i don't mind playing the fool and i don't mind having you do it but i can't stand it when we're together
i'm sorry
oh don't say you're sorry
if you can't think of anything better than that just keep quiet
i love you
i don't care
there was a pause
anthony was depressed at length gloria murmured  i'm sorry i was mean
you weren't
i was the one
peace was restoredthe ensuing moments were so much more sweet and sharp and poignant
they were stars on this stage each playing to an audience of two the passion of their pretense created the actuality
here finally was the quintessence of selfexpressionyet it was probable that for the most part their love expressed gloria rather than anthony
he felt often like a scarcely tolerated guest at a party she was giving
telling mrs gilbert had been an embarrassed matter
she sat stuffed into a small chair and listened with an intense and very blinky sort of concentration
she must have known itfor three weeks gloria had seen no one elseand she must have noticed that this time there was an authentic difference in her daughter's attitude
she had been given special deliveries to post she had heeded as all mothers seem to heed the hither end of telephone conversations disguised but still rather warm  yet she had delicately professed surprise and declared herself immensely pleased she doubtless was so were the geranium plants blossoming in the windowboxes and so were the cabbies when the lovers sought the romantic privacy of hansom cabsquaint deviceand the staid bill of fares on which they scribbled you know i do pushing it over for the other to see
but between kisses anthony and this golden girl quarrelled incessantly
now gloria he would cry please let me explain
don't explain
kiss me
i don't think that's right
if i hurt your feelings we ought to discuss it
i don't like this kissandforget
but i don't want to argue
i think it's wonderful that we can kiss and forget and when we can't it'll be time to argue
at one time some gossamer difference attained such bulk that anthony arose and punched himself into his overcoatfor a moment it appeared that the scene of the preceding february was to be repeated but knowing how deeply she was moved he retained his dignity with his pride and in a moment gloria was sobbing in his arms her lovely face miserable as a frightened little girl's
meanwhile they kept unfolding to each other unwillingly by curious reactions and evasions by distastes and prejudices and unintended hints of the past
the girl was proudly incapable of jealousy and because he was extremely jealous this virtue piqued him
he told her recondite incidents of his own life on purpose to arouse some spark of it but to no avail
she possessed him nownor did she desire the dead years
oh anthony she would say always when i'm mean to you i'm sorry afterward
i'd give my right hand to save you one little moment's pain
and in that instant her eyes were brimming and she was not aware that she was voicing an illusion
yet anthony knew that there were days when they hurt each other purposelytaking almost a delight in the thrust
incessantly she puzzled him one hour so intimate and charming striving desperately toward an unguessed transcendent union the next silent and cold apparently unmoved by any consideration of their love or anything he could say
often he would eventually trace these portentous reticences to some physical discomfortof these she never complained until they were overor to some carelessness or presumption in him or to an unsatisfactory dish at dinner but even then the means by which she created the infinite distances she spread about herself were a mystery buried somewhere back in those twentytwo years of unwavering pride
why do you like muriel
he demanded one day
i don't very much
then why do you go with her
just for some one to go with
they're no exertion those girls
they sort of believe everything i tell thembut i rather like rachael
i think she's cuteand so clean and slick don't you
i used to have other friendsin kansas city and at schoolcasual all of them girls who just flitted into my range and out of it for no more reason than that boys took us places together
they didn't interest me after environment stopped throwing us together
now they're mostly married
what does it matterthey were all just people
you like men better don't you
oh much better
i've got a man's mind
you've got a mind like mine
not strongly gendered either way
later she told him about the beginnings of her friendship with bloeckman
one day in delmonico's gloria and rachael had come upon bloeckman and mr gilbert having luncheon and curiosity had impelled her to make it a party of four
she had liked himrather
he was a relief from younger men satisfied as he was with so little
he humored her and he laughed whether he understood her or not
she met him several times despite the open disapproval of her parents and within a month he had asked her to marry him tendering her everything from a villa in italy to a brilliant career on the screen
she had laughed in his faceand he had laughed too
but he had not given up
to the time of anthony's arrival in the arena he had been making steady progress
she treated him rather wellexcept that she had called him always by an invidious nicknameperceiving meanwhile that he was figuratively following along beside her as she walked the fence ready to catch her if she should fall
the night before the engagement was announced she told bloeckman
it was a heavy blow
she did not enlighten anthony as to the details but she implied that he had not hesitated to argue with her
anthony gathered that the interview had terminated on a stormy note with gloria very cool and unmoved lying in her corner of the sofa and joseph bloeckman of films par excellence pacing the carpet with eyes narrowed and head bowed
gloria had been sorry for him but she had judged it best not to show it
in a final burst of kindness she had tried to make him hate her there at the last
but anthony understanding that gloria's indifference was her strongest appeal judged how futile this must have been
he wondered often but quite casually about bloeckmanfinally he forgot him entirely
heyday  one afternoon they found front seats on the sunny roof of a bus and rode for hours from the fading square up along the sullied river and then as the stray beams fled the westward streets sailed down the turgid avenue darkening with ominous bees from the department stores
the traffic was clotted and gripped in a patternless jam the busses were packed four deep like platforms above the crowd as they waited for the moan of the traffic whistle
isn't it good
cried gloria
look
a miller's wagon stark white with flour driven by a powdery clown passed in front of them behind a white horse and his black teammate
what a pity
she complained they'd look so beautiful in the dusk if only both horses were white
i'm mighty happy just this minute in this city
anthony shook his head in disagreement
i think the city's a mountebank
always struggling to approach the tremendous and impressive urbanity ascribed to it
trying to be romantically metropolitan
i don't
i think it is impressive
momentarily
but it's really a transparent artificial sort of spectacle
it's got its pressagented stars and its flimsy unenduring stage settings and i'll admit the greatest army of supers ever assembled he paused laughed shortly and added technically excellent perhaps but not convincing
i'll bet policemen think people are fools said gloria thoughtfully as she watched a large but cowardly lady being helped across the street
he always sees them frightened and inefficient and oldthey are she added
and then we'd better get off
i told mother i'd have an early supper and go to bed
she says i look tired damn it
i wish we were married he muttered soberly there'll be no good night then and we can do just as we want
won't it be good
i think we ought to travel a lot
i want to go to the mediterranean and italy
and i'd like to go on the stage some timesay for about a year
you bet
i'll write a play for you
won't that be good
and i'll act in it
and then some time when we have more moneyold adam's death was always thus tactfully alluded towe'll build a magnificent estate won't we
oh yes with private swimming pools
dozens of them
and private rivers
oh i wish it were now
odd coincidencehe had just been wishing that very thing
they plunged like divers into the dark eddying crowd and emerging in the cool fifties sauntered indolently homeward infinitely romantic to each other  both were walking alone in a dispassionate garden with a ghost found in a dream
halcyon days like boats drifting along slowmoving rivers spring evenings full of a plaintive melancholy that made the past beautiful and bitter bidding them look back and see that the loves of other summers long gone were dead with the forgotten waltzes of their years
always the most poignant moments were when some artificial barrier kept them apart in the theatre their hands would steal together join give and return gentle pressures through the long dark in crowded rooms they would form words with their lips for each other's eyesnot knowing that they were but following in the footsteps of dusty generations but comprehending dimly that if truth is the end of life happiness is a mode of it to be cherished in its brief and tremulous moment
and then one fairy night may became june
sixteen days nowfifteenfourteen   three digressions  just before the engagement was announced anthony had gone up to tarrytown to see his grandfather who a little more wizened and grizzly as time played its ultimate chuckling tricks greeted the news with profound cynicism
oh you're going to get married are you
he said this with such a dubious mildness and shook his head up and down so many times that anthony was not a little depressed
while he was unaware of his grandfather's intentions he presumed that a large part of the money would come to him
a good deal would go in charities of course a good deal to carry on the business of reform
are you going to work
why temporized anthony somewhat disconcerted
i am working
you know  ah i mean work said adam patch dispassionately
i'm not quite sure yet what i'll do
i'm not exactly a beggar grampa he asserted with some spirit
the old man considered this with eyes half closed
then almost apologetically he asked  how much do you save a year
nothing so far  and so after just managing to get along on your money you've decided that by some miracle two of you can get along on it
gloria has some money of her own
enough to buy clothes
how much
without considering this question impertinent anthony answered it
about a hundred a month
that's altogether about seventyfive hundred a year
then he added softly it ought to be plenty
if you have any sense it ought to be plenty
but the question is whether you have any or not
i suppose it is
it was shameful to be compelled to endure this pious browbeating from the old man and his next words were stiffened with vanity
i can manage very well
you seem convinced that i'm utterly worthless
at any rate i came up here simply to tell you that i'm getting married in june
goodby sir
with this he turned away and headed for the door unaware that in that instant his grandfather for the first time rather liked him
wait
called adam patch i want to talk to you
anthony faced about
well sir
sit down
stay all night
somewhat mollified anthony resumed his seat
i'm sorry sir but i'm going to see gloria tonight
what's her name
gloria gilbert
new york girl
someone you know
she's from the middle west
what business her father in
in a celluloid corporation or trust or something
they're from kansas city
you going to be married out there
why no sir
we thought we'd be married in new yorkrather quietly
like to have the wedding out here
anthony hesitated
the suggestion made no appeal to him but it was certainly the part of wisdom to give the old man if possible a proprietary interest in his married life
in addition anthony was a little touched
that's very kind of you grampa but wouldn't it be a lot of trouble
everything's a lot of trouble
your father was married herebut in the old house
whyi thought he was married in boston
adam patch considered
that's true
he was married in boston
anthony felt a moment's embarrassment at having made the correction and he covered it up with words
well i'll speak to gloria about it
personally i'd like to but of course it's up to the gilberts you see
his grandfather drew a long sigh half closed his eyes and sank back in his chair
in a hurry
he asked in a different tone
not especially
i wonder began adam patch looking out with a mild kindly glance at the lilac bushes that rustled against the windows i wonder if you ever think about the afterlife
whysometimes
i think a great deal about the afterlife
his eyes were dim but his voice was confident and clear
i was sitting here today thinking about what's lying in wait for us and somehow i began to remember an afternoon nearly sixtyfive years ago when i was playing with my little sister annie down where that summerhouse is now
he pointed out into the long flowergarden his eyes trembling of tears his voice shaking
i began thinkingand it seemed to me that you ought to think a little more about the afterlife
you ought to besteadierhe paused and seemed to grope about for the right wordmore industriouswhy  then his expression altered his entire personality seemed to snap together like a trap and when he continued the softness had gone from his voice  
why when i was just two years older than you he rasped with a cunning chuckle i sent three members of the firm of wrenn and hunt to the poorhouse
anthony started with embarrassment
well goodby added his grandfather suddenly you'll miss your train
anthony left the house unusually elated and strangely sorry for the old man not because his wealth could buy him neither youth nor digestion but because he had asked anthony to be married there and because he had forgotten something about his son's wedding that he should have remembered
richard caramel who was one of the ushers caused anthony and gloria much distress in the last few weeks by continually stealing the rays of their spotlight
the demon lover had been published in april and it interrupted the love affair as it may be said to have interrupted everything its author came in contact with
it was a highly original rather overwritten piece of sustained description concerned with a don juan of the new york slums
as maury and anthony had said before as the more hospitable critics were saying then there was no writer in america with such power to describe the atavistic and unsubtle reactions of that section of society
the book hesitated and then suddenly went
editions small at first then larger crowded each other week by week
a spokesman of the salvation army denounced it as a cynical misrepresentation of all the uplift taking place in the underworld
clever pressagenting spread the unfounded rumor that gypsy smith was beginning a libel suit because one of the principal characters was a burlesque of himself
it was barred from the public library of burlington iowa and a midwestern columnist announced by innuendo that richard caramel was in a sanitarium with delirium tremens
the author indeed spent his days in a state of pleasant madness
the book was in his conversation threefourths of the timehe wanted to know if one had heard the latest he would go into a store and in a loud voice order books to be charged to him in order to catch a chance morsel of recognition from clerk or customer
he knew to a town in what sections of the country it was selling best he knew exactly what he cleared on each edition and when he met any one who had not read it or as it happened only too often had not heard of it he succumbed to moody depression
so it was natural for anthony and gloria to decide in their jealousy that he was so swollen with conceit as to be a bore
to dick's great annoyance gloria publicly boasted that she had never read the demon lover and didn't intend to until every one stopped talking about it
as a matter of fact she had no time to read now for the presents were pouring infirst a scattering then an avalanche varying from the bricbrac of forgotten family friends to the photographs of forgotten poor relations
maury gave them an elaborate drinking set which included silver goblets cocktail shaker and bottleopeners
the extortion from dick was more conventionala tea set from tiffany's
from joseph bloeckman came a simple and exquisite travelling clock with his card
there was even a cigaretteholder from bounds this touched anthony and made him want to weepindeed any emotion short of hysteria seemed natural in the halfdozen people who were swept up by this tremendous sacrifice to convention
the room set aside in the plaza bulged with offerings sent by harvard friends and by associates of his grandfather with remembrances of gloria's farmover days and with rather pathetic trophies from her former beaux which last arrived with esoteric melancholy messages written on cards tucked carefully inside beginning i little thought when or i'm sure i wish you all the happiness or even when you get this i shall be on my way to  the most munificent gift was simultaneously the most disappointing
it was a concession of adam patch'sa check for five thousand dollars
to most of the presents anthony was cold
it seemed to him that they would necessitate keeping a chart of the marital status of all their acquaintances during the next halfcentury
but gloria exulted in each one tearing at the tissuepaper and excelsior with the rapaciousness of a dog digging for a bone breathlessly seizing a ribbon or an edge of metal and finally bringing to light the whole article and holding it up critically no emotion except rapt interest in her unsmiling face
look anthony
darn nice isn't it
no answer until an hour later when she would give him a careful account of her precise reaction to the gift whether it would have been improved by being smaller or larger whether she was surprised at getting it and if so just how much surprised
mrs gilbert arranged and rearranged a hypothetical house distributing the gifts among the different rooms tabulating articles as secondbest clock or silver to use every day and embarrassing anthony and gloria by semifacetious references to a room she called the nursery
she was pleased by old adam's gift and thereafter had it that he was a very ancient soul as much as anything else
as adam patch never quite decided whether she referred to the advancing senility of his mind or to some private and psychic schema of her own it cannot be said to have pleased him
indeed he always spoke of her to anthony as that old woman the mother as though she were a character in a comedy he had seen staged many times before
concerning gloria he was unable to make up his mind
she attracted him but as she herself told anthony he had decided that she was frivolous and was afraid to approve of her
five daysa dancing platform was being erected on the lawn at tarrytown
four daysa special train was chartered to convey the guests to and from new york
three days   the diary  she was dressed in blue silk pajamas and standing by her bed with her hand on the light to put the room in darkness when she changed her mind and opening a table drawer brought out a little black booka lineaday diary
this she had kept for seven years
many of the pencil entries were almost illegible and there were notes and references to nights and afternoons long since forgotten for it was not an intimate diary even though it began with the immemorial i am going to keep a diary for my children
yet as she thumbed over the pages the eyes of many men seemed to look out at her from their halfobliterated names
with one she had gone to new haven for the first timein  when she was sixteen and padded shoulders were fashionable at yaleshe had been flattered because touch down michaud had rushed her all evening
she sighed remembering the grownup satin dress she had been so proud of and the orchestra playing yamayama my yama man and jungletown
so long agothe names eltynge reardon jim parsons curly mcgregor kenneth cowan fisheye fry whom she had liked for being so ugly carter kirbyhe had sent her a present so had tudor bairdmarty reffer the first man she had been in love with for more than a day and stuart holcome who had run away with her in his automobile and tried to make her marry him by force
and larry fenwick whom she had always admired because he had told her one night that if she wouldn't kiss him she could get out of his car and walk home
what a list
 and after all an obsolete list
she was in love now set for the eternal romance that was to be the synthesis of all romance yet sad for these men and these moonlights and for the thrills she had hadand the kisses
the pasther past oh what a joy
she had been exuberantly happy
turning over the pages her eyes rested idly on the scattered entries of the past four months
she read the last few carefully
april sti know bill carstairs hates me because i was so disagreeable but i hate to be sentimentalized over sometimes
we drove out to the rockyear country club and the most wonderful moon kept shining through the trees
my silver dress is getting tarnished
funny how one forgets the other nights at rockyearwith kenneth cowan when i loved him so
april rdafter two hours of schroeder who they inform me has millions i've decided that this matter of sticking to things wears one out particularly when the things concerned are men
there's nothing so often overdone and from today i swear to be amused
we talked about 'love'how banal
with how many men have i talked about love
april thpatch actually called up today
and when he forswore me about a month ago he fairly raged out the door
i'm gradually losing faith in any man being susceptible to fatal injuries
april thspent the day with anthony
maybe i'll marry him some time
i kind of like his ideashe stimulates all the originality in me
blockhead came around about ten in his new car and took me out riverside drive
i liked him tonight he's so considerate
he knew i didn't want to talk so he was quiet all during the ride
april stwoke up thinking of anthony and sure enough he called and sounded sweet on the phoneso i broke a date for him
today i feel i'd break anything for him including the ten commandments and my neck
he's coming at eight and i shall wear pink and look very fresh and starched  she paused here remembering that after he had gone that night she had undressed with the shivering april air streaming in the windows
yet it seemed she had not felt the cold warmed by the profound banalities burning in her heart
the next entry occurred a few days later  april thi want to marry anthony because husbands are so often 'husbands' and i must marry a lover
there are four general types of husbands
 the husband who always wants to stay in in the evening has no vices and works for a salary
totally undesirable
 the atavistic master whose mistress one is to wait on his pleasure
this sort always considers every pretty woman 'shallow' a sort of peacock with arrested development
 next comes the worshipper the idolater of his wife and all that is his to the utter oblivion of everything else
this sort demands an emotional actress for a wife
god
it must be an exertion to be thought righteous
 and anthonya temporarily passionate lover with wisdom enough to realize when it has flown and that it must fly
and i want to get married to anthony
what grubworms women are to crawl on their bellies through colorless marriages
marriage was created not to be a background but to need one
mine is going to be outstanding
it can't shan't be the settingit's going to be the performance the live lovely glamourous performance and the world shall be the scenery
i refuse to dedicate my life to posterity
surely one owes as much to the current generation as to one's unwanted children
what a fateto grow rotund and unseemly to lose my selflove to think in terms of milk oatmeal nurse diapers dear dream children how much more beautiful you are dazzling little creatures who flutter all dream children must flutter on golden golden wings  such children however poor dear babies have little in common with the wedded state
june thmoral question was it wrong to make bloeckman love me
because i did really make him
he was almost sweetly sad tonight
how opportune it was that my throat is swollen plunk together and tears were easy to muster
but he's just the pastburied already in my plentiful lavender
june thand today i've promised not to chew my mouth
well i won't i supposebut if he'd only asked me not to eat
blowing bubblesthat's what we're doing anthony and me
and we blew such beautiful ones today and they'll explode and then we'll blow more and more i guessbubbles just as big and just as beautiful until all the soap and water is used up
on this note the diary ended
her eyes wandered up the page over the june th's of   
the earliest entry was scrawled in the plump bulbous hand of a sixteenyearold girlit was the name bob lamar and a word she could not decipher
then she knew what it wasand knowing she found her eyes misty with tears
there in a graying blur was the record of her first kiss faded as its intimate afternoon on a rainy veranda seven years before
she seemed to remember something one of them had said that day and yet she could not remember
her tears came faster until she could scarcely see the page
she was crying she told herself because she could remember only the rain and the wet flowers in the yard and the smell of the damp grass
 after a moment she found a pencil and holding it unsteadily drew three parallel lines beneath the last entry
then she printed finis in large capitals put the book back in the drawer and crept into bed
breath of the cave  back in his apartment after the bridal dinner anthony snapped out his lights and feeling impersonal and fragile as a piece of china waiting on a serving table got into bed
it was a warm nighta sheet was enough for comfortand through his wideopen windows came sound evanescent and summery alive with remote anticipation
he was thinking that the young years behind him hollow and colorful had been lived in facile and vacillating cynicism upon the recorded emotions of men long dust
and there was something beyond that he knew now
there was the union of his soul with gloria's whose radiant fire and freshness was the living material of which the dead beauty of books was made
from the night into his highwalled room there came persistently that evanescent and dissolving soundsomething the city was tossing up and calling back again like a child playing with a ball
in harlem the bronx gramercy park and along the waterfronts in little parlors or on pebblestrewn moonflooded roofs a thousand lovers were making this sound crying little fragments of it into the air
all the city was playing with this sound out there in the blue summer dark throwing it up and calling it back promising that in a little while life would be beautiful as a story promising happinessand by that promise giving it
it gave love hope in its own survival
it could do no more
it was then that a new note separated itself jarringly from the soft crying of the night
it was a noise from an areaway within a hundred feet from his rear window the noise of a woman's laughter
it began low incessant and whiningsome servantmaid with her fellow he thoughtand then it grew in volume and became hysterical until it reminded him of a girl he had seen overcome with nervous laughter at a vaudeville performance
then it sank receded only to rise again and include wordsa coarse joke some bit of obscure horseplay he could not distinguish
it would break off for a moment and he would just catch the low rumble of a man's voice then begin againinterminably at first annoying then strangely terrible
he shivered and getting up out of bed went to the window
it had reached a high point tensed and stifled almost the quality of a screamthen it ceased and left behind it a silence empty and menacing as the greater silence overhead
anthony stood by the window a moment longer before he returned to his bed
he found himself upset and shaken
try as he might to strangle his reaction some animal quality in that unrestrained laughter had grasped at his imagination and for the first time in four months aroused his old aversion and horror toward all the business of life
the room had grown smothery
he wanted to be out in some cool and bitter breeze miles above the cities and to live serene and detached back in the corners of his mind
life was that sound out there that ghastly reiterated female sound
oh my god
he cried drawing in his breath sharply
burying his face in the pillows he tried in vain to concentrate upon the details of the next day
morning  in the gray light he found that it was only five o'clock
he regretted nervously that he had awakened so earlyhe would appear fagged at the wedding
he envied gloria who could hide her fatigue with careful pigmentation
in his bathroom he contemplated himself in the mirror and saw that he was unusually whitehalf a dozen small imperfections stood out against the morning pallor of his complexion and overnight he had grown the faint stubble of a beardthe general effect he fancied was unprepossessing haggard half unwell
on his dressing table were spread a number of articles which he told over carefully with suddenly fumbling fingerstheir tickets to california the book of traveller's checks his watch set to the half minute the key to his apartment which he must not forget to give to maury and most important of all the ring
it was of platinum set around with small emeralds gloria had insisted on this she had always wanted an emerald wedding ring she said
it was the third present he had given her first had come the engagement ring and then a little gold cigarettecase
he would be giving her many things nowclothes and jewels and friends and excitement
it seemed absurd that from now on he would pay for all her meals
it was going to cost he wondered if he had not underestimated for this trip and if he had not better cash a larger check
the question worried him
then the breathless impendency of the event swept his mind clear of details
this was the dayunsought unsuspected six months before but now breaking in yellow light through his east window dancing along the carpet as though the sun were smiling at some ancient and reiterated gag of his own
anthony laughed in a nervous onesyllable snort
by god
he muttered to himself i'm as good as married
the ushers  six young men in cross patch's library growing more and more cheery under the influence of mumm's extra dry set surreptitiously in cold pails by the bookcases  the first young man by golly

otis i was usher last month for old charlie mcintyre and  they move slowly toward the door as the chatter becomes a babel and the practising preliminary to the overture issues in long pious groans from adam patch's organ
anthony  there were five hundred eyes boring through the back of his cutaway and the sun glinting on the clergyman's inappropriately bourgeois teeth
with difficulty he restrained a laugh
gloria was saying something in a clear proud voice and he tried to think that the affair was irrevocable that every second was significant that his life was being slashed into two periods and that the face of the world was changing before him
he tried to recapture that ecstatic sensation of ten weeks before
all these emotions eluded him he did not even feel the physical nervousness of that very morningit was all one gigantic aftermath
and those gold teeth
he wondered if the clergyman were married he wondered perversely if a clergyman could perform his own marriage service
but as he took gloria into his arms he was conscious of a strong reaction
the blood was moving in his veins now
a languorous and pleasant content settled like a weight upon him bringing responsibility and possession
he was married
gloria  so many such mingled emotions that no one of them was separable from the others
she could have wept for her mother who was crying quietly back there ten feet and for the loveliness of the june sunlight flooding in at the windows
she was beyond all conscious perceptions
only a sense colored with delirious wild excitement that the ultimately important was happeningand a trust fierce and passionate burning in her like a prayer that in a moment she would be forever and securely safe
late one night they arrived in santa barbara where the night clerk at the hotel lafcadio refused to admit them on the grounds that they were not married
the clerk thought that gloria was beautiful
he did not think that anything so beautiful as gloria could be moral
con amore  that first halfyearthe trip west the long months' loiter along the california coast and the gray house near greenwich where they lived until late autumn made the country drearythose days those places saw the enraptured hours
the breathless idyl of their engagement gave way first to the intense romance of the more passionate relationship
the breathless idyl left them fled on to other lovers they looked around one day and it was gone how they scarcely knew
had either of them lost the other in the days of the idyl the love lost would have been ever to the loser that dim desire without fulfilment which stands back of all life
but magic must hurry on and the lovers remain
the idyl passed bearing with it its extortion of youth
came a day when gloria found that other men no longer bored her came a day when anthony discovered that he could sit again late into the evening talking with dick of those tremendous abstractions that had once occupied his world
but knowing they had had the best of love they clung to what remained
love lingeredby way of long conversations at night into those stark hours when the mind thins and sharpens and the borrowings from dreams become the stuff of all life by way of deep and intimate kindnesses they developed toward each other by way of their laughing at the same absurdities and thinking the same things noble and the same things sad
it was first of all a time of discovery
the things they found in each other were so diverse so intermixed and moreover so sugared with love as to seem at the time not so much discoveries as isolated phenomenato be allowed for and to be forgotten
anthony found that he was living with a girl of tremendous nervous tension and of the most highhanded selfishness
gloria knew within a month that her husband was an utter coward toward any one of a million phantasms created by his imagination
her perception was intermittent for this cowardice sprang out became almost obscenely evident then faded and vanished as though it had been only a creation of her own mind
her reactions to it were not those attributed to her sexit roused her neither to disgust nor to a premature feeling of motherhood
herself almost completely without physical fear she was unable to understand and so she made the most of what she felt to be his fear's redeeming feature which was that though he was a coward under a shock and a coward under a strainwhen his imagination was given playhe had yet a sort of dashing recklessness that moved her on its brief occasions almost to admiration and a pride that usually steadied him when he thought he was observed
the trait first showed itself in a dozen incidents of little more than nervousnesshis warning to a taxidriver against fast driving in chicago his refusal to take her to a certain tough caf she had always wished to visit these of course admitted the conventional interpretationthat it was of her he had been thinking nevertheless their culminative weight disturbed her
but something that occurred in a san francisco hotel when they had been married a week gave the matter certainty
it was after midnight and pitch dark in their room
gloria was dozing off and anthony's even breathing beside her made her suppose that he was asleep when suddenly she saw him raise himself on his elbow and stare at the window
what is it dearest
she murmured
nothinghe had relaxed to his pillow and turned toward hernothing my darling wife
don't say 'wife'
i'm your mistress
wife's such an ugly word
your 'permanent mistress' is so much more tangible and desirable come into my arms she added in a rush of tenderness i can sleep so well so well with you in my arms
coming into gloria's arms had a quite definite meaning
it required that he should slide one arm under her shoulder lock both arms about her and arrange himself as nearly as possible as a sort of threesided crib for her luxurious ease
anthony who tossed whose arms went tinglingly to sleep after half an hour of that position would wait until she was asleep and roll her gently over to her side of the bedthen left to his own devices he would curl himself into his usual knots
gloria having attained sentimental comfort retired into her doze
five minutes ticked away on bloeckman's travelling clock silence lay all about the room over the unfamiliar impersonal furniture and the halfoppressive ceiling that melted imperceptibly into invisible walls on both sides
then there was suddenly a rattling flutter at the window staccato and loud upon the hushed pent air
with a leap anthony was out of the bed and standing tense beside it
who's there
he cried in an awful voice
gloria lay very still wide awake now and engrossed not so much in the rattling as in the rigid breathless figure whose voice had reached from the bedside into that ominous dark
the sound stopped the room was quiet as beforethen anthony pouring words in at the telephone
some one just tried to get into the room
  there's some one at the window
his voice was emphatic now faintly terrified
all right
hurry
he hung up the receiver stood motionless

there was a rush and commotion at the door a knockinganthony went to open it upon an excited night clerk with three bellboys grouped staring behind him
between thumb and finger the night clerk held a wet pen with the threat of a weapon one of the bellboys had seized a telephone directory and was looking at it sheepishly
simultaneously the group was joined by the hastily summoned housedetective and as one man they surged into the room
lights sprang on with a click
gathering a piece of sheet about her gloria dove away from sight shutting her eyes to keep out the horror of this unpremeditated visitation
there was no vestige of an idea in her stricken sensibilities save that her anthony was at grievous fault

the night clerk was speaking from the window his tone half of the servant half of the teacher reproving a schoolboy
nobody out there he declared conclusively my golly nobody could be out there
this here's a sheer fall to the street of fifty feet
it was the wind you heard tugging at the blind
oh
then she was sorry for him
she wanted only to comfort him and draw him back tenderly into her arms to tell them to go away because the thing their presence connotated was odious
yet she could not raise her head for shame
she heard a broken sentence apologies conventions of the employee and one unrestrained snicker from a bellboy
i've been nervous as the devil all evening anthony was saying somehow that noise just shook mei was only about half awake
sure i understand said the night clerk with comfortable tact been that way myself
the door closed the lights snapped out anthony crossed the floor quietly and crept into bed
gloria feigning to be heavy with sleep gave a quiet little sigh and slipped into his arms
what was it dear
nothing he answered his voice still shaken i thought there was somebody at the window so i looked out but i couldn't see any one and the noise kept up so i phoned downstairs
sorry if i disturbed you but i'm awfully darn nervous tonight
catching the lie she gave an interior starthe had not gone to the window nor near the window
he had stood by the bed and then sent in his call of fear
oh she saidand then i'm so sleepy
for an hour they lay awake side by side gloria with her eyes shut so tight that blue moons formed and revolved against backgrounds of deepest mauve anthony staring blindly into the darkness overhead
after many weeks it came gradually out into the light to be laughed and joked at
they made a tradition to fit over itwhenever that overpowering terror of the night attacked anthony she would put her arms about him and croon soft as a song  i'll protect my anthony
oh nobody's ever going to harm my anthony
he would laugh as though it were a jest they played for their mutual amusement but to gloria it was never quite a jest
it was at first a keen disappointment later it was one of the times when she controlled her temper
the management of gloria's temper whether it was aroused by a lack of hot water for her bath or by a skirmish with her husband became almost the primary duty of anthony's day
it must be done just soby this much silence by that much pressure by this much yielding by that much force
it was in her angers with their attendant cruelties that her inordinate egotism chiefly displayed itself
because she was brave because she was spoiled because of her outrageous and commendable independence of judgment and finally because of her arrogant consciousness that she had never seen a girl as beautiful as herself gloria had developed into a consistent practising nietzschean
this of course with overtones of profound sentiment
there was for example her stomach
she was used to certain dishes and she had a strong conviction that she could not possibly eat anything else
there must be a lemonade and a tomato sandwich late in the morning then a light lunch with a stuffed tomato
not only did she require food from a selection of a dozen dishes but in addition this food must be prepared in just a certain way
one of the most annoying half hours of the first fortnight occurred in los angeles when an unhappy waiter brought her a tomato stuffed with chicken salad instead of celery
we always serve it that way madame he quavered to the gray eyes that regarded him wrathfully
gloria made no answer but when the waiter had turned discreetly away she banged both fists upon the table until the china and silver rattled
poor gloria
laughed anthony unwittingly you can't get what you want ever can you
i can't eat stuff
she flared up
i'll call back the waiter
i don't want you to
he doesn't know anything the darn fool
well it isn't the hotel's fault
either send it back forget it or be a sport and eat it
shut up
she said succinctly
why take it out on me
oh i'm not she wailed but i simply can't eat it
anthony subsided helplessly
we'll go somewhere else he suggested
i don't want to go anywhere else
i'm tired of being trotted around to a dozen cafs and not getting one thing fit to eat
when did we go around to a dozen cafs
you'd have to in this town insisted gloria with ready sophistry
anthony bewildered tried another tack
why don't you try to eat it
it can't be as bad as you think
justbecauseidon'tlikechicken
she picked up her fork and began poking contemptuously at the tomato and anthony expected her to begin flinging the stuffings in all directions
he was sure that she was approximately as angry as she had ever beenfor an instant he had detected a spark of hate directed as much toward him as toward any one elseand gloria angry was for the present unapproachable
then surprisingly he saw that she had tentatively raised the fork to her lips and tasted the chicken salad
her frown had not abated and he stared at her anxiously making no comment and daring scarcely to breathe
she tasted another forkfulin another moment she was eating
with difficulty anthony restrained a chuckle when at length he spoke his words had no possible connection with chicken salad
this incident with variations ran like a lugubrious fugue through the first year of marriage always it left anthony baffled irritated and depressed
but another rough brushing of temperaments a question of laundrybags he found even more annoying as it ended inevitably in a decisive defeat for him
one afternoon in coronado where they made the longest stay of their trip more than three weeks gloria was arraying herself brilliantly for tea
anthony who had been downstairs listening to the latest rumor bulletins of war in europe entered the room kissed the back of her powdered neck and went to his dresser
after a great pulling out and pushing in of drawers evidently unsatisfactory he turned around to the unfinished masterpiece
got any handkerchiefs gloria
he asked
gloria shook her golden head
not a one
i'm using one of yours
the last one i deduce
he laughed dryly
is it
she applied an emphatic though very delicate contour to her lips
isn't the laundry back
i don't know
anthony hesitatedthen with sudden discernment opened the closet door
his suspicions were verified
on the hook provided hung the blue bag furnished by the hotel
this was full of his clotheshe had put them there himself
the floor beneath it was littered with an astonishing mass of finerylingerie stockings dresses nightgowns and pajamasmost of it scarcely worn but all of it coming indubitably under the general heading of gloria's laundry
he stood holding the closet door open
why gloria
what
the lip line was being erased and corrected according to some mysterious perspective not a finger trembled as she manipulated the lipstick not a glance wavered in his direction
it was a triumph of concentration
haven't you ever sent out the laundry
is it there
it most certainly is
well i guess i haven't then
gloria began anthony sitting down on the bed and trying to catch her mirrored eyes you're a nice fellow you are
i've sent it out every time it's been sent since we left new york and over a week ago you promised you'd do it for a change
all you'd have to do would be to cram your own junk into that bag and ring for the chambermaid
oh why fuss about the laundry
exclaimed gloria petulantly i'll take care of it
i haven't fussed about it
i'd just as soon divide the bother with you but when we run out of handkerchiefs it's darn near time something's done
anthony considered that he was being extraordinarily logical
but gloria unimpressed put away her cosmetics and casually offered him her back
hook me up she suggested anthony dearest i forgot all about it
i meant to honestly and i will today
don't be cross with your sweetheart
what could anthony do then but draw her down upon his knee and kiss a shade of color from her lips
but i don't mind she murmured with a smile radiant and magnanimous
you can kiss all the paint off my lips any time you want
they went down to tea
they bought some handkerchiefs in a notion store near by
all was forgotten
but two days later anthony looked in the closet and saw the bag still hung limp upon its hook and that the gay and vivid pile on the floor had increased surprisingly in height
gloria
he cried
oh her voice was full of real distress
despairingly anthony went to the phone and called the chambermaid
it seems to me he said impatiently that you expect me to be some sort of french valet to you
gloria laughed so infectiously that anthony was unwise enough to smile
unfortunate man
in some intangible manner his smile made her mistress of the situationwith an air of injured righteousness she went emphatically to the closet and began pushing her laundry violently into the bag
anthony watched herashamed of himself
there
she said implying that her fingers had been worked to the bone by a brutal taskmaster
he considered nevertheless that he had given her an objectlesson and that the matter was closed but on the contrary it was merely beginning
laundry pile followed laundry pileat long intervals dearth of handkerchief followed dearth of handkerchiefat short ones not to mention dearth of sock of shirt of everything
and anthony found at length that either he must send it out himself or go through the increasingly unpleasant ordeal of a verbal battle with gloria
gloria and general lee  on their way east they stopped two days in washington strolling about with some hostility in its atmosphere of harsh repellent light of distance without freedom of pomp without splendorit seemed a pastypale and selfconscious city
the second day they made an illadvised trip to general lee's old home at arlington
the bus which bore them was crowded with hot unprosperous people and anthony intimate to gloria felt a storm brewing
it broke at the zoo where the party stopped for ten minutes
the zoo it seemed smelt of monkeys
anthony laughed gloria called down the curse of heaven upon monkeys including in her malevolence all the passengers of the bus and their perspiring offspring who had hied themselves monkeyward
eventually the bus moved on to arlington
there it met other busses and immediately a swarm of women and children were leaving a trail of peanutshells through the halls of general lee and crowding at length into the room where he was married
on the wall of this room a pleasing sign announced in large red letters ladies' toilet
at this final blow gloria broke down
i think it's perfectly terrible
she said furiously the idea of letting these people come here
and of encouraging them by making these houses showplaces
well objected anthony if they weren't kept up they'd go to pieces
what if they did
she exclaimed as they sought the wide pillared porch
do you think they've left a breath of  here
this has become a thing of 
don't you want to preserve old things
but you can't anthony
beautiful things grow to a certain height and then they fail and fade off breathing out memories as they decay
and just as any period decays in our minds the things of that period should decay too and in that way they're preserved for a while in the few hearts like mine that react to them
that graveyard at tarrytown for instance
the asses who give money to preserve things have spoiled that too
sleepy hollow's gone washington irving's dead and his books are rotting in our estimation year by yearthen let the graveyard rot too as it should as all things should
trying to preserve a century by keeping its relics up to date is like keeping a dying man alive by stimulants
so you think that just as a time goes to pieces its houses ought to go too
of course
would you value your keats letter if the signature was traced over to make it last longer
it's just because i love the past that i want this house to look back on its glamourous moment of youth and beauty and i want its stairs to creak as if to the footsteps of women with hoop skirts and men in boots and spurs
but they've made it into a blondined rougedup old woman of sixty
it hasn't any right to look so prosperous
it might care enough for lee to drop a brick now and then
how many of thesethese animalsshe waved her hand aroundget anything from this for all the histories and guidebooks and restorations in existence
how many of them who think that at best appreciation is talking in undertones and walking on tiptoes would even come here if it was any trouble
i want it to smell of magnolias instead of peanuts and i want my shoes to crunch on the same gravel that lee's boots crunched on
there's no beauty without poignancy and there's no poignancy without the feeling that it's going men names books housesbound for dustmortal  a small boy appeared beside them and swinging a handful of bananapeels flung them valiantly in the direction of the potomac
sentiment  simultaneously with the fall of lige anthony and gloria arrived in new york
in retrospect the six weeks seemed miraculously happy
they had found to a great extent as most young couples find in some measure that they possessed in common many fixed ideas and curiosities and odd quirks of mind they were essentially companionable
but it had been a struggle to keep many of their conversations on the level of discussions
arguments were fatal to gloria's disposition
she had all her life been associated either with her mental inferiors or with men who under the almost hostile intimidation of her beauty had not dared to contradict her naturally then it irritated her when anthony emerged from the state in which her pronouncements were an infallible and ultimate decision
he failed to realize at first that this was the result partly of her female education and partly of her beauty and he was inclined to include her with her entire sex as curiously and definitely limited
it maddened him to find she had no sense of justice
but he discovered that when a subject did interest her her brain tired less quickly than his
what he chiefly missed in her mind was the pedantic teleologythe sense of order and accuracy the sense of life as a mysteriously correlated piece of patchwork but he understood after a while that such a quality in her would have been incongruous
of the things they possessed in common greatest of all was their almost uncanny pull at each other's hearts
the day they left the hotel in coronado she sat down on one of the beds while they were packing and began to weep bitterly
dearest his arms were around her he pulled her head down upon his shoulder
what is it my own gloria
tell me
we're going away she sobbed
oh anthony it's sort of the first place we've lived together
our two little beds hereside by sidethey'll be always waiting for us and we're never coming back to 'em any more
she was tearing at his heart as she always could
sentiment came over him rushed into his eyes
gloria why we're going on to another room
and two other little beds
we're going to be together all our lives
words flooded from her in a low husky voice
but it won't belike our two bedsever again
everywhere we go and move on and change something's lostsomething's left behind
you can't ever quite repeat anything and i've been so yours here  he held her passionately near discerning far beyond any criticism of her sentiment a wise grasping of the minute if only an indulgence of her desire to crygloria the idler caresser of her own dreams extracting poignancy from the memorable things of life and youth
later in the afternoon when he returned from the station with the tickets he found her asleep on one of the beds her arm curled about a black object which he could not at first identify
coming closer he found it was one of his shoes not a particularly new one nor clean one but her face tearstained was pressed against it and he understood her ancient and most honorable message
there was almost ecstasy in waking her and seeing her smile at him shy but well aware of her own nicety of imagination
with no appraisal of the worth or dross of these two things it seemed to anthony that they lay somewhere near the heart of love
the gray house  it is in the twenties that the actual momentum of life begins to slacken and it is a simple soul indeed to whom as many things are significant and meaningful at thirty as at ten years before
at thirty an organgrinder is a more or less motheaten man who grinds an organand once he was an organgrinder
the unmistakable stigma of humanity touches all those impersonal and beautiful things that only youth ever grasps in their impersonal glory
a brilliant ball gay with light romantic laughter wears through its own silks and satins to show the bare framework of a manmade thingoh that eternal handa play most tragic and most divine becomes merely a succession of speeches sweated over by the eternal plagiarist in the clammy hours and acted by men subject to cramps cowardice and manly sentiment
and this time with gloria and anthony this first year of marriage and the gray house caught them in that stage when the organgrinder was slowly undergoing his inevitable metamorphosis
she was twentythree he was twentysix
the gray house was at first of sheerly pastoral intent
they lived impatiently in anthony's apartment for the first fortnight after the return from california in a stifled atmosphere of open trunks too many callers and the eternal laundrybags
they discussed with their friends the stupendous problem of their future
dick and maury would sit with them agreeing solemnly almost thoughtfully as anthony ran through his list of what they ought to do and where they ought to live
i'd like to take gloria abroad he complained except for this damn warand next to that i'd sort of like to have a place in the country somewhere near new york of course where i could writeor whatever i decide to do
gloria laughed
isn't he cute
she required of maury
'whatever he decides to do'
but what am i going to do if he works
maury will you take me around if anthony works
anyway i'm not going to work yet said anthony quickly
it was vaguely understood between them that on some misty day he would enter a sort of glorified diplomatic service and be envied by princes and prime ministers for his beautiful wife
well said gloria helplessly i'm sure i don't know
we talk and talk and never get anywhere and we ask all our friends and they just answer the way we want 'em to
i wish somebody'd take care of us
why don't you go out toout to greenwich or something
suggested richard caramel
i'd like that said gloria brightening
do you think we could get a house there
dick shrugged his shoulders and maury laughed
you two amuse me he said
of all the unpractical people
as soon as a place is mentioned you expect us to pull great piles of photographs out of our pockets showing the different styles of architecture available in bungalows
that's just what i don't want wailed gloria a hot stuffy bungalow with a lot of babies next door and their father cutting the grass in his shirt sleeves  for heaven's sake gloria interrupted maury nobody wants to lock you up in a bungalow
who in god's name brought bungalows into the conversation
but you'll never get a place anywhere unless you go out and hunt for it
go where
you say 'go out and hunt for it' but where
with dignity maury waved his hand pawlike about the room
out anywhere
out in the country
there're lots of places
thanks
look here
richard caramel brought his yellow eye rakishly into play
the trouble with you two is that you're all disorganized
do you know anything about new york state
shut up anthony i'm talking to gloria
well she admitted finally i've been to two or three house parties in portchester and around in connecticutbut of course that isn't in new york state is it
and neither is morristown she finished with drowsy irrelevance
there was a shout of laughter
oh lord
cried dick neither is morristown'
no and neither is santa barbara gloria
now listen
to begin with unless you have a fortune there's no use considering any place like newport or southhampton or tuxedo
they're out of the question
they all agreed to this solemnly
and personally i hate new jersey
then of course there's upper new york above tuxedo
too cold said gloria briefly
i was there once in an automobile
well it seems to me there're a lot of towns like rye between new york and greenwich where you could buy a little gray house of some  gloria leaped at the phrase triumphantly
for the first time since their return east she knew what she wanted
oh yes
she cried
oh yes
that's it a little gray house with sort of white around and a whole lot of swamp maples just as brown and gold as an october picture in a gallery
where can we find one
unfortunately i've mislaid my list of little gray houses with swamp maples around thembut i'll try to find it
meanwhile you take a piece of paper and write down the names of seven possible towns
and every day this week you take a trip to one of those towns
oh gosh
protested gloria collapsing mentally why won't you do it for us
i hate trains
well hire a car and  gloria yawned
i'm tired of discussing it
seems to me all we do is talk about where to live
my exquisite wife wearies of thought remarked anthony ironically
she must have a tomato sandwich to stimulate her jaded nerves
let's go out to tea
as the unfortunate upshot of this conversation they took dick's advice literally and two days later went out to rye where they wandered around with an irritated real estate agent like bewildered babes in the wood
they were shown houses at a hundred a month which closely adjoined other houses at a hundred a month they were shown isolated houses to which they invariably took violent dislikes though they submitted weakly to the agent's desire that they look at that stovesome stove
and to a great shaking of doorposts and tapping of walls intended evidently to show that the house would not immediately collapse no matter how convincingly it gave that impression
they gazed through windows into interiors furnished either commercially with slablike chairs and unyielding settees or homelike with the melancholy bricbrac of other summerscrossed tennis rackets fitform couches and depressing gibson girls
with a feeling of guilt they looked at a few really nice houses aloof dignified and coolat three hundred a month
they went away from rye thanking the real estate agent very much indeed
on the crowded train back to new york the seat behind was occupied by a superrespirating latin whose last few meals had obviously been composed entirely of garlic
they reached the apartment gratefully almost hysterically and gloria rushed for a hot bath in the reproachless bathroom
so far as the question of a future abode was concerned both of them were incapacitated for a week
the matter eventually worked itself out with unhopedfor romance
anthony ran into the living room one afternoon fairly radiating the idea
i've got it he was exclaiming as though he had just caught a mouse
we'll get a car
gee whiz
haven't we got troubles enough taking care of ourselves
give me a second to explain can't you
just let's leave our stuff with dick and just pile a couple of suitcases in our car the one we're going to buywe'll have to have one in the country anywayand just start out in the direction of new haven
you see as we get out of commuting distance from new york the rents'll get cheaper and as soon as we find a house we want we'll just settle down
by his frequent and soothing interpolation of the word just he aroused her lethargic enthusiasm
strutting violently about the room he simulated a dynamic and irresistible efficiency
we'll buy a car tomorrow
life limping after imagination's tenleague boots saw them out of town a week later in a cheap but sparkling new roadster saw them through the chaotic unintelligible bronx then over a wide murky district which alternated cheerless bluegreen wastes with suburbs of tremendous and sordid activity
they left new york at eleven and it was well past a hot and beatific noon when they moved rakishly through pelham
these aren't towns said gloria scornfully these are just city blocks plumped down coldly into waste acres
i imagine all the men here have their mustaches stained from drinking their coffee too quickly in the morning
and play pinochle on the commuting trains
what's pinochle
don't be so literal
how should i know
but it sounds as though they ought to play it
i like it
it sounds as if it were something where you sort of cracked your knuckles or something let me drive
anthony looked at her suspiciously
you swear you're a good driver
since i was fourteen
he stopped the car cautiously at the side of the road and they changed seats
then with a horrible grinding noise the car was put in gear gloria adding an accompaniment of laughter which seemed to anthony disquieting and in the worst possible taste
here we go
she yelled
whoooop
their heads snapped back like marionettes on a single wire as the car leaped ahead and curved retchingly about a standing milkwagon whose driver stood up on his seat and bellowed after them
in the immemorial tradition of the road anthony retorted with a few brief epigrams as to the grossness of the milkdelivering profession
he cut his remarks short however and turned to gloria with the growing conviction that he had made a grave mistake in relinquishing control and that gloria was a driver of many eccentricities and of infinite carelessness
remember now
he warned her nervously the man said we oughtn't to go over twenty miles an hour for the first five thousand miles
she nodded briefly but evidently intending to accomplish the prohibitive distance as quickly as possible slightly increased her speed
a moment later he made another attempt
see that sign
do you want to get us pinched
oh for heaven's sake cried gloria in exasperation you always exaggerate things so
well i don't want to get arrested
who's arresting you
you're so persistentjust like you were about my cough medicine last night
it was for your own good
ha
i might as well be living with mama
what a thing to say to me
a standing policeman swerved into view was hastily passed
see him
demanded anthony
oh you drive me crazy
he didn't arrest us did he
when he does it'll be too late countered anthony brilliantly
her reply was scornful almost injured
why this old thing won't go over thirtyfive
it isn't old
it is in spirit
that afternoon the car joined the laundrybags and gloria's appetite as one of the trinity of contention
he warned her of railroad tracks he pointed out approaching automobiles finally he insisted on taking the wheel and a furious insulted gloria sat silently beside him between the towns of larchmont and rye
but it was due to this furious silence of hers that the gray house materialized from its abstraction for just beyond rye he surrendered gloomily to it and rerelinquished the wheel
mutely he beseeched her and gloria instantly cheered vowed to be more careful
but because a discourteous streetcar persisted callously in remaining upon its track gloria ducked down a sidestreetand thereafter that afternoon was never able to find her way back to the post road
the street they finally mistook for it lost its postroad aspect when it had gone five miles from cos cob
its macadam became gravel then dirtmoreover it narrowed and developed a border of maple trees through which filtered the weltering sun making its endless experiments with shadow designs upon the long grass
we're lost now complained anthony
read that sign
mariettafive miles
what's marietta
never heard of it but let's go on
we can't turn here and there's probably a detour back to the post road
the way became scarred with deepening ruts and insidious shoulders of stone
three farmhouses faced them momentarily slid by
a town sprang up in a cluster of dull roofs around a white tall steeple
then gloria hesitating between two approaches and making her choice too late drove over a firehydrant and ripped the transmission violently from the car
it was dark when the realestate agent of marietta showed them the gray house
they came upon it just west of the village where it rested against a sky that was a warm blue cloak buttoned with tiny stars
the gray house had been there when women who kept cats were probably witches when paul revere made false teeth in boston preparatory to arousing the great commercial people when our ancestors were gloriously deserting washington in droves
since those days the house had been bolstered up in a feeble corner considerably repartitioned and newly plastered inside amplified by a kitchen and added to by a sideporchbut save for where some jovial oaf had roofed the new kitchen with red tin colonial it defiantly remained
how did you happen to come to marietta
demanded the realestate agent in a tone that was first cousin to suspicion
he was showing them through four spacious and airy bedrooms
we broke down explained gloria
i drove over a firehydrant and we had ourselves towed to the garage and then we saw your sign
the man nodded unable to follow such a sally of spontaneity
there was something subtly immoral in doing anything without several months' consideration
they signed a lease that night and in the agent's car returned jubilantly to the somnolent and dilapidated marietta inn which was too broken for even the chance immoralities and consequent gaieties of a country roadhouse
half the night they lay awake planning the things they were to do there
anthony was going to work at an astounding pace on his history and thus ingratiate himself with his cynical grandfather
when the car was repaired they would explore the country and join the nearest really nice club where gloria would play golf or something while anthony wrote
this of course was anthony's ideagloria was sure she wanted but to read and dream and be fed tomato sandwiches and lemonades by some angelic servant still in a shadowy hinterland
between paragraphs anthony would come and kiss her as she lay indolently in the hammock
the hammock
a host of new dreams in tune to its imagined rhythm while the wind stirred it and waves of sun undulated over the shadows of blown wheat or the dusty road freckled and darkened with quiet summer rain  and guestshere they had a long argument both of them trying to be extraordinarily mature and farsighted
anthony claimed that they would need people at least every other weekend as a sort of change
this provoked an involved and extremely sentimental conversation as to whether anthony did not consider gloria change enough
though he assured her that he did she insisted upon doubting him
eventually the conversation assumed its eternal monotone what then
oh what'll we do then
well we'll have a dog suggested anthony
i don't want one
i want a kitty
she went thoroughly and with great enthusiasm into the history habits and tastes of a cat she had once possessed
anthony considered that it must have been a horrible character with neither personal magnetism nor a loyal heart
later they slept to wake an hour before dawn with the gray house dancing in phantom glory before their dazzled eyes
the soul of gloria  for that autumn the gray house welcomed them with a rush of sentiment that falsified its cynical old age
true there were the laundrybags there was gloria's appetite there was anthony's tendency to brood and his imaginative nervousness but there were intervals also of an unhopedfor serenity
close together on the porch they would wait for the moon to stream across the silver acres of farmland jump a thick wood and tumble waves of radiance at their feet
in such a moonlight gloria's face was of a pervading reminiscent white and with a modicum of effort they would slip off the blinders of custom and each would find in the other almost the quintessential romance of the vanished june
one night while her head lay upon his heart and their cigarettes glowed in swerving buttons of light through the dome of darkness over the bed she spoke for the first time and fragmentarily of the men who had hung for brief moments on her beauty
do you ever think of them
he asked her
only occasionallywhen something happens that recalls a particular man
what do you remembertheir kisses
all sorts of things men are different with women
different in what way
oh entirelyand quite inexpressibly
men who had the most firmly rooted reputation for being this way or that would sometimes be surprisingly inconsistent with me
brutal men were tender negligible men were astonishingly loyal and lovable and often honorable men took attitudes that were anything but honorable
for instance
well there was a boy named percy wolcott from cornell who was quite a hero in college a great athlete and saved a lot of people from a fire or something like that
but i soon found he was stupid in a rather dangerous way
what way
it seems he had some nave conception of a woman 'fit to be his wife' a particular conception that i used to run into a lot and that always drove me wild
he demanded a girl who'd never been kissed and who liked to sew and sit home and pay tribute to his selfesteem
and i'll bet a hat if he's gotten an idiot to sit and be stupid with him he's tearing out on the side with some much speedier lady
i'd be sorry for his wife
i wouldn't
think what an ass she'd be not to realize it before she married him
he's the sort whose idea of honoring and respecting a woman would be never to give her any excitement
with the best intentions he was deep in the dark ages
what was his attitude toward you
i'm coming to that
as i told youor did i tell youhe was mighty goodlooking big brown honest eyes and one of those smiles that guarantee the heart behind it is twentykarat gold
being young and credulous i thought he had some discretion so i kissed him fervently one night when we were riding around after a dance at the homestead at hot springs
it had been a wonderful week i rememberwith the most luscious trees spread like green lather sort of all over the valley and a mist rising out of them on october mornings like bonfires lit to turn them brown  how about your friend with the ideals
interrupted anthony
it seems that when he kissed me he began to think that perhaps he could get away with a little more that i needn't be 'respected' like this beatrice fairfax gladgirl of his imagination
what'd he do
not much
i pushed him off a sixteenfoot embankment before he was well started
hurt him
inquired anthony with a laugh
broke his arm and sprained his ankle
he told the story all over hot springs and when his arm healed a man named barley who liked me fought him and broke it over again
oh it was all an awful mess
he threatened to sue barley and barleyhe was from georgiawas seen buying a gun in town
but before that mama had dragged me north again much against my will so i never did find out all that happenedthough i saw barley once in the vanderbilt lobby
anthony laughed long and loud
what a career
i suppose i ought to be furious because you've kissed so many men
i'm not though
at this she sat up in bed
it's funny but i'm so sure that those kisses left no mark on meno taint of promiscuity i meaneven though a man once told me in all seriousness that he hated to think i'd been a public drinking glass
he had his nerve
i just laughed and told him to think of me rather as a lovingcup that goes from hand to hand but should be valued none the less
somehow it doesn't bother meon the other hand it would of course if you'd done any more than kiss them
but i believe you're absolutely incapable of jealousy except as hurt vanity
why don't you care what i've done
wouldn't you prefer it if i'd been absolutely innocent
it's all in the impression it might have made on you
my kisses were because the man was goodlooking or because there was a slick moon or even because i've felt vaguely sentimental and a little stirred
but that's allit's had utterly no effect on me
but you'd remember and let memories haunt you and worry you
haven't you ever kissed any one like you've kissed me
no she answered simply
as i've told you men have triedoh lots of things
any pretty girl has that experience you see she resumed it doesn't matter to me how many women you've stayed with in the past so long as it was merely a physical satisfaction but i don't believe i could endure the idea of your ever having lived with another woman for a protracted period or even having wanted to marry some possible girl
it's different somehow
there'd be all the little intimacies rememberedand they'd dull that freshness that after all is the most precious part of love
rapturously he pulled her down beside him on the pillow
oh my darling he whispered as if i remembered anything but your dear kisses
then gloria in a very mild voice  anthony did i hear anybody say they were thirsty
anthony laughed abruptly and with a sheepish and amused grin got out of bed
with just a little piece of ice in the water she added
do you suppose i could have that
gloria used the adjective little whenever she asked a favorit made the favor sound less arduous
but anthony laughed againwhether she wanted a cake of ice or a marble of it he must go downstairs to the kitchen
her voice followed him through the hall and just a little cracker with just a little marmalade on it  oh gosh
sighed anthony in rapturous slang she's wonderful that girl
she has it
when we have a baby she began one daythis it had already been decided was to be after three yearsi want it to look like you
except its legs he insinuated slyly
oh yes except his legs
he's got to have my legs
but the rest of him can be you
my nose
gloria hesitated
well perhaps my nose
but certainly your eyesand my mouth and i guess my shape of the face
i wonder i think he'd be sort of cute if he had my hair
my dear gloria you've appropriated the whole baby
well i didn't mean to she apologized cheerfully
let him have my neck at least he urged regarding himself gravely in the glass
you've often said you liked my neck because the adam's apple doesn't show and besides your neck's too short
why it is not
she cried indignantly turning to the mirror it's just right
i don't believe i've ever seen a better neck
it's too short he repeated teasingly
short
her tone expressed exasperated wonder
short
you're crazy
she elongated and contracted it to convince herself of its reptilian sinuousness
do you call that a short neck
one of the shortest i've ever seen
for the first time in weeks tears started from gloria's eyes and the look she gave him had a quality of real pain
oh anthony  my lord gloria
he approached her in bewilderment and took her elbows in his hands
don't cry please
didn't you know i was only kidding
gloria look at me
why dearest you've got the longest neck i've ever seen
honestly
her tears dissolved in a twisted smile
wellyou shouldn't have said that then
let's talk about the bbaby
anthony paced the floor and spoke as though rehearsing for a debate
to put it briefly there are two babies we could have two distinct and logical babies utterly differentiated
there's the baby that's the combination of the best of both of us
your body my eyes my mind your intelligenceand then there is the baby which is our worstmy body your disposition and my irresolution
i like that second baby she said
what i'd really like continued anthony would be to have two sets of triplets one year apart and then experiment with the six boys  poor me she interjected  
i'd educate them each in a different country and by a different system and when they were twentythree i'd call them together and see what they were like
let's have 'em all with my neck suggested gloria
the end of a chapter  the car was at length repaired and with a deliberate vengeance took up where it left off the business of causing infinite dissension
who should drive
how fast should gloria go
these two questions and the eternal recriminations involved ran through the days
they motored to the postroad towns rye portchester and greenwich and called on a dozen friends mostly gloria's who all seemed to be in different stages of having babies and in this respect as well as in others bored her to a point of nervous distraction
for an hour after each visit she would bite her fingers furiously and be inclined to take out her rancor on anthony
i loathe women she cried in a mild temper
what on earth can you say to themexcept talk 'ladylady'
i've enthused over a dozen babies that i've wanted only to choke
and every one of those girls is either incipiently jealous and suspicious of her husband if he's charming or beginning to be bored with him if he isn't
don't you ever intend to see any women
i don't know
they never seem clean to menevernever
except just a few
constance shawyou know the mrs merriam who came over to see us last tuesdayis almost the only one
she's so tall and freshlooking and stately
i don't like them so tall
though they went to several dinner dances at various country clubs they decided that the autumn was too nearly over for them to go out on any scale even had they been so inclined
he hated golf gloria liked it only mildly and though she enjoyed a violent rush that some undergraduates gave her one night and was glad that anthony should be proud of her beauty she also perceived that their hostess for the evening a mrs granby was somewhat disquieted by the fact that anthony's classmate alec granby joined with enthusiasm in the rush
the granbys never phoned again and though gloria laughed it piqued her not a little
you see she explained to anthony if i wasn't married it wouldn't worry herbut she's been to the movies in her day and she thinks i may be a vampire
but the point is that placating such people requires an effort that i'm simply unwilling to make and those cute little freshmen making eyes at me and paying me idiotic compliments
i've grown up anthony
marietta itself offered little social life
half a dozen farmestates formed a hectagon around it but these belonged to ancient men who displayed themselves only as inert graythatched lumps in the back of limousines on their way to the station whither they were sometimes accompanied by equally ancient and doubly massive wives
the townspeople were a particularly uninteresting typeunmarried females were predominant for the most partwith schoolfestival horizons and souls bleak as the forbidding white architecture of the three churches
the only native with whom they came into close contact was the broadhipped broadshouldered swedish girl who came every day to do their work
she was silent and efficient and gloria after finding her weeping violently into her bowed arms upon the kitchen table developed an uncanny fear of her and stopped complaining about the food
because of her untold and esoteric grief the girl stayed on
gloria's penchant for premonitions and her bursts of vague supernaturalism were a surprise to anthony
either some complex properly and scientifically inhibited in the early years with her bilphistic mother or some inherited hypersensitiveness made her susceptible to any suggestion of the psychic and far from gullible about the motives of people she was inclined to credit any extraordinary happening attributed to the whimsical perambulations of the buried
the desperate squeakings about the old house on windy nights that to anthony were burglars with revolvers ready in hand represented to gloria the auras evil and restive of dead generations expiating the inexpiable upon the ancient and romantic hearth
one night because of two swift bangs downstairs which anthony fearfully but unavailingly investigated they lay awake nearly until dawn asking each other examinationpaper questions about the history of the world
in october muriel came out for a two weeks' visit
gloria had called her on longdistance and miss kane ended the conversation characteristically by saying allllll righty
i'll be there with bells
she arrived with a dozen popular songs under her arm
you ought to have a phonograph out here in the country she said just a little victhey don't cost much
then whenever you're lonesome you can have caruso or al jolson right at your door
she worried anthony to distraction by telling him that he was the first clever man she had ever known and she got so tired of shallow people
he wondered that people fell in love with such women
yet he supposed that under a certain impassioned glance even she might take on a softness and promise
but gloria violently showing off her love for anthony was diverted into a state of purring content
finally richard caramel arrived for a garrulous and to gloria painfully literary weekend during which he discussed himself with anthony long after she lay in childlike sleep upstairs
it's been mighty funny this success and all said dick
just before the novel appeared i'd been trying without success to sell some short stories
then after my book came out i polished up three and had them accepted by one of the magazines that had rejected them before
i've done a lot of them since publishers don't pay me for my book till this winter
don't let the victor belong to the spoils
you mean write trash
he considered
if you mean deliberately injecting a slushy fadeout into each one i'm not
but i don't suppose i'm being so careful
i'm certainly writing faster and i don't seem to be thinking as much as i used to
perhaps it's because i don't get any conversation now that you're married and maury's gone to philadelphia
haven't the old urge and ambition
early success and all that
doesn't it worry you
frantically
i get a thing i call sentencefever that must be like buckfeverit's a sort of intense literary selfconsciousness that comes when i try to force myself
but the really awful days aren't when i think i can't write
they're when i wonder whether any writing is worth while at alli mean whether i'm not a sort of glorified buffoon
i like to hear you talk that way said anthony with a touch of his old patronizing insolence
i was afraid you'd gotten a bit idiotic over your work
read the damnedest interview you gave out  dick interrupted with an agonized expression
good lord
don't mention it
young lady wrote itmost admiring young lady
kept telling me my work was 'strong' and i sort of lost my head and made a lot of strange pronouncements
some of it was good though don't you think
oh yes that part about the wise writer writing for the youth of his generation the critic of the next and the schoolmaster of ever afterward
oh i believe a lot of it admitted richard caramel with a faint beam
it simply was a mistake to give it out
in november they moved into anthony's apartment from which they sallied triumphantly to the yaleharvard and harvardprinceton football games to the st nicholas iceskating rink to a thorough round of the theatres and to a miscellany of entertainmentsfrom small staid dances to the great affairs that gloria loved held in those few houses where lackeys with powdered wigs scurried around in magnificent anglomania under the direction of gigantic majordomos
their intention was to go abroad the first of the year or at any rate when the war was over
anthony had actually completed a chestertonian essay on the twelfth century by way of introduction to his proposed book and gloria had done some extensive research work on the question of russian sable coatsin fact the winter was approaching quite comfortably when the bilphistic demiurge decided suddenly in middecember that mrs gilbert's soul had aged sufficiently in its present incarnation
in consequence anthony took a miserable and hysterical gloria out to kansas city where in the fashion of mankind they paid the terrible and mindshaking deference to the dead
mr gilbert became for the first and last time in his life a truly pathetic figure
that woman he had broken to wait upon his body and play congregation to his mind had ironically deserted himjust when he could not much longer have supported her
never again would he be able so satisfactorily to bore and bully a human soul
chapter ii   symposium  gloria had lulled anthony's mind to sleep
she who seemed of all women the wisest and the finest hung like a brilliant curtain across his doorways shutting out the light of the sun
in those first years what he believed bore invariably the stamp of gloria he saw the sun always through the pattern of the curtain
it was a sort of lassitude that brought them back to marietta for another summer
through a golden enervating spring they had loitered restive and lazily extravagant along the california coast joining other parties intermittently and drifting from pasadena to coronado from coronado to santa barbara with no purpose more apparent than gloria's desire to dance by different music or catch some infinitesimal variant among the changing colors of the sea
out of the pacific there rose to greet them savage rocklands and equally barbaric hostelries built that at teatime one might drowse into a languid wicker bazaar glorified by the polo costumes of southhampton and lake forest and newport and palm beach
and as the waves met and splashed and glittered in the most placid of the bays so they joined this group and that and with them shifted stations murmuring ever of those strange unsubstantial gaieties in wait just over the next green and fruitful valley
a simple healthy leisure class it wasthe best of the men not unpleasantly undergraduatethey seemed to be on a perpetual candidates list for some etherealized porcellian or skull and bones extended out indefinitely into the world the women of more than average beauty fragilely athletic somewhat idiotic as hostesses but charming and infinitely decorative as guests
sedately and gracefully they danced the steps of their selection in the balmy tea hours accomplishing with a certain dignity the movements so horribly burlesqued by clerk and chorus girl the country over
it seemed ironic that in this lone and discredited offspring of the arts americans should excel unquestionably
having danced and splashed through a lavish spring anthony and gloria found that they had spent too much money and for this must go into retirement for a certain period
there was anthony's work they said
almost before they knew it they were back in the gray house more aware now that other lovers had slept there other names had been called over the banisters other couples had sat upon the porch steps watching the graygreen fields and the black bulk of woods beyond
it was the same anthony more restless inclined to quicken only under the stimulus of several highballs faintly almost imperceptibly apathetic toward gloria
but gloriashe would be twentyfour in august and was in an attractive but sincere panic about it
six years to thirty
had she been less in love with anthony her sense of the flight of time would have expressed itself in a reawakened interest in other men in a deliberate intention of extracting a transient gleam of romance from every potential lover who glanced at her with lowered brows over a shining dinner table
she said to anthony one day  how i feel is that if i wanted anything i'd take it
that's what i've always thought all my life
but it happens that i want you and so i just haven't room for any other desires
they were bound eastward through a parched and lifeless indiana and she had looked up from one of her beloved moving picture magazines to find a casual conversation suddenly turned grave
anthony frowned out the car window
as the track crossed a country road a farmer appeared momentarily in his wagon he was chewing on a straw and was apparently the same farmer they had passed a dozen times before sitting in silent and malignant symbolism
as anthony turned to gloria his frown intensified
you worry me he objected i can imagine wanting another woman under certain transitory circumstances but i can't imagine taking her
but i don't feel that way anthony
i can't be bothered resisting things i want
my way is not to want themto want nobody but you
yet when i think that if you just happened to take a fancy to some one  oh don't be an idiot
she exclaimed
there'd be nothing casual about it
and i can't even imagine the possibility
this emphatically closed the conversation
anthony's unfailing appreciation made her happier in his company than in any one's else
she definitely enjoyed himshe loved him
so the summer began very much as had the one before
there was however one radical change in mnage
the icyhearted scandinavian whose austere cooking and sardonic manner of waiting on table had so depressed gloria gave way to an exceedingly efficient japanese whose name was tanalahaka but who confessed that he heeded any summons which included the dissyllable tana
tana was unusually small even for a japanese and displayed a somewhat nave conception of himself as a man of the world
on the day of his arrival from r gugimoniki japanese reliable employment agency he called anthony into his room to see the treasures of his trunk
these included a large collection of japanese post cards which he was all for explaining to his employer at once individually and at great length
among them were half a dozen of pornographic intent and plainly of american origin though the makers had modestly omitted both their names and the form for mailing
he next brought out some of his own handiworka pair of american pants which he had made himself and two suits of solid silk underwear
he informed anthony confidentially as to the purpose for which these latter were reserved
the next exhibit was a rather good copy of an etching of abraham lincoln to whose face he had given an unmistakable japanese cast
last came a flute he had made it himself but it was broken he was going to fix it soon
after these polite formalities which anthony conjectured must be native to japan tana delivered a long harangue in splintered english on the relation of master and servant from which anthony gathered that he had worked on large estates but had always quarrelled with the other servants because they were not honest
they had a great time over the word honest and in fact became rather irritated with each other because anthony persisted stubbornly that tana was trying to say hornets and even went to the extent of buzzing in the manner of a bee and flapping his arms to imitate wings
after threequarters of an hour anthony was released with the warm assurance that they would have other nice chats in which tana would tell how we do in my countree
such was tana's garrulous premire in the gray houseand he fulfilled its promise
though he was conscientious and honorable he was unquestionably a terrific bore
he seemed unable to control his tongue sometimes continuing from paragraph to paragraph with a look akin to pain in his small brown eyes
sunday and monday afternoons he read the comic sections of the newspapers
one cartoon which contained a facetious japanese butler diverted him enormously though he claimed that the protagonist who to anthony appeared clearly oriental had really an american face
the difficulty with the funny paper was that when aided by anthony he had spelled out the last three pictures and assimilated their context with a concentration surely adequate for kant's critique he had entirely forgotten what the first pictures were about
in the middle of june anthony and gloria celebrated their first anniversary by having a date
anthony knocked at the door and she ran to let him in
then they sat together on the couch calling over those names they had made for each other new combinations of endearments ages old
yet to this date was appended no attenuated goodnight with its ecstasy of regret
later in june horror leered out at gloria struck at her and frightened her bright soul back half a generation
then slowly it faded out faded back into that impenetrable darkness whence it had cometaking relentlessly its modicum of youth
with an infallible sense of the dramatic it chose a little railroad station in a wretched village near portchester
the station platform lay all day bare as a prairie exposed to the dusty yellow sun and to the glance of that most obnoxious type of countryman who lives near a metropolis and has attained its cheap smartness without its urbanity
a dozen of these yokels redeyed cheerless as scarecrows saw the incident
dimly it passed across their confused and uncomprehending minds taken at its broadest for a coarse joke at its subtlest for a shame
meanwhile there upon the platform a measure of brightness faded from the world
with eric merriam anthony had been sitting over a decanter of scotch all the hot summer afternoon while gloria and constance merriam swam and sunned themselves at the beach club the latter under a striped parasolawning gloria stretched sensuously upon the soft hot sand tanning her inevitable legs
later they had all four played with inconsequential sandwiches then gloria had risen tapping anthony's knee with her parasol to get his attention
we've got to go dear
now
he looked at her unwillingly
at that moment nothing seemed of more importance than to idle on that shady porch drinking mellowed scotch while his host reminisced interminably on the byplay of some forgotten political campaign
we've really got to go repeated gloria
we can get a taxi to the station come on anthony
she commanded a bit more imperiously
now see here merriam his yarn cut off made conventional objections meanwhile provocatively filling his guest's glass with a highball that should have been sipped through ten minutes
but at gloria's annoyed we really must anthony drank it off got to his feet and made an elaborate bow to his hostess
it seems we 'must' he said with little grace
in a minute he was following gloria down a gardenwalk between tall rosebushes her parasol brushing gently the juneblooming leaves
most inconsiderate he thought as they reached the road
he felt with injured navete that gloria should not have interrupted such innocent and harmless enjoyment
the whiskey had both soothed and clarified the restless things in his mind
it occurred to him that she had taken this same attitude several times before
was he always to retreat from pleasant episodes at a touch of her parasol or a flicker of her eye
his unwillingness blurred to ill will which rose within him like a resistless bubble
he kept silent perversely inhibiting a desire to reproach her
they found a taxi in front of the inn rode silently to the little station  then anthony knew what he wantedto assert his will against this cool and impervious girl to obtain with one magnificent effort a mastery that seemed infinitely desirable
let's go over to see the barneses he said without looking at her
i don't feel like going home
mrs barnes ne rachael jerryl had a summer place several miles from redgate
we went there day before yesterday she answered shortly
i'm sure they'd be glad to see us
he felt that that was not a strong enough note braced himself stubbornly and added i want to see the barneses
i haven't any desire to go home
well i haven't any desire to go to the barneses
suddenly they stared at each other
why anthony she said with annoyance this is sunday night and they probably have guests for supper
why we should go in at this hour  then why couldn't we have stayed at the merriams'
he burst out
why go home when we were having a perfectly decent time
they asked us to supper
they had to
give me the money and i'll get the railroad tickets
i certainly will not
i'm in no humour for a ride in that damn hot train
gloria stamped her foot on the platform
anthony you act as if you're tight
on the contrary i'm perfectly sober
but his voice had slipped into a husky key and she knew with certainty that this was untrue
if you're sober you'll give me the money for the tickets
but it was too late to talk to him that way
in his mind was but one ideathat gloria was being selfish that she was always being selfish and would continue to be unless here and now he asserted himself as her master
this was the occasion of all occasions since for a whim she had deprived him of a pleasure
his determination solidified approached momentarily a dull and sullen hate
i won't go in the train he said his voice trembling a little with anger
we're going to the barneses
i'm not
she cried
if you go i'm going home alone
go on then
without a word she turned toward the ticket office simultaneously he remembered that she had some money with her and that this was not the sort of victory he wanted the sort he must have
he took a step after her and seized her arm
see here
he muttered you're not going alone
i certainly amwhy anthony
this exclamation as she tried to pull away from him and he only tightened his grasp
he looked at her with narrowed and malicious eyes
let go
her cry had a quality of fierceness
if you have any decency you'll let go
why
he knew why
but he took a confused and not quite confident pride in holding her there
i'm going home do you understand
and you're going to let me go
no i'm not
her eyes were burning now
are you going to make a scene here
i say you're not going
i'm tired of your eternal selfishness
i only want to go home
two wrathful tears started from her eyes
this time you're going to do what i say
slowly her body straightened her head went back in a gesture of infinite scorn
i hate you
her low words were expelled like venom through her clenched teeth
oh let me go
oh i hate you
she tried to jerk herself away but he only grasped the other arm
i hate you
i hate you
at gloria's fury his uncertainty returned but he felt that now he had gone too far to give in
it seemed that he had always given in and that in her heart she had despised him for it
ah she might hate him now but afterward she would admire him for his dominance
the approaching train gave out a premonitory siren that tumbled melodramatically toward them down the glistening blue tracks
gloria tugged and strained to free herself and words older than the book of genesis came to her lips
oh you brute
she sobbed
oh you brute
oh i hate you
oh you brute
oh  on the station platform other prospective passengers were beginning to turn and stare the drone of the train was audible it increased to a clamor
gloria's efforts redoubled then ceased altogether and she stood there trembling and hoteyed at this helpless humiliation as the engine roared and thundered into the station
low below the flood of steam and the grinding of the brakes came her voice  oh if there was one man here you couldn't do this
you couldn't do this
you coward
you coward oh you coward
anthony silent trembling himself gripped her rigidly aware that faces dozens of them curiously unmoved shadows of a dream were regarding him
then the bells distilled metallic crashes that were like physical pain the smokestacks volleyed in slow acceleration at the sky and in a moment of noise and gray gaseous turbulence the line of faces ran by moved off became indistinctuntil suddenly there was only the sun slanting east across the tracks and a volume of sound decreasing far off like a train made out of tin thunder
he dropped her arms
he had won
now if he wished he might laugh
the test was done and he had sustained his will with violence
let leniency walk in the wake of victory
we'll hire a car here and drive back to marietta he said with fine reserve
for answer gloria seized his hand with both of hers and raising it to her mouth bit deeply into his thumb
he scarcely noticed the pain seeing the blood spurt he absentmindedly drew out his handkerchief and wrapped the wound
that too was part of the triumph he supposedit was inevitable that defeat should thus be resentedand as such was beneath notice
she was sobbing almost without tears profoundly and bitterly
i won't go
i won't go
youcan'tmakemego
you'veyou've killed any love i ever had for you and any respect
but all that's left in me would die before i'd move from this place
oh if i'd thought you'd lay your hands on me  you're going with me he said brutally if i have to carry you
he turned beckoned to a taxicab told the driver to go to marietta
the man dismounted and swung the door open
anthony faced his wife and said between his clenched teeth  will you get inor will i put you in
with a subdued cry of infinite pain and despair she yielded herself up and got into the car
all the long ride through the increasing dark of twilight she sat huddled in her side of the car her silence broken by an occasional dry and solitary sob
anthony stared out the window his mind working dully on the slowly changing significance of what had occurred
something was wrongthat last cry of gloria's had struck a chord which echoed posthumously and with incongruous disquiet in his heart
he must be rightyet she seemed such a pathetic little thing now broken and dispirited humiliated beyond the measure of her lot to bear
the sleeves of her dress were torn her parasol was gone forgotten on the platform
it was a new costume he remembered and she had been so proud of it that very morning when they had left the house
he began wondering if any one they knew had seen the incident
and persistently there recurred to him her cry  all that's left in me would die  this gave him a confused and increasing worry
it fitted so well with the gloria who lay in the cornerno longer a proud gloria nor any gloria he had known
he asked himself if it were possible
while he did not believe she would cease to love himthis of course was unthinkableit was yet problematical whether gloria without her arrogance her independence her virginal confidence and courage would be the girl of his glory the radiant woman who was precious and charming because she was ineffably triumphantly herself
he was very drunk even then so drunk as not to realize his own drunkenness
when they reached the gray house he went to his own room and his mind still wrestling helplessly and sombrely with what he had done fell into a deep stupor on his bed
it was after one o'clock and the hall seemed extraordinarily quiet when gloria wideeyed and sleepless traversed it and pushed open the door of his room
he had been too befuddled to open the windows and the air was stale and thick with whiskey
she stood for a moment by his bed a slender exquisitely graceful figure in her boyish silk pajamasthen with abandon she flung herself upon him half waking him in the frantic emotion of her embrace dropping her warm tears upon his throat
oh anthony
she cried passionately oh my darling you don't know what you did
yet in the morning coming early into her room he knelt down by her bed and cried like a little boy as though it was his heart that had been broken
it seemed last night she said gravely her fingers playing in his hair that all the part of me you loved the part that was worth knowing all the pride and fire was gone
i knew that what was left of me would always love you but never in quite the same way
nevertheless she was aware even then that she would forget in time and that it is the manner of life seldom to strike but always to wear away
after that morning the incident was never mentioned and its deep wound healed with anthony's handand if there was triumph some darker force than theirs possessed it possessed the knowledge and the victory
nietzschean incident  gloria's independence like all sincere and profound qualities had begun unconsciously but once brought to her attention by anthony's fascinated discovery of it it assumed more nearly the proportions of a formal code
from her conversation it might be assumed that all her energy and vitality went into a violent affirmation of the negative principle never give a damn
not for anything or anybody she said except myself and by implication for anthony
that's the rule of all life and if it weren't i'd be that way anyhow
nobody'd do anything for me if it didn't gratify them to and i'd do as little for them
she was on the front porch of the nicest lady in marietta when she said this and as she finished she gave a curious little cry and sank in a dead faint to the porch floor
the lady brought her to and drove her home in her car
it had occurred to the estimable gloria that she was probably with child
she lay upon the long lounge downstairs
day was slipping warmly out the window touching the late roses on the porch pillars
all i think of ever is that i love you she wailed
i value my body because you think it's beautiful
and this body of mineof yoursto have it grow ugly and shapeless
it's simply intolerable
oh anthony i'm not afraid of the pain
he consoled her desperatelybut in vain
she continued  and then afterward i might have wide hips and be pale with all my freshness gone and no radiance in my hair
he paced the floor with his hands in his pockets asking  is it certain
i don't know anything
i've always hated obstrics or whatever you call them
i thought i'd have a child some time
but not now
well for god's sake don't lie there and go to pieces
her sobs lapsed
she drew down a merciful silence from the twilight which filled the room
turn on the lights she pleaded
these days seem so shortjune seemedtohavelonger days when i was a little girl
the lights snapped on and it was as though blue drapes of softest silk had been dropped behind the windows and the door
her pallor her immobility without grief now or joy awoke his sympathy
do you want me to have it
she asked listlessly
i'm indifferent
that is i'm neutral
if you have it i'll probably be glad
if you don'twell that's all right too
i wish you'd make up your mind one way or the other
suppose you make up your mind
she looked at him contemptuously scorning to answer
you'd think you'd been singled out of all the women in the world for this crowning indignity
what if i do
she cried angrily
it isn't an indignity for them
it's their one excuse for living
it's the one thing they're good for
it is an indignity for me  see here gloria i'm with you whatever you do but for god's sake be a sport about it
oh don't fuss at me
she wailed
they exchanged a mute look of no particular significance but of much stress
then anthony took a book from the shelf and dropped into a chair
half an hour later her voice came out of the intense stillness that pervaded the room and hung like incense on the air
i'll drive over and see constance merriam tomorrow
all right
and i'll go to tarrytown and see grampa
you see she added it isn't that i'm afraidof this or anything else
i'm being true to me you know
i know he agreed
the practical men  adam patch in a pious rage against the germans subsisted on the war news
pin maps plastered his walls atlases were piled deep on tables convenient to his hand together with photographic histories of the world war official explainalls and the personal impressions of war correspondents and of privates x y and z
several times during anthony's visit his grandfather's secretary edward shuttleworth the onetime accomplished ginphysician of pat's place in hoboken now shod with righteous indignation would appear with an extra
the old man attacked each paper with untiring fury tearing out those columns which appeared to him of sufficient pregnancy for preservation and thrusting them into one of his already bulging files
well what have you been doing
he asked anthony blandly
nothing
well i thought so
i've been intending to drive over and see you all summer
i've been writing
don't you remember the essay i sent youthe one i sold to the florentine last winter
essay
you never sent me any essay
oh yes i did
we talked about it
adam patch shook his head mildly
oh no
you never sent me any essay
you may have thought you sent it but it never reached me
why you read it grampa insisted anthony somewhat exasperated you read it and disagreed with it
the old man suddenly remembered but this was made apparent only by a partial falling open of his mouth displaying rows of gray gums
eying anthony with a green and ancient stare he hesitated between confessing his error and covering it up
so you're writing he said quickly
well why don't you go over and write about these germans
write something real something about what's going on something people can read
anybody can't be a war correspondent objected anthony
you have to have some newspaper willing to buy your stuff
and i can't spare the money to go over as a freelance
i'll send you over suggested his grandfather surprisingly
i'll get you over as an authorized correspondent of any newspaper you pick out
anthony recoiled from the ideaalmost simultaneously he bounded toward it
idon'tknow  he would have to leave gloria whose whole life yearned toward him and enfolded him
gloria was in trouble
oh the thing wasn't feasibleyethe saw himself in khaki leaning as all war correspondents lean upon a heavy stick portfolio at shouldertrying to look like an englishman
i'd like to think it over he confessed
it's certainly very kind of you
i'll think it over and i'll let you know
thinking it over absorbed him on the journey to new york
he had had one of those sudden flashes of illumination vouchsafed to all men who are dominated by a strong and beloved woman which show them a world of harder men more fiercely trained and grappling with the abstractions of thought and war
in that world the arms of gloria would exist only as the hot embrace of a chance mistress coolly sought and quickly forgotten
these unfamiliar phantoms were crowding closely about him when he boarded his train for marietta in the grand central station
the car was crowded he secured the last vacant seat and it was only after several minutes that he gave even a casual glance to the man beside him
when he did he saw a heavy lay of jaw and nose a curved chin and small puffedunder eyes
in a moment he recognized joseph bloeckman
simultaneously they both half rose were half embarrassed and exchanged what amounted to a half handshake
then as though to complete the matter they both half laughed
well remarked anthony without inspiration i haven't seen you for a long time
immediately he regretted his words and started to add i didn't know you lived out this way
but bloeckman anticipated him by asking pleasantly  how's your wife
  she's very well
how've you been
excellent
his tone amplified the grandeur of the word
it seemed to anthony that during the last year bloeckman had grown tremendously in dignity
the boiled look was gone he seemed done at last
in addition he was no longer overdressed
the inappropriate facetiousness he had affected in ties had given way to a sturdy dark pattern and his right hand which had formerly displayed two heavy rings was now innocent of ornament and even without the raw glow of a manicure
this dignity appeared also in his personality
the last aura of the successful travellingman had faded from him that deliberate ingratiation of which the lowest form is the bawdy joke in the pullman smoker
one imagined that having been fawned upon financially he had attained aloofness having been snubbed socially he had acquired reticence
but whatever had given him weight instead of bulk anthony no longer felt a correct superiority in his presence
d'you remember caramel richard caramel
i believe you met him one night
i remember
he was writing a book
well he sold it to the movies
then they had some scenario man named jordan work on it
well dick subscribes to a clipping bureau and he's furious because about half the movie reviewers speak of the 'power and strength of william jordan's demon lover'
didn't mention old dick at all
you'd think this fellow jordan had actually conceived and developed the thing
bloeckman nodded comprehensively
most of the contracts state that the original writer's name goes into all the paid publicity
is caramel still writing
oh yes
writing hard
short stories
well that's fine that's fine you on this train often
about once a week
we live in marietta
is that so
well well
i live near cos cob myself
bought a place there only recently
we're only five miles apart
you'll have to come and see us
anthony was surprised at his own courtesy
i'm sure gloria'd be delighted to see an old friend
anybody'll tell you where the house isit's our second season there
thank you
then as though returning a complementary politeness how is your grandfather
he's been well
i had lunch with him today
a great character said bloeckman severely
a fine example of an american
the triumph of lethargy  anthony found his wife deep in the porch hammock voluptuously engaged with a lemonade and a tomato sandwich and carrying on an apparently cheery conversation with tana upon one of tana's complicated themes
in my countree anthony recognized his invariable preface all timepeopleseat ricebecause haven't got
cannot eat what no have got
had his nationality not been desperately apparent one would have thought he had acquired his knowledge of his native land from american primaryschool geographies
when the oriental had been squelched and dismissed to the kitchen anthony turned questioningly to gloria  it's all right she announced smiling broadly
and it surprised me more than it does you
there's no doubt
none
couldn't be
they rejoiced happily gay again with reborn irresponsibility
then he told her of his opportunity to go abroad and that he was almost ashamed to reject it
what do you think
just tell me frankly
why anthony
her eyes were startled
do you want to go
without me
his face fellyet he knew with his wife's question that it was too late
her arms sweet and strangling were around him for he had made all such choices back in that room in the plaza the year before
this was an anachronism from an age of such dreams
gloria he lied in a great burst of comprehension of course i don't
i was thinking you might go as a nurse or something
he wondered dully if his grandfather would consider this
as she smiled he realized again how beautiful she was a gorgeous girl of miraculous freshness and sheerly honorable eyes
she embraced his suggestion with luxurious intensity holding it aloft like a sun of her own making and basking in its beams
she strung together an amazing synopsis for an extravaganza of martial adventure
after supper surfeited with the subject she yawned
she wanted not to talk but only to read penrod stretched upon the lounge until at midnight she fell asleep
but anthony after he had carried her romantically up the stairs stayed awake to brood upon the day vaguely angry with her vaguely dissatisfied
what am i going to do
he began at breakfast
here we've been married a year and we've just worried around without even being efficient people of leisure
yes you ought to do something she admitted being in an agreeable and loquacious humor
this was not the first of these discussions but as they usually developed anthony in the rle of protagonist she had come to avoid them
it's not that i have any moral compunctions about work he continued but grampa may die tomorrow and he may live for ten years
meanwhile we're living above our income and all we've got to show for it is a farmer's car and a few clothes
we keep an apartment that we've only lived in three months and a little old house way off in nowhere
we're frequently bored and yet we won't make any effort to know any one except the same crowd who drift around california all summer wearing sport clothes and waiting for their families to die
how you've changed
remarked gloria
once you told me you didn't see why an american couldn't loaf gracefully
well damn it i wasn't married
and the old mind was working at top speed and now it's going round and round like a cogwheel with nothing to catch it
as a matter of fact i think that if i hadn't met you i would have done something
but you make leisure so subtly attractive  oh it's all my fault  i didn't mean that and you know i didn't
but here i'm almost twentyseven and  oh she interrupted in vexation you make me tired
talking as though i were objecting or hindering you
i was just discussing it gloria
can't i discuss  i should think you'd be strong enough to settle  something with you without  your own problems without coming to me
you talk a lot about going to work
i could use more money very easily but i'm not complaining
whether you work or not i love you
her last words were gentle as fine snow upon hard ground
but for the moment neither was attending to the otherthey were each engaged in polishing and perfecting his own attitude
i have workedsome
this by anthony was an imprudent bringing up of raw reserves
gloria laughed torn between delight and derision she resented his sophistry as at the same time she admired his nonchalance
she would never blame him for being the ineffectual idler so long as he did it sincerely from the attitude that nothing much was worth doing
work
she scoffed
oh you sad bird
you bluffer
workthat means a great arranging of the desk and the lights a great sharpening of pencils and 'gloria don't sing'
and 'please keep that damn tana away from me' and 'let me read you my opening sentence' and 'i won't be through for a long time gloria so don't stay up for me' and a tremendous consumption of tea or coffee
and that's all
in just about an hour i hear the old pencil stop scratching and look over
you've got out a book and you're 'looking up' something
then you're reading
then yawnsthen bed and a great tossing about because you're all full of caffeine and can't sleep
two weeks later the whole performance over again
with much difficulty anthony retained a scanty breechclout of dignity
now that's a slight exaggeration
you know darn well i sold an essay to the florentineand it attracted a lot of attention considering the circulation of the florentine
and what's more gloria you know i sat up till five o'clock in the morning finishing it
she lapsed into silence giving him rope
and if he had not hanged himself he had certainly come to the end of it
at least he concluded feebly i'm perfectly willing to be a war correspondent
but so was gloria
they were both willinganxious they assured each other of it
the evening ended on a note of tremendous sentiment the majesty of leisure the ill health of adam patch love at any cost
anthony
she called over the banister one afternoon a week later there's some one at the door
anthony who had been lolling in the hammock on the sunspeckled south porch strolled around to the front of the house
a foreign car large and impressive crouched like an immense and saturnine bug at the foot of the path
a man in a soft pongee suit with cap to match hailed him
hello there patch
ran over to call on you
it was bloeckman as always infinitesimally improved of subtler intonation of more convincing ease
i'm awfully glad you did
anthony raised his voice to a vinecovered window gloria
we've got a visitor
i'm in the tub wailed gloria politely
with a smile the two men acknowledged the triumph of her alibi
she'll be down
come round here on the sideporch
like a drink
gloria's always in the tubgood third of every day
pity she doesn't live on the sound
can't afford it
as coming from adam patch's grandson bloeckman took this as a form of pleasantry
after fifteen minutes filled with estimable brilliancies gloria appeared fresh in starched yellow bringing atmosphere and an increase of vitality
i want to be a successful sensation in the movies she announced
i hear that mary pickford makes a million dollars annually
you could you know said bloeckman
i think you'd film very well
would you let me anthony
if i only play unsophisticated rles
as the conversation continued in stilted commas anthony wondered that to him and bloeckman both this girl had once been the most stimulating the most tonic personality they had ever knownand now the three sat like overoiled machines without conflict without fear without elation heavily enamelled little figures secure beyond enjoyment in a world where death and war dull emotion and noble savagery were covering a continent with the smoke of terror
in a moment he would call tana and they would pour into themselves a gay and delicate poison which would restore them momentarily to the pleasurable excitement of childhood when every face in a crowd had carried its suggestion of splendid and significant transactions taking place somewhere to some magnificent and illimitable purpose life was no more than this summer afternoon a faint wind stirring the lace collar of gloria's dress the slow baking drowsiness of the veranda intolerably unmoved they all seemed removed from any romantic imminency of action
even gloria's beauty needed wild emotions needed poignancy needed death   any day next week bloeckman was saying to gloria
heretake this card
what they do is to give you a test of about three hundred feet of film and they can tell pretty accurately from that
how about wednesday
wednesday's fine
just phone me and i'll go around with you  he was on his feet shaking hands brisklythen his car was a wraith of dust down the road
anthony turned to his wife in bewilderment
why gloria
you don't mind if i have a trial anthony
just a trial
i've got to go to town wednesday anyhow
but it's so silly
you don't want to go into the moviesmoon around a studio all day with a lot of cheap chorus people
lot of mooning around mary pickford does
everybody isn't a mary pickford
well i can't see how you'd object to my trying
i do though
i hate actors
oh you make me tired
do you imagine i have a very thrilling time dozing on this damn porch
you wouldn't mind if you loved me
of course i love you she said impatiently making out a quick case for herself
it's just because i do that i hate to see you go to pieces by just lying around and saying you ought to work
perhaps if i did go into this for a while it'd stir you up so you'd do something
it's just your craving for excitement that's all it is
maybe it is
it's a perfectly natural craving isn't it
well i'll tell you one thing
if you go to the movies i'm going to europe
well go on then
i'm not stopping you
to show she was not stopping him she melted into melancholy tears
together they marshalled the armies of sentimentwords kisses endearments selfreproaches
they attained nothing
inevitably they attained nothing
finally in a burst of gargantuan emotion each of them sat down and wrote a letter
anthony's was to his grandfather gloria's was to joseph bloeckman
it was a triumph of lethargy
one day early in july anthony returned from an afternoon in new york called upstairs to gloria
receiving no answer he guessed she was asleep and so went into the pantry for one of the little sandwiches that were always prepared for them
he found tana seated at the kitchen table before a miscellaneous assortment of odds and endscigarboxes knives pencils the tops of cans and some scraps of paper covered with elaborate figures and diagrams
what the devil you doing
demanded anthony curiously
tana politely grinned
i show you he exclaimed enthusiastically
i tell  you making a doghouse
no sa
tana grinned again
make typewutta
typewriter
yes sa
i think oh all time i think lie in bed think 'bout typewutta
so you thought you'd make one eh
wait
i tell
anthony munching a sandwich leaned leisurely against the sink
tana opened and closed his mouth several times as though testing its capacity for action
then with a rush he began  i been thinktypewuttahas oh many many many many thing

tana laughed disparagingly

he pointed to the miscellany of junk on the table
i mean mrs

tana reassured him
she be back five o'clock she say
down in the village
no
went off before lunch
she go mr
bloeckman
anthony started
went out with mr
bloeckman
she be back five
without a word anthony left the kitchen with tana's disconsolate i tell trailing after him
so this was gloria's idea of excitement by god
his fists were clenched within a moment he had worked himself up to a tremendous pitch of indignation
he went to the door and looked out there was no car in sight and his watch stood at four minutes of five
with furious energy he dashed down to the end of the pathas far as the bend of the road a mile off he could see no carexceptbut it was a farmer's flivver
then in an undignified pursuit of dignity he rushed back to the shelter of the house as quickly as he had rushed out
pacing up and down the living room he began an angry rehearsal of the speech he would make to her when she came in  so this is love
he would beginor no it sounded too much like the popular phrase so this is paris
he must be dignified hurt grieved
anyhowso this is what you do when i have to go up and trot all day around the hot city on business
no wonder i can't write
no wonder i don't dare let you out of my sight
he was expanding now warming to his subject
i'll tell you he continued i'll tell you he paused catching a familiar ring in the wordsthen he realizedit was tana's i tell
yet anthony neither laughed nor seemed absurd to himself
to his frantic imagination it was already sixseveneight and she was never coming
bloeckman finding her bored and unhappy had persuaded her to go to california with him  there was a great todo out in front a joyous yoho anthony
and he rose trembling weakly happy to see her fluttering up the path
bloeckman was following cap in hand
dearest
she cried
we've been for the best jauntall over new york state
i'll have to be starting home said bloeckman almost immediately
wish you'd both been here when i came
i'm sorry i wasn't answered anthony dryly
when he had departed anthony hesitated
the fear was gone from his heart yet he felt that some protest was ethically apropos
gloria resolved his uncertainty
i knew you wouldn't mind
he came just before lunch and said he had to go to garrison on business and wouldn't i go with him
he looked so lonesome anthony
and i drove his car all the way
listlessly anthony dropped into a chair his mind tiredtired with nothing tired with everything with the world's weight he had never chosen to bear
he was ineffectual and vaguely helpless here as he had always been
one of those personalities who in spite of all their words are inarticulate he seemed to have inherited only the vast tradition of human failurethat and the sense of death
i suppose i don't care he answered
one must be broad about these things and gloria being young being beautiful must have reasonable privileges
yet it wearied him that he failed to understand
winter  she rolled over on her back and lay still for a moment in the great bed watching the february sun suffer one last attenuated refinement in its passage through the leaded panes into the room
for a time she had no accurate sense of her whereabouts or of the events of the day before or the day before that then like a suspended pendulum memory began to beat out its story releasing with each swing a burdened quota of time until her life was given back to her
she could hear now anthony's troubled breathing beside her she could smell whiskey and cigarette smoke
she noticed that she lacked complete muscular control when she moved it was not a sinuous motion with the resultant strain distributed easily over her bodyit was a tremendous effort of her nervous system as though each time she were hypnotizing herself into performing an impossible action  she was in the bathroom brushing her teeth to get rid of that intolerable taste then back by the bedside listening to the rattle of bounds's key in the outer door
wake up anthony
she said sharply
she climbed into bed beside him and closed her eyes
almost the last thing she remembered was a conversation with mr and mrs lacy
mrs lacy had said sure you don't want us to get you a taxi
and anthony had replied that he guessed they could walk over to fifth all right
then they had both attempted imprudently to bowand collapsed absurdly into a battalion of empty milk bottles just outside the door
there must have been two dozen milk bottles standing openmouthed in the dark
she could conceive of no plausible explanation of those milk bottles
perhaps they had been attracted by the singing in the lacy house and had hurried over agape with wonder to see the fun
well they'd had the worst of itthough it seemed that she and anthony never would get up the perverse things rolled so
still they had found a taxi
my meter's broken and it'll cost you a dollar and a half to get home said the taxi driver
well said anthony i'm young packy mcfarland and if you'll come down here i'll beat you till you can't stand up
at that point the man had driven off without them
they must have found another taxi for they were in the apartment  what time is it
anthony was sitting up in bed staring at her with owlish precision
this was obviously a rhetorical question
gloria could think of no reason why she should be expected to know the time
golly i feel like the devil
muttered anthony dispassionately
relaxing he tumbled back upon his pillow
bring on your grim reaper
anthony how'd we finally get home last night
taxi
oh
then after a pause did you put me to bed
i don't know
seems to me you put me to bed
what day is it
tuesday
tuesday
i hope so
if it's wednesday i've got to start work at that idiotic place
supposed to be down at nine or some such ungodly hour
ask bounds suggested gloria feebly
bounds
he called
sprightly sobera voice from a world that it seemed in the past two days they had left forever bounds sprang in short steps down the hall and appeared in the half darkness of the door
what day bounds
february the twentysecond i think sir
i mean day of the week
tuesday sir
thanks
after a pause are you ready for breakfast sir
yes and bounds before you get it will you make a pitcher of water and set it here beside the bed
i'm a little thirsty
yes sir
bounds retreated in sober dignity down the hallway
lincoln's birthday affirmed anthony without enthusiasm or st valentine's or somebody's
when did we start on this insane party
sunday night
after prayers
he suggested sardonically
we raced all over town in those hansoms and maury sat up with his driver don't you remember
then we came home and he tried to cook some baconcame out of the pantry with a few blackened remains insisting it was 'fried to the proverbial crisp'
both of them laughed spontaneously but with some difficulty and lying there side by side reviewed the chain of events that had ended in this rusty and chaotic dawn
they had been in new york for almost four months since the country had grown too cool in late october
they had given up california this year partly because of lack of funds partly with the idea of going abroad should this interminable war persisting now into its second year end during the winter
of late their income had lost elasticity no longer did it stretch to cover gay whims and pleasant extravagances and anthony had spent many puzzled and unsatisfactory hours over a densely figured pad making remarkable budgets that left huge margins for amusements trips etc and trying to apportion even approximately their past expenditures
he remembered a time when in going on a party with his two best friends he and maury had invariably paid more than their share of the expenses
they would buy the tickets for the theatre or squabble between themselves for the dinner check
it had seemed fitting dick with his navet and his astonishing fund of information about himself had been a diverting almost juvenile figurecourt jester to their royalty
but this was no longer true
it was dick who always had money it was anthony who entertained within limitationsalways excepting occasional wild wineinspired checkcashing partiesand it was anthony who was solemn about it next morning and told the scornful and disgusted gloria that they'd have to be more careful next time
in the two years since the publication of the demon lover dick had made over twentyfive thousand dollars most of it lately when the reward of the author of fiction had begun to swell unprecedentedly as a result of the voracious hunger of the motion pictures for plots
he received seven hundred dollars for every story at that time a large emolument for such a young manhe was not quite thirtyand for every one that contained enough action kissing shooting and sacrificing for the movies he obtained an additional thousand
his stories varied there was a measure of vitality and a sort of instinctive in all of them but none attained the personality of the demon lover and there were several that anthony considered downright cheap
these dick explained severely were to widen his audience
wasn't it true that men who had attained real permanence from shakespeare to mark twain had appealed to the many as well as to the elect
though anthony and maury disagreed gloria told him to go ahead and make as much money as he couldthat was the only thing that counted anyhow  maury a little stouter faintly mellower and more complaisant had gone to work in philadelphia
he came to new york once or twice a month and on such occasions the four of them travelled the popular routes from dinner to the theatre thence to the frolic or perhaps at the urging of the evercurious gloria to one of the cellars of greenwich village notorious through the furious but shortlived vogue of the new poetry movement
in january after many monologues directed at his reticent wife anthony determined to get something to do for the winter at any rate
he wanted to please his grandfather and even in a measure to see how he liked it himself
he discovered during several tentative semisocial calls that employers were not interested in a young man who was only going to try it for a few months or so
as the grandson of adam patch he was received everywhere with marked courtesy but the old man was a back number nowthe heyday of his fame as first an oppressor and then an uplifter of the people had been during the twenty years preceding his retirement
anthony even found several of the younger men who were under the impression that adam patch had been dead for some years
eventually anthony went to his grandfather and asked his advice which turned out to be that he should enter the bond business as a salesman a tedious suggestion to anthony but one that in the end he determined to follow
sheer money in deft manipulation had fascinations under all circumstances while almost any side of manufacturing would be insufferably dull
he considered newspaper work but decided that the hours were not ordered for a married man
and he lingered over pleasant fancies of himself either as editor of a brilliant weekly of opinion an american mercure de france or as scintillant producer of satiric comedy and parisian musical revue
however the approaches to these latter guilds seemed to be guarded by professional secrets
men drifted into them by the devious highways of writing and acting
it was palpably impossible to get on a magazine unless you had been on one before
so in the end he entered by way of his grandfather's letter that sanctum americanum where sat the president of wilson hiemer and hardy at his cleared desk and issued therefrom employed
he was to begin work on the twentythird of february
in tribute to the momentous occasion this twoday revel had been planned since he said after he began working he'd have to get to bed early during the week
maury noble had arrived from philadelphia on a trip that had to do with seeing some man in wall street whom incidentally he failed to see and richard caramel had been half persuaded half tricked into joining them
they had condescended to a wet and fashionable wedding on monday afternoon and in the evening had occurred the dnouement gloria going beyond her accustomed limit of four precisely timed cocktails led them on as gay and joyous a bacchanal as they had ever known disclosing an astonishing knowledge of ballet steps and singing songs which she confessed had been taught her by her cook when she was innocent and seventeen
she repeated these by request at intervals throughout the evening with such frank conviviality that anthony far from being annoyed was gratified at this fresh source of entertainment
the occasion was memorable in other waysa long conversation between maury and a defunct crab which he was dragging around on the end of a string as to whether the crab was fully conversant with the applications of the binomial theorem and the aforementioned race in two hansom cabs with the sedate and impressive shadows of fifth avenue for audience ending in a labyrinthine escape into the darkness of central park
finally anthony and gloria had paid a call on some wild young married peoplethe lacysand collapsed in the empty milk bottles
morning nowtheirs to add up the checks cashed here and there in clubs stores restaurants
theirs to air the dank staleness of wine and cigarettes out of the tall blue front room to pick up the broken glass and brush at the stained fabric of chairs and sofas to give bounds suits and dresses for the cleaners finally to take their smothery halffeverish bodies and faded depressed spirits out into the chill air of february that life might go on and wilson hiemer and hardy obtain the services of a vigorous man at nine next morning
do you remember called anthony from the bathroom when maury got out at the corner of one hundred and tenth street and acted as a traffic cop beckoning cars forward and motioning them back
they must have thought he was a private detective
after each reminiscence they both laughed inordinately their overwrought nerves responding as acutely and janglingly to mirth as to depression
gloria at the mirror was wondering at the splendid color and freshness of her faceit seemed that she had never looked so well though her stomach hurt her and her head was aching furiously
the day passed slowly
anthony riding in a taxi to his broker's to borrow money on a bond found that he had only two dollars in his pocket
the fare would cost all of that but he felt that on this particular afternoon he could not have endured the subway
when the taximetre reached his limit he must get out and walk
with this his mind drifted off into one of its characteristic daydreams
in this dream he discovered that the metre was going too fastthe driver had dishonestly adjusted it
calmly he reached his destination and then nonchalantly handed the man what he justly owed him
the man showed fight but almost before his hands were up anthony had knocked him down with one terrific blow
and when he rose anthony quickly sidestepped and floored him definitely with a crack in the temple

he was in court now
the judge had fined him five dollars and he had no money
would the court take his check
ah but the court did not know him
well he could identify himself by having them call his apartment

they did so
yes it was mrs anthony patch speakingbut how did she know that this man was her husband
how could she know
let the police sergeant ask her if she remembered the milk bottles 
he leaned forward hurriedly and tapped at the glass
the taxi was only at brooklyn bridge but the metre showed a dollar and eighty cents and anthony would never have omitted the ten per cent tip
later in the afternoon he returned to the apartment
gloria had also been outshoppingand was asleep curled in a corner of the sofa with her purchase locked securely in her arms
her face was as untroubled as a little girl's and the bundle that she pressed tightly to her bosom was a child's doll a profound and infinitely healing balm to her disturbed and childish heart
destiny  it was with this party more especially with gloria's part in it that a decided change began to come over their way of living
the magnificent attitude of not giving a damn altered overnight from being a mere tenet of gloria's it became the entire solace and justification for what they chose to do and what consequence it brought
not to be sorry not to loose one cry of regret to live according to a clear code of honor toward each other and to seek the moment's happiness as fervently and persistently as possible
no one cares about us but ourselves anthony she said one day
it'd be ridiculous for me to go about pretending i felt any obligations toward the world and as for worrying what people think about me i simply don't that's all
since i was a little girl in dancingschool i've been criticised by the mothers of all the little girls who weren't as popular as i was and i've always looked on criticism as a sort of envious tribute
this was because of a party in the boul' mich' one night where constance merriam had seen her as one of a highly stimulated party of four
constance merriam as an old school friend had gone to the trouble of inviting her to lunch next day in order to inform her how terrible it was
i told her i couldn't see it gloria told anthony
eric merriam is a sort of sublimated percy wolcottyou remember that man in hot springs i told you abouthis idea of respecting constance is to leave her at home with her sewing and her baby and her book and such innocuous amusements whenever he's going on a party that promises to be anything but deathly dull
did you tell her that
i certainly did
and i told her that what she really objected to was that i was having a better time than she was
anthony applauded her
he was tremendously proud of gloria proud that she never failed to eclipse whatever other women might be in the party proud that men were always glad to revel with her in great rowdy groups without any attempt to do more than enjoy her beauty and the warmth of her vitality
these parties gradually became their chief source of entertainment
still in love still enormously interested in each other they yet found as spring drew near that staying at home in the evening palled on them books were unreal the old magic of being alone had long since vanishedinstead they preferred to be bored by a stupid musical comedy or to go to dinner with the most uninteresting of their acquaintances so long as there would be enough cocktails to keep the conversation from becoming utterly intolerable
a scattering of younger married people who had been their friends in school or college as well as a varied assortment of single men began to think instinctively of them whenever color and excitement were needed so there was scarcely a day without its phone call its wondered what you were doing this evening
wives as a rule were afraid of gloriaher facile attainment of the centre of the stage her innocent but nevertheless disturbing way of becoming a favorite with husbandsthese things drove them instinctively into an attitude of profound distrust heightened by the fact that gloria was largely unresponsive to any intimacy shown her by a woman
on the appointed wednesday in february anthony had gone to the imposing offices of wilson hiemer and hardy and listened to many vague instructions delivered by an energetic young man of about his own age named kahler who wore a defiant yellow pompadour and in announcing himself as an assistant secretary gave the impression that it was a tribute to exceptional ability
there's two kinds of men here you'll find he said
there's the man who gets to be an assistant secretary or treasurer gets his name on our folder here before he's thirty and there's the man who gets his name there at fortyfive
the man who gets his name there at fortyfive stays there the rest of his life
how about the man who gets it there at thirty
inquired anthony politely
why he gets up here you see
he pointed to a list of assistant vicepresidents upon the folder
or maybe he gets to be president or secretary or treasurer
and what about these over here
those
oh those are the trusteesthe men with capital
i see
now some people continued kahler think that whether a man gets started early or late depends on whether he's got a college education
but they're wrong
i see
i had one i was buckleigh class of nineteeneleven but when i came down to the street i soon found that the things that would help me here weren't the fancy things i learned in college
in fact i had to get a lot of fancy stuff out of my head
anthony could not help wondering what possible fancy stuff he had learned at buckleigh in nineteeneleven
an irrepressible idea that it was some sort of needlework recurred to him throughout the rest of the conversation
see that fellow over there
kahler pointed to a youngishlooking man with handsome gray hair sitting at a desk inside a mahogany railing
that's mr ellinger the first vicepresident
been everywhere seen everything got a fine education
in vain did anthony try to open his mind to the romance of finance he could think of mr ellinger only as one of the buyers of the handsome leather sets of thackeray balzac hugo and gibbon that lined the walls of the big bookstores
through the damp and uninspiring month of march he was prepared for salesmanship
lacking enthusiasm he was capable of viewing the turmoil and bustle that surrounded him only as a fruitless circumambient striving toward an incomprehensible goal tangibly evidenced only by the rival mansions of mr frick and mr carnegie on fifth avenue
that these portentous vicepresidents and trustees should be actually the fathers of the best men he had known at harvard seemed to him incongruous
he ate in an employees' lunchroom upstairs with an uneasy suspicion that he was being uplifted wondering through that first week if the dozens of young clerks some of them alert and immaculate and just out of college lived in flamboyant hope of crowding onto that narrow slip of cardboard before the catastrophic thirties
the conversation that interwove with the pattern of the day's work was all much of a piece
one discussed how mr wilson had made his money what method mr hiemer had employed and the means resorted to by mr hardy
one related ageold but eternally breathless anecdotes of the fortunes stumbled on precipitously in the street by a butcher or a bartender or a darn messenger boy by golly
and then one talked of the current gambles and whether it was best to go out for a hundred thousand a year or be content with twenty
during the preceding year one of the assistant secretaries had invested all his savings in bethlehem steel
the story of his spectacular magnificence of his haughty resignation in january and of the triumphal palace he was now building in california was the favorite office subject
the man's very name had acquired a magic significance symbolizing as he did the aspirations of all good americans
anecdotes were told about himhow one of the vicepresidents had advised him to sell by golly but he had hung on even bought on margin and now look where he is
such obviously was the stuff of lifea dizzy triumph dazzling the eyes of all of them a gypsy siren to content them with meagre wage and with the arithmetical improbability of their eventual success
to anthony the notion became appalling
he felt that to succeed here the idea of success must grasp and limit his mind
it seemed to him that the essential element in these men at the top was their faith that their affairs were the very core of life
all other things being equal selfassurance and opportunism won out over technical knowledge it was obvious that the more expert work went on near the bottomso with appropriate efficiency the technical experts were kept there
his determination to stay in at night during the week did not survive and a good half of the time he came to work with a splitting sickish headache and the crowded horror of the morning subway ringing in his ears like an echo of hell
then abruptly he quit
he had remained in bed all one monday and late in the evening overcome by one of those attacks of moody despair to which he periodically succumbed he wrote and mailed a letter to mr wilson confessing that he considered himself ill adapted to the work
gloria coming in from the theatre with richard caramel found him on the lounge silently staring at the high ceiling more depressed and discouraged than he had been at any time since their marriage
she wanted him to whine
if he had she would have reproached him bitterly for she was not a little annoyed but he only lay there so utterly miserable that she felt sorry for him and kneeling down she stroked his head saying how little it mattered how little anything mattered so long as they loved each other
it was like their first year and anthony reacting to her cool hand to her voice that was soft as breath itself upon his ear became almost cheerful and talked with her of his future plans
he even regretted silently before he went to bed that he had so hastily mailed his resignation
even when everything seems rotten you can't trust that judgment gloria had said
it's the sum of all your judgments that counts
in midapril came a letter from the realestate agent in marietta encouraging them to take the gray house for another year at a slightly increased rental and enclosing a lease made out for their signatures
for a week lease and letter lay carelessly neglected on anthony's desk
they had no intention of returning to marietta
they were weary of the place and had been bored most of the preceding summer
besides their car had deteriorated to a rattling mass of hypochondriacal metal and a new one was financially inadvisable
but because of another wild revel enduring through four days and participated in at one time or another by more than a dozen people they did sign the lease to their utter horror they signed it and sent it and immediately it seemed as though they heard the gray house drably malevolent at last licking its white chops and waiting to devour them
anthony where's that lease
she called in high alarm one sunday morning sick and sober to reality
where did you leave it
it was here
then she knew where it was
she remembered the house party they had planned on the crest of their exuberance she remembered a room full of men to whose less exhilarated moments she and anthony were of no importance and anthony's boast of the transcendent merit and seclusion of the gray house that it was so isolated that it didn't matter how much noise went on there
then dick who had visited them cried enthusiastically that it was the best little house imaginable and that they were idiotic not to take it for another summer
it had been easy to work themselves up to a sense of how hot and deserted the city was getting of how cool and ambrosial were the charms of marietta
anthony had picked up the lease and waved it wildly found gloria happily acquiescent and with one last burst of garrulous decision during which all the men agreed with solemn handshakes that they would come out for a visit   anthony she cried we've signed and sent it
what
the lease
what the devil
oh anthony
there was utter misery in her voice
for the summer for eternity they had built themselves a prison
it seemed to strike at the last roots of their stability
anthony thought they might arrange it with the realestate agent
they could no longer afford the double rent and going to marietta meant giving up his apartment his reproachless apartment with the exquisite bath and the rooms for which he had bought his furniture and hangingsit was the closest to a home that he had ever hadfamiliar with memories of four colorful years
but it was not arranged with the realestate agent nor was it arranged at all
dispiritedly without even any talk of making the best of it without even gloria's allsufficing i don't care they went back to the house that they now knew heeded neither youth nor loveonly those austere and incommunicable memories that they could never share
the sinister summer  there was a horror in the house that summer
it came with them and settled itself over the place like a sombre pall pervasive through the lower rooms gradually spreading and climbing up the narrow stairs until it oppressed their very sleep
anthony and gloria grew to hate being there alone
her bedroom which had seemed so pink and young and delicate appropriate to her pastelshaded lingerie tossed here and there on chair and bed seemed now to whisper with its rustling curtains  ah my beautiful young lady yours is not the first daintiness and delicacy that has faded here under the summer suns  generations of unloved women have adorned themselves by that glass for rustic lovers who paid no heed
youth has come into this room in palest blue and left it in the gray cerements of despair and through long nights many girls have lain awake where that bed stands pouring out waves of misery into the darkness
gloria finally tumbled all her clothes and unguents ingloriously out of it declaring that she had come to live with anthony and making the excuse that one of her screens was rotten and admitted bugs
so her room was abandoned to insensitive guests and they dressed and slept in her husband's chamber which gloria considered somehow good as though anthony's presence there had acted as exterminator of any uneasy shadows of the past that might have hovered about its walls
the distinction between good and bad ordered early and summarily out of both their lives had been reinstated in another form
gloria insisted that any one invited to the gray house must be good which in the case of a girl meant that she must be either simple and reproachless or if otherwise must possess a certain solidity and strength
always intensely sceptical of her sex her judgments were now concerned with the question of whether women were or were not clean
by uncleanliness she meant a variety of things a lack of pride a slackness in fibre and most of all the unmistakable aura of promiscuity
women soil easily she said far more easily than men
unless a girl's very young and brave it's almost impossible for her to go downhill without a certain hysterical animality the cunning dirty sort of animality
a man's differentand i suppose that's why one of the commonest characters of romance is a man going gallantly to the devil
she was disposed to like many men preferably those who gave her frank homage and unfailing entertainmentbut often with a flash of insight she told anthony that some one of his friends was merely using him and consequently had best be left alone
anthony customarily demurred insisting that the accused was a good one but he found that his judgment was more fallible than hers memorably when as it happened on several occasions he was left with a succession of restaurant checks for which to render a solitary account
more from their fear of solitude than from any desire to go through the fuss and bother of entertaining they filled the house with guests every weekend and often on through the week
the weekend parties were much the same
when the three or four men invited had arrived drinking was more or less in order followed by a hilarious dinner and a ride to the cradle beach country club which they had joined because it was inexpensive lively if not fashionable and almost a necessity for just such occasions as these
moreover it was of no great moment what one did there and so long as the patch party were reasonably inaudible it mattered little whether or not the social dictators of cradle beach saw the gay gloria imbibing cocktails in the supper room at frequent intervals during the evening
saturday ended generally in a glamourous confusionit proving often necessary to assist a muddled guest to bed
sunday brought the new york papers and a quiet morning of recuperating on the porchand sunday afternoon meant goodby to the one or two guests who must return to the city and a great revival of drinking among the one or two who remained until next day concluding in a convivial if not hilarious evening
the faithful tana pedagogue by nature and man of all work by profession had returned with them
among their more frequent guests a tradition had sprung up about him
maury noble remarked one afternoon that his real name was tannenbaum and that he was a german agent kept in this country to disseminate teutonic propaganda through westchester county and after that mysterious letters began to arrive from philadelphia addressed to the bewildered oriental as lt emile tannenbaum containing a few cryptic messages signed general staff and adorned with an atmospheric double column of facetious japanese
anthony always handed them to tana without a smile hours afterward the recipient could be found puzzling over them in the kitchen and declaring earnestly that the perpendicular symbols were not japanese nor anything resembling japanese
gloria had taken a strong dislike to the man ever since the day when returning unexpectedly from the village she had discovered him reclining on anthony's bed puzzling out a newspaper
it was the instinct of all servants to be fond of anthony and to detest gloria and tana was no exception to the rule
but he was thoroughly afraid of her and made plain his aversion only in his moodier moments by subtly addressing anthony with remarks intended for her ear  what miz pats want dinner
he would say looking at his master
or else he would comment about the bitter selfishness of 'merican peoples in such manner that there was no doubt who were the peoples referred to
but they dared not dismiss him
such a step would have been abhorrent to their inertia
they endured tana as they endured ill weather and sickness of the body and the estimable will of godas they endured all things even themselves
in darkness  one sultry afternoon late in july richard caramel telephoned from new york that he and maury were coming out bringing a friend with them
they arrived about five a little drunk accompanied by a small stocky man of thirtyfive whom they introduced as mr joe hull one of the best fellows that anthony and gloria had ever met
joe hull had a yellow beard continually fighting through his skin and a low voice which varied between basso profundo and a husky whisper
anthony carrying maury's suitcase upstairs followed into the room and carefully closed the door
who is this fellow
he demanded
maury chuckled enthusiastically
who hull
oh he's all right
he's a good one
yes but who is he
hull
he's just a good fellow
he's a prince
his laughter redoubled culminating in a succession of pleasant catlike grins
anthony hesitated between a smile and a frown
he looks sort of funny to me
weirdlooking clotheshe pausedi've got a sneaking suspicion you two picked him up somewhere last night
ridiculous declared maury
why i've known him all my life
however as he capped this statement with another series of chuckles anthony was impelled to remark the devil you have
later just before dinner while maury and dick were conversing uproariously with joe hull listening in silence as he sipped his drink gloria drew anthony into the dining room  i don't like this man hull she said
i wish he'd use tana's bathtub
i can't very well ask him to
well i don't want him in ours
he seems to be a simple soul
he's got on white shoes that look like gloves
i can see his toes right through them
uh
who is he anyway
you've got me
well i think they've got their nerve to bring him out here
this isn't a sailor's rescue home
they were tight when they phoned
maury said they've been on a party since yesterday afternoon
gloria shook her head angrily and saying no more returned to the porch
anthony saw that she was trying to forget her uncertainty and devote herself to enjoying the evening
it had been a tropical day and even into late twilight the heatwaves emanating from the dry road were quivering faintly like undulating panes of isinglass
the sky was cloudless but far beyond the woods in the direction of the sound a faint and persistent rolling had commenced
when tana announced dinner the men at a word from gloria remained coatless and went inside
maury began a song which they accomplished in harmony during the first course
it had two lines and was sung to a popular air called daisy dear
the lines were  thepanichascomeover us so haaasthe moral decline
each rendition was greeted with bursts of enthusiasm and prolonged applause
cheer up gloria
suggested maury
you seem the least bit depressed
i'm not she lied
here tannenbaum
he called over his shoulder
i've filled you a drink
come on
gloria tried to stay his arm
please don't maury
why not
maybe he'll play the flute for us after dinner
here tana
tana grinning bore the glass away to the kitchen
in a few moments maury gave him another
cheer up gloria
he cried
for heaven's sakes everybody cheer up gloria
dearest have another drink counselled anthony
do please
cheer up gloria said joe hull easily
gloria winced at this uncalledfor use of her first name and glanced around to see if any one else had noticed it
the word coming so glibly from the lips of a man to whom she had taken an inordinate dislike repelled her
a moment later she noticed that joe hull had given tana another drink and her anger increased heightened somewhat from the effects of the alcohol  
and once maury was saying peter granby and i went into a turkish bath in boston about two o'clock at night
there was no one there but the proprietor and we jammed him into a closet and locked the door
then a fella came in and wanted a turkish bath
thought we were the rubbers by golly
well we just picked him up and tossed him into the pool with all his clothes on
then we dragged him out and laid him on a slab and slapped him until he was black and blue
'not so rough fellows'
he'd say in a little squeaky voice 'please
'  was this maury
thought gloria
from any one else the story would have amused her but from maury the infinitely appreciative the apotheosis of tact and consideration  thepanichascomeover us so haaas  a drum of thunder from outside drowned out the rest of the song gloria shivered and tried to empty her glass but the first taste nauseated her and she set it down
dinner was over and they all marched into the big room bearing several bottles and decanters
some one had closed the porch door to keep out the wind and in consequence circular tentacles of cigar smoke were twisting already upon the heavy air
paging lieutenant tannenbaum
again it was the changeling maury
bring us the flute
anthony and maury rushed into the kitchen richard caramel started the phonograph and approached gloria
dance with your wellknown cousin
i don't want to dance
then i'm going to carry you around
as though he were doing something of overpowering importance he picked her up in his fat little arms and started trotting gravely about the room
set me down dick
i'm dizzy
she insisted
he dumped her in a bouncing bundle on the couch and rushed off to the kitchen shouting tana
tana
then without warning she felt other arms around her felt herself lifted from the lounge
joe hull had picked her up and was trying drunkenly to imitate dick
put me down
she said sharply
his maudlin laugh and the sight of that prickly yellow jaw close to her face stirred her to intolerable disgust
at once
thepanic he began but got no further for gloria's hand swung around swiftly and caught him in the cheek
at this he all at once let go of her and she fell to the floor her shoulder hitting the table a glancing blow in transit  then the room seemed full of men and smoke
there was tana in his white coat reeling about supported by maury
into his flute he was blowing a weird blend of sound that was known cried anthony as the japanese trainsong
joe hull had found a box of candles and was juggling them yelling one down
every time he missed and dick was dancing by himself in a fascinated whirl around and about the room
it appeared to her that everything in the room was staggering in grotesque fourthdimensional gyrations through intersecting planes of hazy blue
outside the storm had come up amazinglythe lulls within were filled with the scrape of the tall bushes against the house and the roaring of the rain on the tin roof of the kitchen
the lightning was interminable letting down thick drips of thunder like pig iron from the heart of a whitehot furnace
gloria could see that the rain was spitting in at three of the windowsbut she could not move to shut them   she was in the hall
she had said good night but no one had heard or heeded her
it seemed for an instant as though something had looked down over the head of the banister but she could not have gone back into the living roombetter madness than the madness of that clamor upstairs she fumbled for the electric switch and missed it in the darkness a roomful of lightning showed her the button plainly on the wall
but when the impenetrable black shut down it again eluded her fumbling fingers so she slipped off her dress and petticoat and threw herself weakly on the dry side of the halfdrenched bed
she shut her eyes
from downstairs arose the babel of the drinkers punctured suddenly by a tinkling shiver of broken glass and then another and by a soaring fragment of unsteady irregular song  she lay there for something over two hoursso she calculated afterward sheerly by piecing together the bits of time
she was conscious even aware after a long while that the noise downstairs had lessened and that the storm was moving off westward throwing back lingering showers of sound that fell heavy and lifeless as her soul into the soggy fields
this was succeeded by a slow reluctant scattering of the rain and wind until there was nothing outside her windows but a gentle dripping and the swishing play of a cluster of wet vine against the sill
she was in a state halfway between sleeping and waking with neither condition predominant  and she was harassed by a desire to rid herself of a weight pressing down upon her breast
she felt that if she could cry the weight would be lifted and forcing the lids of her eyes together she tried to raise a lump in her throat  to no avail  drip
drip
drip
the sound was not unpleasantlike spring like a cool rain of her childhood that made cheerful mud in her back yard and watered the tiny garden she had dug with miniature rake and spade and hoe
dripdriip
it was like days when the rain came out of yellow skies that melted just before twilight and shot one radiant shaft of sunlight diagonally down the heavens into the damp green trees
so cool so clear and cleanand her mother there at the centre of the world at the centre of the rain safe and dry and strong
she wanted her mother now and her mother was dead beyond sight and touch forever
and this weight was pressing on her pressing on heroh it pressed on her so
she became rigid
some one had come to the door and was standing regarding her very quiet except for a slight swaying motion
she could see the outline of his figure distinct against some indistinguishable light
there was no sound anywhere only a great persuasive silenceeven the dripping had ceased  only this figure swaying swaying in the doorway an indiscernible and subtly menacing terror a personality filthy under its varnish like smallpox spots under a layer of powder
yet her tired heart beating until it shook her breasts made her sure that there was still life in her desperately shaken threatened
the minute or succession of minutes prolonged itself interminably and a swimming blur began to form before her eyes which tried with childish persistence to pierce the gloom in the direction of the door
in another instant it seemed that some unimaginable force would shatter her out of existence  and then the figure in the doorwayit was hull she saw hullturned deliberately and still slightly swaying moved back and off as if absorbed into that incomprehensible light that had given him dimension
blood rushed back into her limbs blood and life together
with a start of energy she sat upright shifting her body until her feet touched the floor over the side of the bed
she knew what she must donow now before it was too late
she must go out into this cool damp out away to feel the wet swish of the grass around her feet and the fresh moisture on her forehead
mechanically she struggled into her clothes groping in the dark of the closet for a hat
she must go from this house where the thing hovered that pressed upon her bosom or else made itself into stray swaying figures in the gloom
in a panic she fumbled clumsily at her coat found the sleeve just as she heard anthony's footsteps on the lower stair
she dared not wait he might not let her go and even anthony was part of this weight part of this evil house and the sombre darkness that was growing up about it
through the hall then  and down the back stairs hearing anthony's voice in the bedroom she had just left  gloria
gloria
but she had reached the kitchen now passed out through the doorway into the night
a hundred drops startled by a flare of wind from a dripping tree scattered on her and she pressed them gladly to her face with hot hands
gloria
gloria
the voice was infinitely remote muffed and made plaintive by the walls she had just left
she rounded the house and started down the front path toward the road almost exultant as she turned into it and followed the carpet of short grass alongside moving with caution in the intense darkness
gloria
she broke into a run stumbled over the segment of a branch twisted off by the wind
the voice was outside the house now
anthony finding the bedroom deserted had come onto the porch
but this thing was driving her forward it was back there with anthony and she must go on in her flight under this dim and oppressive heaven forcing herself through the silence ahead as though it were a tangible barrier before her
she had gone some distance along the barely discernible road probably half a mile passed a single deserted barn that loomed up black and foreboding the only building of any sort between the gray house and marietta then she turned the fork where the road entered the wood and ran between two high walls of leaves and branches that nearly touched overhead
she noticed suddenly a thin longitudinal gleam of silver upon the road before her like a bright sword half embedded in the mud
as she came closer she gave a little cry of satisfactionit was a wagonrut full of water and glancing heavenward she saw a light rift of sky and knew that the moon was out
gloria
she started violently
anthony was not two hundred feet behind her
gloria wait for me
she shut her lips tightly to keep from screaming and increased her gait
before she had gone another hundred yards the woods disappeared rolling back like a dark stocking from the leg of the road
three minutes' walk ahead of her suspended in the now high and limitless air she saw a thin interlacing of attenuated gleams and glitters centred in a regular undulation on some one invisible point
abruptly she knew where she would go
that was the great cascade of wires that rose high over the river like the legs of a gigantic spider whose eye was the little green light in the switchhouse and ran with the railroad bridge in the direction of the station
the station
there would be the train to take her away
gloria it's me
it's anthony
gloria i won't try to stop you
for god's sake where are you
she made no answer but began to run keeping on the high side of the road and leaping the gleaming puddlesdimensionless pools of thin unsubstantial gold
turning sharply to the left she followed a narrow wagon road serving to avoid a dark body on the ground
she looked up as an owl hooted mournfully from a solitary tree
just ahead of her she could see the trestle that led to the railroad bridge and the steps mounting up to it
the station lay across the river
another sounds startled her the melancholy siren of an approaching train and almost simultaneously a repeated call thin now and far away
gloria
gloria
anthony must have followed the main road
she laughed with a sort of malicious cunning at having eluded him she could spare the time to wait until the train went by
the siren soared again closer at hand and then with no anticipatory roar and clamor a dark and sinuous body curved into view against the shadows far down the highbanked track and with no sound but the rush of the cleft wind and the clocklike tick of the rails moved toward the bridgeit was an electric train
above the engine two vivid blurs of blue light formed incessantly a radiant crackling bar between them which like a spluttering flame in a lamp beside a corpse lit for an instant the successive rows of trees and caused gloria to draw back instinctively to the far side of the road
the light was tepid the temperature of warm blood
the clicking blended suddenly with itself in a rush of even sound and then elongating in sombre elasticity the thing roared blindly by her and thundered onto the bridge racing the lurid shaft of fire it cast into the solemn river alongside
then it contracted swiftly sucking in its sound until it left only a reverberant echo which died upon the farther bank
silence crept down again over the wet country the faint dripping resumed and suddenly a great shower of drops tumbled upon gloria stirring her out of the trancelike torpor which the passage of the train had wrought
she ran swiftly down a descending level to the bank and began climbing the iron stairway to the bridge remembering that it was something she had always wanted to do and that she would have the added excitement of traversing the yardwide plank that ran beside the tracks over the river
there
this was better
she was at the top now and could see the lands about her as successive sweeps of open country cold under the moon coarsely patched and seamed with thin rows and heavy clumps of trees
to her right half a mile down the river which trailed away behind the light like the shiny slimy path of a snail winked the scattered lights of marietta
not two hundred yards away at the end of the bridge squatted the station marked by a sullen lantern
the oppression was lifted nowthe treetops below her were rocking the young starlight to a haunted doze
she stretched out her arms with a gesture of freedom
this was what she had wanted to stand alone where it was high and cool
gloria
like a startled child she scurried along the plank hopping skipping jumping with an ecstatic sense of her own physical lightness
let him come nowshe no longer feared that only she must first reach the station because that was part of the game
she was happy
her hat snatched off was clutched tightly in her hand and her short curled hair bobbed up and down about her ears
she had thought she would never feel so young again but this was her night her world
triumphantly she laughed as she left the plank and reaching the wooden platform flung herself down happily beside an iron roofpost
here i am
she called gay as the dawn in her elation
here i am anthony dearold worried anthony
gloria
he reached the platform ran toward her
are you all right
coming up he knelt and took her in his arms
yes
what was the matter
why did you leave
he queried anxiously
i had tothere was somethingshe paused and a flicker of uneasiness lashed at her mindthere was something sitting on mehere
she put her hand on her breast
i had to go out and get away from it
what do you mean by 'something'
i don't knowthat man hull  did he bother you
he came to my door drunk
i think i'd gotten sort of crazy by that time
gloria dearest  wearily she laid her head upon his shoulder
let's go back he suggested
she shivered
uh
no i couldn't
it'd come and sit on me again
her voice rose to a cry that hung plaintive on the darkness
that thing  therethere he soothed her pulling her close to him
we won't do anything you don't want to do
what do you want to do
just sit here
i wanti want to go away
where
ohanywhere
by golly gloria he cried you're still tight
no i'm not
i haven't been all evening
i went upstairs about oh i don't know about half an hour after dinner ouch
he had inadvertently touched her right shoulder
it hurts me
i hurt it some way
i don't knowsomebody picked me up and dropped me
gloria come home
it's late and damp
i can't she wailed
oh anthony don't ask me to
i will tomorrow
you go home and i'll wait here for a train
i'll go to a hotel  i'll go with you
no i don't want you with me
i want to be alone
i want to sleepoh i want to sleep
and then tomorrow when you've got all the smell of whiskey and cigarettes out of the house and everything straight and hull is gone then i'll come home
if i went now that thingoh
she covered her eyes with her hand anthony saw the futility of trying to persuade her
i was all sober when you left he said
dick was asleep on the lounge and maury and i were having a discussion
that fellow hull had wandered off somewhere
then i began to realize i hadn't seen you for several hours so i went upstairs  he broke off as a salutatory hello there
boomed suddenly out of the darkness
gloria sprang to her feet and he did likewise
it's maury's voice she cried excitedly
if it's hull with him keep them away keep them away
who's there
anthony called
just dick and maury returned two voices reassuringly
where's hull
he's in bed
passed out
their figures appeared dimly on the platform
what the devil are you and gloria doing here
inquired richard caramel with sleepy bewilderment
what are you two doing here
maury laughed
damned if i know
we followed you and had the deuce of a time doing it
i heard you out on the porch yelling for gloria so i woke up the caramel here and got it through his head with some difficulty that if there was a searchparty we'd better be on it
he slowed me up by sitting down in the road at intervals and asking me what it was all about
we tracked you by the pleasant scent of canadian club
there was a rattle of nervous laughter under the low trainshed
how did you track us really
well we followed along down the road and then we suddenly lost you
seems you turned off at a wagontrail
after a while somebody hailed us and asked us if we were looking for a young girl
well we came up and found it was a little shivering old man sitting on a fallen tree like somebody in a fairy tale
'she turned down here' he said 'and most steppud on me goin' somewhere in an awful hustle and then a fella in short golfin' pants come runnin' along and went after her
he throwed me this'
the old fellow had a dollar bill he was waving around  oh the poor old man
ejaculated gloria moved
i threw him another and we went on though he asked us to stay and tell him what it was all about
poor old man repeated gloria dismally
dick sat down sleepily on a box
and now what
he inquired in the tone of stoic resignation
gloria's upset explained anthony
she and i are going to the city by the next train
maury in the darkness had pulled a timetable from his pocket
strike a match
a tiny flare leaped out of the opaque background illuminating the four faces grotesque and unfamiliar here in the open night
let's see
two twothirtyno that's evening
by gad you won't get a train till fivethirty
anthony hesitated
well he muttered uncertainly we've decided to stay here and wait for it
you two might as well go back and sleep
you go too anthony urged gloria i want you to have some sleep dear
you've been as pale as a ghost all day
why you little idiot
dick yawned
very well
you stay we stay
he walked out from under the shed and surveyed the heavens
rather a nice night after all
stars are out and everything
exceptionally tasty assortment of them
let's see
gloria moved after him and the other two followed her
let's sit out here she suggested
i like it much better
anthony and dick converted a long box into a backrest and found a board dry enough for gloria to sit on
anthony dropped down beside her and with some effort dick hoisted himself onto an applebarrel near them
tana went to sleep in the porch hammock he remarked
we carried him in and left him next to the kitchen stove to dry
he was drenched to the skin
that awful little man
sighed gloria
how do you do
the voice sonorous and funereal had come from above and they looked up startled to find that in some manner maury had climbed to the roof of the shed where he sat dangling his feet over the edge outlined as a shadowy and fantastic gargoyle against the now brilliant sky
it must be for such occasions as this he began softly his words having the effect of floating down from an immense height and settling softly upon his auditors that the righteous of the land decorate the railroads with billboards asserting in red and yellow that 'jesus christ is god' placing them appropriately enough next to announcements that 'gunter's whiskey is good'
there was gentle laughter and the three below kept their heads tilted upward
i think i shall tell you the story of my education continued maury under these sardonic constellations
do
please
shall i really
they waited expectantly while he directed a ruminative yawn toward the white smiling moon
well he began as an infant i prayed
i stored up prayers against future wickedness
one year i stored up nineteen hundred 'now i lay me's'
throw down a cigarette murmured some one
a small package reached the platform simultaneously with the stentorian command  silence
i am about to unburden myself of many memorable remarks reserved for the darkness of such earths and the brilliance of such skies
below a lighted match was passed from cigarette to cigarette
the voice resumed  i was adept at fooling the deity
i prayed immediately after all crimes until eventually prayer and crime became indistinguishable to me
i believed that because a man cried out 'my god'
when a safe fell on him it proved that belief was rooted deep in the human breast
then i went to school
for fourteen years half a hundred earnest men pointed to ancient flintlocks and cried to me 'there's the real thing
these new rifles are only shallow superficial imitations'
they damned the books i read and the things i thought by calling them immoral later the fashion changed and they damned things by calling them 'clever'
and so i turned canny for my years from the professors to the poets listeningto the lyric tenor of swinburne and the tenor robusto of shelley to shakespeare with his first bass and his fine range to tennyson with his second bass and his occasional falsetto to milton and marlow bassos profundo
i gave ear to browning chatting byron declaiming and wordsworth droning
this at least did me no harm
i learned a little of beautyenough to know that it had nothing to do with truthand i found moreover that there was no great literary tradition there was only the tradition of the eventful death of every literary tradition  then i grew up and the beauty of succulent illusions fell away from me
the fibre of my mind coarsened and my eyes grew miserably keen
life rose around my island like a sea and presently i was swimming
the transition was subtlethe thing had lain in wait for me for some time
it has its insidious seemingly innocuous trap for every one
with me
noi didn't try to seduce the janitor's wifenor did i run through the streets unclothed proclaiming my virility
it is never quite passion that does the businessit is the dress that passion wears
i became boredthat was all
boredom which is another name and a frequent disguise for vitality became the unconscious motive of all my acts
beauty was behind me do you understandi was grown
he paused
end of school and college period
opening of part two
three quietly active points of light showed the location of his listeners
gloria was now half sitting half lying in anthony's lap
his arm was around her so tightly that she could hear the beating of his heart
richard caramel perched on the applebarrel from time to time stirred and gave off a faint grunt
i grew up then into this land of jazz and fell immediately into a state of almost audible confusion
life stood over me like an immoral schoolmistress editing my ordered thoughts
but with a mistaken faith in intelligence i plodded on
i read smith who laughed at charity and insisted that the sneer was the highest form of selfexpressionbut smith himself replaced charity as an obscurer of the light
i read jones who neatly disposed of individualismand behold
jones was still in my way
i did not thinki was a battleground for the thoughts of many men rather was i one of those desirable but impotent countries over which the great powers surge back and forth
i reached maturity under the impression that i was gathering the experience to order my life for happiness
indeed i accomplished the not unusual feat of solving each question in my mind long before it presented itself to me in lifeand of being beaten and bewildered just the same
but after a few tastes of this latter dish i had had enough
here
i said experience is not worth the getting
it's not a thing that happens pleasantly to a passive youit's a wall that an active you runs up against
so i wrapped myself in what i thought was my invulnerable scepticism and decided that my education was complete
but it was too late
protect myself as i might by making no new ties with tragic and predestined humanity i was lost with the rest
i had traded the fight against love for the fight against loneliness the fight against life for the fight against death
he broke off to give emphasis to his last observationafter a moment he yawned and resumed
i suppose that the beginning of the second phase of my education was a ghastly dissatisfaction at being used in spite of myself for some inscrutable purpose of whose ultimate goal i was unawareif indeed there was an ultimate goal
it was a difficult choice
the schoolmistress seemed to be saying 'we're going to play football and nothing but football
if you don't want to play football you can't play at all'  what was i to dothe playtime was so short
you see i felt that we were even denied what consolation there might have been in being a figment of a corporate man rising from his knees
do you think that i leaped at this pessimism grasped it as a sweetly smug superior thing no more depressing really than say a gray autumn day before a firei don't think i did that
i was a great deal too warm for that and too alive
for it seemed to me that there was no ultimate goal for man
man was beginning a grotesque and bewildered fight with naturenature that by the divine and magnificent accident had brought us to where we could fly in her face
she had invented ways to rid the race of the inferior and thus give the remainder strength to fill her higheror let us say her more amusingthough still unconscious and accidental intentions
and actuated by the highest gifts of the enlightenment we were seeking to circumvent her
in this republic i saw the black beginning to mingle with the whitein europe there was taking place an economic catastrophe to save three or four diseased and wretchedly governed races from the one mastery that might organize them for material prosperity
we produce a christ who can raise up the leperand presently the breed of the leper is the salt of the earth
if any one can find any lesson in that let him stand forth
there's only one lesson to be learned from life anyway interrupted gloria not in contradiction but in a sort of melancholy agreement
what's that
demanded maury sharply
that there's no lesson to be learned from life
after a short silence maury said  young gloria the beautiful and merciless lady first looked at the world with the fundamental sophistication i have struggled to attain that anthony never will attain that dick will never fully understand
there was a disgusted groan from the applebarrel
anthony grown accustomed to the dark could see plainly the flash of richard caramel's yellow eye and the look of resentment on his face as he cried  you're crazy
by your own statement i should have attained some experience by trying
trying what
cried maury fiercely
trying to pierce the darkness of political idealism with some wild despairing urge toward truth
sitting day after day supine in a rigid chair and infinitely removed from life staring at the tip of a steeple through the trees trying to separate definitely and for all time the knowable from the unknowable
trying to take a piece of actuality and give it glamour from your own soul to make for that inexpressible quality it possessed in life and lost in transit to paper or canvas
struggling in a laboratory through weary years for one iota of relative truth in a mass of wheels or a test tube  have you
maury paused and in his answer when it came there was a measure of weariness a bitter overnote that lingered for a moment in those three minds before it floated up and off like a bubble bound for the moon
not i he said softly
i was born tiredbut with the quality of mother wit the gift of women like gloriato that for all my talking and listening my waiting in vain for the eternal generality that seems to lie just beyond every argument and every speculation to that i have added not one jot
in the distance a deep sound that had been audible for some moments identified itself by a plaintive mooing like that of a gigantic cow and by the pearly spot of a headlight apparent half a mile away
it was a steamdriven train this time rumbling and groaning and as it tumbled by with a monstrous complaint it sent a shower of sparks and cinders over the platform
not one jot
again maury's voice dropped down to them as from a great height
what a feeble thing intelligence is with its short steps its waverings its pacings back and forth its disastrous retreats
intelligence is a mere instrument of circumstances
there are people who say that intelligence must have built the universewhy intelligence never built a steam engine
circumstances built a steam engine
intelligence is little more than a short footrule by which we measure the infinite achievements of circumstances
i could quote you the philosophy of the hourbut for all we know fifty years may see a complete reversal of this abnegation that's absorbing the intellectuals today the triumph of christ over anatole france he hesitated and then added but all i knowthe tremendous importance of myself to me and the necessity of acknowledging that importance to myselfthese things the wise and lovely gloria was born knowing these things and the painful futility of trying to know anything else
well i started to tell you of my education didn't i
but i learned nothing you see very little even about myself
and if i had i should die with my lips shut and the guard on my fountain penas the wisest men have done sinceoh since the failure of a certain mattera strange matter by the way
it concerned some sceptics who thought they were farsighted just as you and i
let me tell you about them by way of an evening prayer before you all drop off to sleep
once upon a time all the men of mind and genius in the world became of one beliefthat is to say of no belief
but it wearied them to think that within a few years after their death many cults and systems and prognostications would be ascribed to them which they had never meditated nor intended
so they said to one another  'let's join together and make a great book that will last forever to mock the credulity of man
let's persuade our more erotic poets to write about the delights of the flesh and induce some of our robust journalists to contribute stories of famous amours
we'll include all the most preposterous old wives' tales now current
we'll choose the keenest satirist alive to compile a deity from all the deities worshipped by mankind a deity who will be more magnificent than any of them and yet so weakly human that he'll become a byword for laughter the world overand we'll ascribe to him all sorts of jokes and vanities and rages in which he'll be supposed to indulge for his own diversion so that the people will read our book and ponder it and there'll be no more nonsense in the world
'finally let us take care that the book possesses all the virtues of style so that it may last forever as a witness to our profound scepticism and our universal irony'
so the men did and they died
but the book lived always so beautifully had it been written and so astounding the quality of imagination with which these men of mind and genius had endowed it
they had neglected to give it a name but after they were dead it became known as the bible
when he concluded there was no comment
some damp languor sleeping on the air of night seemed to have bewitched them all
as i said i started on the story of my education
but my highballs are dead and the night's almost over and soon there'll be an awful jabbering going on everywhere in the trees and the houses and the two little stores over there behind the station and there'll be a great running up and down upon the earth for a few hourswell he concluded with a laugh thank god we four can all pass to our eternal rest knowing we've left the world a little better for having lived in it
a breeze sprang up blowing with it faint wisps of life which flattened against the sky
your remarks grow rambling and inconclusive said anthony sleepily
you expected one of those miracles of illumination by which you say your most brilliant and pregnant things in exactly the setting that should provoke the ideal symposium
meanwhile gloria has shown her farsighted detachment by falling asleepi can tell that by the fact that she has managed to concentrate her entire weight upon my broken body
have i bored you
inquired maury looking down with some concern
no you have disappointed us
you've shot a lot of arrows but did you shoot any birds
i leave the birds to dick said maury hurriedly
i speak erratically in disassociated fragments
you can get no rise from me muttered dick
my mind is full of any number of material things
i want a warm bath too much to worry about the importance of my work or what proportion of us are pathetic figures
dawn made itself felt in a gathering whiteness eastward over the river and an intermittent cheeping in the nearby trees
quarter to five sighed dick almost another hour to wait
look
two gone
he was pointing to anthony whose lids had sagged over his eyes
sleep of the patch family  but in another five minutes despite the amplifying cheeps and chirrups his own head had fallen forward nodded down twice thrice  only maury noble remained awake seated upon the station roof his eyes wide open and fixed with fatigued intensity upon the distant nucleus of morning
he was wondering at the unreality of ideas at the fading radiance of existence and at the little absorptions that were creeping avidly into his life like rats into a ruined house
he was sorry for no one nowon monday morning there would be his business and later there would be a girl of another class whose whole life he was these were the things nearest his heart
in the strangeness of the brightening day it seemed presumptuous that with this feeble broken instrument of his mind he had ever tried to think
there was the sun letting down great glowing masses of heat there was life active and snarling moving about them like a fly swarmthe dark pants of smoke from the engine a crisp all aboard
and a bell ringing
confusedly maury saw eyes in the milk train staring curiously up at him heard gloria and anthony in quick controversy as to whether he should go to the city with her then another clamor and she was gone and the three men pale as ghosts were standing alone upon the platform while a grimy coalheaver went down the road on top of a motor truck carolling hoarsely at the summer morning
chapter iii   the broken lute  it is seventhirty of an august evening
the windows in the living room of the gray house are wide open patiently exchanging the tainted inner atmosphere of liquor and smoke for the fresh drowsiness of the late hot dusk
there are dying flower scents upon the air so thin so fragile as to hint already of a summer laid away in time
but august is still proclaimed relentlessly by a thousand crickets around the sideporch and by one who has broken into the house and concealed himself confidently behind a bookcase from time to time shrieking of his cleverness and his indomitable will  the room itself is in messy disorder
on the table is a dish of fruit which is real but appears artificial
around it are grouped an ominous assortment of decanters glasses and heaped ashtrays the latter still raising wavy smokeladders into the stale air the effect on the whole needing but a skull to resemble that venerable chromo once a fixture in every den which presents the appendages to the life of pleasure with delightful and aweinspiring sentiment  after a while the sprightly solo of the supercricket is interrupted rather than joined by a new soundthe melancholy wail of an erratically fingered flute
it is obvious that the musician is practising rather than performing for from time to time the gnarled strain breaks off and after an interval of indistinct mutterings recommences  just prior to the seventh false start a third sound contributes to the subdued discord
it is a taxi outside
a minute's silence then the taxi again its boisterous retreat almost obliterating the scrape of footsteps on the cinder walk
the doorbell shrieks alarmingly through the house  from the kitchen enters a small fatigued japanese hastily buttoning a servant's coat of white duck
he opens the front screendoor and admits a handsome young man of thirty clad in the sort of wellintentioned clothes peculiar to those who serve mankind
to his whole personality clings a wellintentioned air his glance about the room is compounded of curiosity and a determined optimism when he looks at tana the entire burden of uplifting the godless oriental is in his eyes
his name is frederick e paramore
he was at harvard with anthony where because of the initials of their surnames they were constantly placed next to each other in classes
a fragmentary acquaintance developedbut since that time they have never met  nevertheless paramore enters the room with a certain air of arriving for the evening  tana is answering a question  tana grinning with ingratiation gone to inn for dinnah
be back halfhour
gone since ha' past six
paramore regarding the glasses on the table have they company
tana yes
company
mistah caramel mistah and missays barnes miss kane all stay here
paramore i see
kindly they've been having a spree i see
tana i no un'stan'
paramore they've been having a fling
tana yes they have drink
oh many many many drink
paramore receding delicately from the subject didn't i hear the sounds of music as i approached the house
tanawith a spasmodic giggleyes i play
paramore one of the japanese instruments
he is quite obviously a subscriber to the national geographic magazine
tana i play fluuute japanese fluuute
paramore what song were you playing
one of your japanese melodies
tanahis brow undergoing preposterous contraction i play train song
how you callrailroad song
so call in my countree
like train
it go sooo that mean whistle train start
then go sooo that mean train go
go like that
vera nice song in my countree
children song
paramore it sounded very nice
it is apparent at this point that only a gigantic effort at control restrains tana from rushing upstairs for his post cards including the six made in america
tana i fix highball for gentleman
paramore no thanks
i don't use it
he smiles
tana withdraws into the kitchen leaving the intervening door slightly ajar
from the crevice there suddenly issues again the melody of the japanese train songthis time not a practice surely but a performance a lusty spirited performance  the phone rings tana absorbed in his harmonics gives no heed so paramore takes up the receiver
paramore hello
yes no he's not here now but he'll be back any moment butterworth
hello i didn't quite catch the name hello hello hello
hello
 huh
the phone obstinately refuses to yield up any more sound
paramore replaces the receiver  at this point the taxi motif reenters wafting with it a second young man he carries a suitcase and opens the front door without ringing the bell  maury in the hall oh anthony
yoho
he comes into the large room and sees paramore how do
paramore gazing at him with gathering intensity is thisis this maury noble
maury that's it
he advances smiling and holding out his hand how are you old boy
haven't seen you for years
he has vaguely associated the face with harvard but is not even positive about that
the name if he ever knew it he has long since forgotten
however with a fine sensitiveness and an equally commendable charity paramore recognizes the fact and tactfully relieves the situation
paramore you've forgotten fred paramore
we were both in old unc robert's history class
maury no i haven't unci mean fred
fred wasi mean unc was a great old fellow wasn't he
paramore nodding his head humorously several times great old character
great old character
maury after a short pause yeshe was
where's anthony
paramore the japanese servant told me he was at some inn
having dinner i suppose
maury looking at his watch gone long
paramore i guess so
the japanese told me they'd be back shortly
maury suppose we have a drink
paramore no thanks
i don't use it
he smiles
maury mind if i do
yawning as he helps himself from a bottle what have you been doing since you left college
paramore oh many things
i've led a very active life
knocked about here and there
his tone implies anything front lionstalking to organized crime  maury oh been over to europe
paramore no i haven'tunfortunately
maury i guess we'll all go over before long
paramore do you really think so
maury sure
country's been fed on sensationalism for more than two years
everybody getting restless
want to have some fun
paramore then you don't believe any ideals are at stake
maury nothing of much importance
people want excitement every so often
paramore intently it's very interesting to hear you say that
now i was talking to a man who'd been over there  during the ensuing testament left to be filled in by the reader with such phrases as saw with his own eyes splendid spirit of france and salvation of civilization maury sits with lowered eyelids dispassionately bored  maury at the first available opportunity by the way do you happen to know that there's a german agent in this very house
paramore smiling cautiously are you serious
maury absolutely
feel it my duty to warn you
paramore convinced a governess
maury in a whisper indicating the kitchen with his thumb tana that's not his real name
i understand he constantly gets mail addressed to lieutenant emile tannenbaum
paramore laughing with hearty tolerance you were kidding me
maury i may be accusing him falsely
but you haven't told me what you've been doing
paramore for one thingwriting
maury fiction
paramore no
nonfiction
maury what's that
a sort of literature that's half fiction and half fact
paramore oh i've confined myself to fact
i've been doing a good deal of socialservice work
maury oh
an immediate glow of suspicion leaps into his eyes
it is as though paramore had announced himself as an amateur pickpocket  paramore at present i'm doing service work in stamford
only last week some one told me that anthony patch lived so near
they are interrupted by a clamor outside unmistakable as that of two sexes in conversation and laughter
then there enter the room in a body anthony gloria richard caramel muriel kane rachael barnes and rodman barnes her husband
they surge about maury illogically replying fine
to his general hello
 anthony meanwhile approaches his other guest  anthony well i'll be darned
how are you
mighty glad to see you
paramore it's good to see you anthony
i'm stationed in stamford so i thought i'd run over
roguishly we have to work to beat the devil most of the time so we're entitled to a few hours' vacation
in an agony of concentration anthony tries to recall the name
after a struggle of parturition his memory gives up the fragment fred around which he hastily builds the sentence glad you did fred
meanwhile the slight hush prefatory to an introduction has fallen upon the company maury who could help prefers to look on in malicious enjoyment  anthony in desperation ladies and gentlemen this isthis is fred
muriel with obliging levity hello fred
richard caramel and paramore greet each other intimately by their first names the latter recollecting that dick was one of the men in his class who had never before troubled to speak to him dick fatuously imagines that paramore is some one he has previously met in anthony's house  the three young women go upstairs  maury in an undertone to dick haven't seen muriel since anthony's wedding
dick she's now in her prime
her latest is i'll say so
anthony struggles for a while with paramore and at length attempts to make the conversation general by asking every one to have a drink  maury i've done pretty well on this bottle
i've gone from proof down to distillery
he indicates the words on the label  anthony to paramore never can tell when these two will turn up
said goodby to them one afternoon at five and darned if they didn't appear about two in the morning
a big hired touringcar from new york drove up to the door and out they stepped drunk as lords of course
in an ecstasy of consideration paramore regards the cover of a book which he holds in his hand maury and dick exchange a glance  dick innocently to paramore you work here in town
paramore no i'm in the laird street settlement in stamford
to anthony you have no idea of the amount of poverty in these small connecticut towns
italians and other immigrants
catholics mostly you know so it's very hard to reach them
anthony politely lot of crime
paramore not so much crime as ignorance and dirt
maury that's my theory immediate electrocution of all ignorant and dirty people
i'm all for the criminalsgive color to life
trouble is if you started to punish ignorance you'd have to begin in the first families then you could take up the moving picture people and finally congress and the clergy
paramore smiling uneasily i was speaking of the more fundamental ignoranceof even our language
maury thoughtfully i suppose it is rather hard
can't even keep up with the new poetry
paramore it's only when the settlement work has gone on for months that one realizes how bad things are
as our secretary said to me your fingernails never seem dirty until you wash your hands
of course we're already attracting much attention
maury rudely as your secretary might say if you stuff paper into a grate it'll burn brightly for a moment
at this point gloria freshly tinted and lustful of admiration and entertainment rejoins the party followed by her two friends
for several moments the conversation becomes entirely fragmentary gloria calls anthony aside  gloria please don't drink much anthony
anthony why
gloria because you're so simple when you're drunk
anthony good lord
what's the matter now
gloria after a pause during which her eyes gaze coolly into his several things
in the first place why do you insist on paying for everything
both those men have more money than you
anthony why gloria
they're my guests
gloria that's no reason why you should pay for a bottle of champagne rachael barnes smashed
dick tried to fix that second taxi bill and you wouldn't let him
anthony why gloria  gloria when we have to keep selling bonds to even pay our bills it's time to cut down on excess generosities
moreover i wouldn't be quite so attentive to rachael barnes
her husband doesn't like it any more than i do
anthony why gloria  gloria mimicking him sharply why gloria
but that's happened a little too often this summerwith every pretty woman you meet
it's grown to be a sort of habit and i'm not going to stand it
if you can play around i can too
then as an afterthought by the way this fred person isn't a second joe hull is he
anthony heavens no
he probably came up to get me to wheedle some money out of grandfather for his flock
gloria turns away from a very depressed anthony and returns to her guests  by nine o'clock these can be divided into two classesthose who have been drinking consistently and those who have taken little or nothing
in the second group are the barneses muriel and frederick e
paramore
muriel i wish i could write
i get these ideas but i never seem to be able to put them in words
dick as goliath said he understood how david felt but he couldn't express himself
the remark was immediately adopted for a motto by the philistines
muriel i don't get you
i must be getting stupid in my old age
gloria weaving unsteadily among the company like an exhilarated angel if any one's hungry there's some french pastry on the dining room table
maury can't tolerate those victorian designs it comes in
muriel violently amused i'll say you're tight maury
her bosom is still a pavement that she offers to the hoofs of many passing stallions hoping that their iron shoes may strike even a spark of romance in the darkness   messrs barnes and paramore have been engaged in conversation upon some wholesome subject a subject so wholesome that mr barnes has been trying for several moments to creep into the more tainted air around the central lounge
whether paramore is lingering in the gray house out of politeness or curiosity or in order at some future time to make a sociological report on the decadence of american life is problematical  maury fred i imagined you were very broadminded
paramore i am
muriel me too
i believe one religion's as good as another and everything
paramore there's some good in all religions
muriel i'm a catholic but as i always say i'm not working at it
paramore with a tremendous burst of tolerance the catholic religion is a verya very powerful religion
maury well such a broadminded man should consider the raised plane of sensation and the stimulated optimism contained in this cocktail
paramore taking the drink rather defiantly thanks i'll tryone
maury one
outrageous
here we have a class of 'nineteen ten reunion and you refuse to be even a little pickled
come on
here's a health to king charles here's a health to king charles bring the bowl that you boast  paramore joins in with a hearty voice
maury fill the cup frederick
you know everything's subordinated to nature's purposes with us and her purpose with you is to make you a riproaring tippler
paramore if a fellow can drink like a gentleman  maury what is a gentleman anyway
anthony a man who never has pins under his coat lapel
maury nonsense
a man's social rank is determined by the amount of bread he eats in a sandwich
dick he's a man who prefers the first edition of a book to the last edition of a newspaper
rachael a man who never gives an impersonation of a dopefiend
maury an american who can fool an english butler into thinking he's one
muriel a man who comes from a good family and went to yale or harvard or princeton and has money and dances well and all that
maury at lastthe perfect definition
cardinal newman's is now a back number
paramore i think we ought to look on the question more broadmindedly
was it abraham lincoln who said that a gentleman is one who never inflicts pain
maury it's attributed i believe to general ludendorff
paramore surely you're joking
maury have another drink
paramore i oughtn't to
lowering his voice for maury's ear alone what if i were to tell you this is the third drink i've ever taken in my life
dick starts the phonograph which provokes muriel to rise and sway from side to side her elbows against her ribs her forearms perpendicular to her body and out like fins  muriel oh let's take up the rugs and dance
this suggestion is received by anthony and gloria with interior groans and sickly smiles of acquiescence  muriel come on you lazybones
get up and move the furniture back
dick wait till i finish my drink
maury intent on his purpose toward paramore i'll tell you what
let's each fill one glass drink it off and then we'll dance
a wave of protest which breaks against the rock of maury's insistence  muriel my head is simply going round now
rachael in an undertone to anthony did gloria tell you to stay away from me
anthony confused why certainly not
of course not
rachael smiles at him inscrutably
two years have given her a sort of hard wellgroomed beauty  maury holding up his glass here's to the defeat of democracy and the fall of christianity
muriel now really
she flashes a mockreproachful glance at maury and then drinks  they all drink with varying degrees of difficulty  muriel clear the floor
it seems inevitable that this process is to be gone through so anthony and gloria join in the great moving of tables piling of chairs rolling of carpets and breaking of lamps
when the furniture has been stacked in ugly masses at the sides there appears a space about eight feet square  muriel oh let's have music
maury tana will render the love song of an eye ear nose and throat specialist
amid some confusion due to the fact that tana has retired for the night preparations are made for the performance
the pajamaed japanese flute in hand is wrapped in a comforter and placed in a chair atop one of the tables where he makes a ludicrous and grotesque spectacle paramore is perceptibly drunk and so enraptured with the notion that he increases the effect by simulating funnypaper staggers and even venturing on an occasional hiccough  paramore to gloria want to dance with me
gloria no sir
want to do the swan dance
can you do it
paramore sure
do them all
gloria all right
you start from that side of the room and i'll start from this
muriel let's go
then bedlam creeps screaming out of the bottles tana plunges into the recondite mazes of the train song the plaintive tootle toottoot blending its melancholy cadences with the poor butterfly tinkatink by the blossoms waiting of the phonograph muriel is too weak with laughter to do more than cling desperately to barnes who dancing with the ominous rigidity of an army officer tramps without humor around the small space anthony is trying to hear rachael's whisperwithout attracting gloria's attention  but the grotesque the unbelievable the histrionic incident is about to occur one of those incidents in which life seems set upon the passionate imitation of the lowest forms of literature paramore has been trying to emulate gloria and as the commotion reaches its height he begins to spin round and round more and more dizzilyhe staggers recovers staggers again and then falls in the direction of the hall  almost into the arms of old adam patch whose approach has been rendered inaudible by the pandemonium in the room  adam patch is very white
he leans upon a stick
the man with him is edward shuttleworth and it is he who seizes paramore by the shoulder and deflects the course of his fall away from the venerable philanthropist  the time required for quiet to descend upon the room like a monstrous pall may be estimated at two minutes though for a short period after that the phonograph gags and the notes of the japanese train song dribble from the end of tana's flute
of the nine people only barnes paramore and tana are unaware of the latecomer's identity
of the nine not one is aware that adam patch has that morning made a contribution of fifty thousand dollars to the cause of national prohibition  it is given to paramore to break the gathering silence the high tide of his life's depravity is reached in his incredible remark  paramore crawling rapidly toward the kitchen on his hands and knees i'm not a guest herei work here
again silence fallsso deep now so weighted with intolerably contagious apprehension that rachael gives a nervous little giggle and dick finds himself telling over and over a line from swinburne grotesquely appropriate to the scene  one gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath
 out of the hush the voice of anthony sober and strained saying something to adam patch then this too dies away  shuttleworth passionately your grandfather thought he would motor over to see your house
i phoned from rye and left a message
a series of little gasps emanating apparently from nowhere from no one fall into the next pause anthony is the color of chalk gloria's lips are parted and her level gaze at the old man is tense and frightened
there is not one smile in the room
not one
or does cross patch's drawn mouth tremble slightly open to expose the even rows of his thin teeth
he speaksfive mild and simple words  adam patch we'll go back now shuttleworthand that is all
he turns and assisted by his cane goes out through the hall through the front door and with hellish portentousness his uncertain footsteps crunch on the gravel path under the august moon   retrospect  in this extremity they were like two goldfish in a bowl from which all the water had been drawn they could not even swim across to each other
gloria would be twentysix in may
there was nothing she had said that she wanted except to be young and beautiful for a long time to be gay and happy and to have money and love
she wanted what most women want but she wanted it much more fiercely and passionately
she had been married over two years
at first there had been days of serene understanding rising to ecstasies of proprietorship and pride
alternating with these periods had occurred sporadic hates enduring a short hour and forgetfulnesses lasting no longer than an afternoon
that had been for half a year
then the serenity the content had become less jubilant had become grayvery rarely with the spur of jealousy or forced separation the ancient ecstasies returned the apparent communion of soul and soul the emotional excitement
it was possible for her to hate anthony for as much as a full day to be carelessly incensed at him for as long as a week
recrimination had displaced affection as an indulgence almost as an entertainment and there were nights when they would go to sleep trying to remember who was angry and who should be reserved next morning
and as the second year waned there had entered two new elements
gloria realized that anthony had become capable of utter indifference toward her a temporary indifference more than half lethargic but one from which she could no longer stir him by a whispered word or a certain intimate smile
there were days when her caresses affected him as a sort of suffocation
she was conscious of these things she never entirely admitted them to herself
it was only recently that she perceived that in spite of her adoration of him her jealousy her servitude her pride she fundamentally despised himand her contempt blended indistinguishably with her other emotions all this was her lovethe vital and feminine illusion that had directed itself toward him one april night many months before
on anthony's part she was in spite of these qualifications his sole preoccupation
had he lost her he would have been a broken man wretchedly and sentimentally absorbed in her memory for the remainder of life
he seldom took pleasure in an entire day spent alone with herexcept on occasions he preferred to have a third person with them
there were times when he felt that if he were not left absolutely alone he would go madthere were a few times when he definitely hated her
in his cups he was capable of short attractions toward other women the hithertosuppressed outcroppings of an experimental temperament
that spring that summer they had speculated upon future happinesshow they were to travel from summer land to summer land returning eventually to a gorgeous estate and possible idyllic children then entering diplomacy or politics to accomplish for a while beautiful and important things until finally as a whitehaired beautifully silkily whitehaired couple they were to loll about in serene glory worshipped by the bourgeoisie of the land
these times were to begin when we get our money it was on such dreams rather than on any satisfaction with their increasingly irregular increasingly dissipated life that their hope rested
on gray mornings when the jests of the night before had shrunk to ribaldries without wit or dignity they could after a fashion bring out this batch of common hopes and count them over then smile at each other and repeat by way of clinching the matter the terse yet sincere nietzscheanism of gloria's defiant i don't care
things had been slipping perceptibly
there was the money question increasingly annoying increasingly ominous there was the realization that liquor had become a practical necessity to their amusementnot an uncommon phenomenon in the british aristocracy of a hundred years ago but a somewhat alarming one in a civilization steadily becoming more temperate and more circumspect
moreover both of them seemed vaguely weaker in fibre not so much in what they did as in their subtle reactions to the civilization about them
in gloria had been born something that she had hitherto never neededthe skeleton incomplete but nevertheless unmistakable of her ancient abhorrence a conscience
this admission to herself was coincidental with the slow decline of her physical courage
then on the august morning after adam patch's unexpected call they awoke nauseated and tired dispirited with life capable only of one pervasive emotionfear
panic  well
anthony sat up in bed and looked down at her
the corners of his lips were drooping with depression his voice was strained and hollow
her reply was to raise her hand to her mouth and begin a slow precise nibbling at her finger
we've done it he said after a pause then as she was still silent he became exasperated
why don't you say something
what on earth do you want me to say
what are you thinking
nothing
then stop biting your finger
ensued a short confused discussion of whether or not she had been thinking
it seemed essential to anthony that she should muse aloud upon last night's disaster
her silence was a method of settling the responsibility on him
for her part she saw no necessity for speechthe moment required that she should gnaw at her finger like a nervous child
i've got to fix up this damn mess with my grandfather he said with uneasy conviction
a faint newborn respect was indicated by his use of my grandfather instead of grampa
you can't she affirmed abruptly
you can'tever
he'll never forgive you as long as he lives
perhaps not agreed anthony miserably
stilli might possibly square myself by some sort of reformation and all that sort of thing  he looked sick she interrupted pale as flour
he is sick
i told you that three months ago
i wish he'd died last week
she said petulantly
inconsiderate old fool
neither of them laughed
but just let me say she added quietly the next time i see you acting with any woman like you did with rachael barnes last night i'll leave youjustlikethat i'm simply not going to stand it
anthony quailed
oh don't be absurd he protested
you know there's no woman in the world for me except younone dearest
his attempt at a tender note failed miserablythe more imminent danger stalked back into the foreground
if i went to him suggested anthony and said with appropriate biblical quotations that i'd walked too long in the way of unrighteousness and at last seen the light he broke off and glanced with a whimsical expression at his wife
i wonder what he'd do
i don't know
she was speculating as to whether or not their guests would have the acumen to leave directly after breakfast
not for a week did anthony muster the courage to go to tarrytown
the prospect was revolting and left alone he would have been incapable of making the tripbut if his will had deteriorated in these past three years so had his power to resist urging
gloria compelled him to go
it was all very well to wait a week she said for that would give his grandfather's violent animosity time to coolbut to wait longer would be an errorit would give it a chance to harden
he went in trepidation  and vainly
adam patch was not well said shuttleworth indignantly
positive instructions had been given that no one was to see him
before the exginphysician's vindictive eye anthony's front wilted
he walked out to his taxicab with what was almost a slinkrecovering only a little of his selfrespect as he boarded the train glad to escape boylike to the wonder palaces of consolation that still rose and glittered in his own mind
gloria was scornful when he returned to marietta
why had he not forced his way in
that was what she would have done
between them they drafted a letter to the old man and after considerable revision sent it off
it was half an apology half a manufactured explanation
the letter was not answered
came a day in september a day slashed with alternate sun and rain sun without warmth rain without freshness
on that day they left the gray house which had seen the flower of their love
four trunks and three monstrous crates were piled in the dismantled room where two years before they had sprawled lazily thinking in terms of dreams remote languorous content
the room echoed with emptiness
gloria in a new brown dress edged with fur sat upon a trunk in silence and anthony walked nervously to and fro smoking as they waited for the truck that would take their things to the city
what are those
she demanded pointing to some books piled upon one of the crates
that's my old stamp collection he confessed sheepishly
i forgot to pack it
anthony it's so silly to carry it around
well i was looking through it the day we left the apartment last spring and i decided not to store it
can't you sell it
haven't we enough junk
i'm sorry he said humbly
with a thunderous rattling the truck rolled up to the door
gloria shook her fist defiantly at the four walls
i'm so glad to go
she cried so glad
oh my god how i hate this house
so the brilliant and beautiful lady went up with her husband to new york
on the very train that bore them away they quarrelledher bitter words had the frequency the regularity the inevitability of the stations they passed
don't be cross begged anthony piteously
we've got nothing but each other after all
we haven't even that most of the time cried gloria
when haven't we
a lot of timesbeginning with one occasion on the station platform at redgate
you don't mean to say that  no she interrupted coolly i don't brood over it
it came and wentand when it went it took something with it
she finished abruptly
anthony sat in silence confused depressed
the drab visions of trainside mamaroneck larchmont rye pelham manor succeeded each other with intervals of bleak and shoddy wastes posing ineffectually as country
he found himself remembering how on one summer morning they two had started from new york in search of happiness
they had never expected to find it perhaps yet in itself that quest had been happier than anything he expected forevermore
life it seemed must be a setting up of props around oneotherwise it was disaster
there was no rest no quiet
he had been futile in longing to drift and dream no one drifted except to maelstroms no one dreamed without his dreams becoming fantastic nightmares of indecision and regret
pelham
they had quarrelled in pelham because gloria must drive
and when she set her little foot on the accelerator the car had jumped off spunkily and their two heads had jerked back like marionettes worked by a single string
the bronxthe houses gathering and gleaming in the sun which was falling now through wide refulgent skies and tumbling caravans of light down into the streets
new york he supposed was homethe city of luxury and mystery of preposterous hopes and exotic dreams
here on the outskirts absurd stucco palaces reared themselves in the cool sunset poised for an instant in cool unreality glided off far away succeeded by the mazed confusion of the harlem river
the train moved in through the deepening twilight above and past half a hundred cheerful sweating streets of the upper east side each one passing the car window like the space between the spokes of a gigantic wheel each one with its vigorous colorful revelation of poor children swarming in feverish activity like vivid ants in alleys of red sand
from the tenement windows leaned rotund moonshaped mothers as constellations of this sordid heaven women like dark imperfect jewels women like vegetables women like great bags of abominably dirty laundry
i like these streets observed anthony aloud
i always feel as though it's a performance being staged for me as though the second i've passed they'll all stop leaping and laughing and instead grow very sad remembering how poor they are and retreat with bowed heads into their houses
you often get that effect abroad but seldom in this country
down in a tall busy street he read a dozen jewish names on a line of stores in the door of each stood a dark little man watching the passers from intent eyeseyes gleaming with suspicion with pride with clarity with cupidity with comprehension
new yorkhe could not dissociate it now from the slow upward creep of this peoplethe little stores growing expanding consolidating moving watched over with hawk's eyes and a bee's attention to detailthey slathered out on all sides
it was impressivein perspective it was tremendous
gloria's voice broke in with strange appropriateness upon his thoughts
i wonder where bloeckman's been this summer
the apartment  after the sureties of youth there sets in a period of intense and intolerable complexity
with the sodajerker this period is so short as to be almost negligible
men higher in the scale hold out longer in the attempt to preserve the ultimate niceties of relationship to retain impractical ideas of integrity
but by the late twenties the business has grown too intricate and what has hitherto been imminent and confusing has become gradually remote and dim
routine comes down like twilight on a harsh landscape softening it until it is tolerable
the complexity is too subtle too varied the values are changing utterly with each lesion of vitality it has begun to appear that we can learn nothing from the past with which to face the futureso we cease to be impulsive convincible men interested in what is ethically true by fine margins we substitute rules of conduct for ideas of integrity we value safety above romance we become quite unconsciously pragmatic
it is left to the few to be persistently concerned with the nuances of relationshipsand even this few only in certain hours especially set aside for the task
anthony patch had ceased to be an individual of mental adventure of curiosity and had become an individual of bias and prejudice with a longing to be emotionally undisturbed
this gradual change had taken place through the past several years accelerated by a succession of anxieties preying on his mind
there was first of all the sense of waste always dormant in his heart now awakened by the circumstances of his position
in his moments of insecurity he was haunted by the suggestion that life might be after all significant
in his early twenties the conviction of the futility of effort of the wisdom of abnegation had been confirmed by the philosophies he had admired as well as by his association with maury noble and later with his wife
yet there had been occasionsjust before his first meeting with gloria for example and when his grandfather had suggested that he should go abroad as a war correspondentupon which his dissatisfaction had driven him almost to a positive step
one day just before they left marietta for the last time in carelessly turning over the pages of a harvard alumni bulletin he had found a column which told him what his contemporaries had been about in this six years since graduation
most of them were in business it was true and several were converting the heathen of china or america to a nebulous protestantism but a few he found were working constructively at jobs that were neither sinecures nor routines
there was calvin boyd for instance who though barely out of medical school had discovered a new treatment for typhus had shipped abroad and was mitigating some of the civilization that the great powers had brought to servia there was eugene bronson whose articles in the new democracy were stamping him as a man with ideas transcending both vulgar timeliness and popular hysteria there was a man named daly who had been suspended from the faculty of a righteous university for preaching marxian doctrines in the classroom in art science politics he saw the authentic personalities of his time emergingthere was even severance the quarterback who had given up his life rather neatly and gracefully with the foreign legion on the aisne
he laid down the magazine and thought for a while about these diverse men
in the days of his integrity he would have defended his attitude to the lastan epicurus in nirvana he would have cried that to struggle was to believe to believe was to limit
he would as soon have become a churchgoer because the prospect of immortality gratified him as he would have considered entering the leather business because the intensity of the competition would have kept him from unhappiness
but at present he had no such delicate scruples
this autumn as his twentyninth year began he was inclined to close his mind to many things to avoid prying deeply into motive and first causes and mostly to long passionately for security from the world and from himself
he hated to be alone as has been said he often dreaded being alone with gloria
because of the chasm which his grandfather's visit had opened before him and the consequent revulsion from his late mode of life it was inevitable that he should look around in this suddenly hostile city for the friends and environments that had once seemed the warmest and most secure
his first step was a desperate attempt to get back his old apartment
in the spring of  he had signed a fouryear lease at seventeen hundred a year with an option of renewal
this lease had expired the previous may
when he had first rented the rooms they had been mere potentialities scarcely to be discerned as that but anthony had seen into these potentialities and arranged in the lease that he and the landlord should each spend a certain amount in improvements
rents had gone up in the past four years and last spring when anthony had waived his option the landlord a mr sohenberg had realized that he could get a much bigger price for what was now a prepossessing apartment
accordingly when anthony approached him on the subject in september he was met with sohenberg's offer of a threeyear lease at twentyfive hundred a year
this it seemed to anthony was outrageous
it meant that well over a third of their income would be consumed in rent
in vain he argued that his own money his own ideas on the repartitioning had made the rooms attractive
in vain he offered two thousand dollarstwentytwo hundred though they could ill afford it mr sohenberg was obdurate
it seemed that two other gentlemen were considering it just that sort of an apartment was in demand for the moment and it would scarcely be business to give it to mr patch
besides though he had never mentioned it before several of the other tenants had complained of noise during the previous wintersinging and dancing late at night that sort of thing
internally raging anthony hurried back to the ritz to report his discomfiture to gloria
i can just see you she stormed letting him back you down
what could i say
you could have told him what he was
i wouldn't have stood it
no other man in the world would have stood it
you just let people order you around and cheat you and bully you and take advantage of you as if you were a silly little boy
it's absurd
oh for heaven's sake don't lose your temper
i know anthony but you are such an ass
well possibly
anyway we can't afford that apartment
but we can afford it better than living here at the ritz
you were the one who insisted on coming here
yes because i knew you'd be miserable in a cheap hotel
of course i would
at any rate we've got to find a place to live
how much can we pay
she demanded
well we can pay even his price if we sell more bonds but we agreed last night that until i had gotten something definite to do we  oh i know all that
i asked you how much we can pay out of just our income
they say you ought not to pay more than a fourth
how much is a fourth
one hundred and fifty a month
do you mean to say we've got only six hundred dollars coming in every month
a subdued note crept into her voice
of course
he answered angrily
do you think we've gone on spending more than twelve thousand a year without cutting way into our capital
i knew we'd sold bonds buthave we spent that much a year
how did we
her awe increased
oh i'll look in those careful accountbooks we kept he remarked ironically and then added two rents a good part of the time clothes travelwhy each of those springs in california cost about four thousand dollars
that darn car was an expense from start to finish
and parties and amusements andoh one thing or another
they were both excited now and inordinately depressed
the situation seemed worse in the actual telling gloria than it had when he had first made the discovery himself
you've got to make some money she said suddenly
i know it
and you've got to make another attempt to see your grandfather
i will
when
when we get settled
this eventuality occurred a week later
they rented a small apartment on fiftyseventh street at one hundred and fifty a month
it included bedroom livingroom kitchenette and bath in a thin whitestone apartment house and though the rooms were too small to display anthony's best furniture they were clean new and in a blonde and sanitary way not unattractive
bounds had gone abroad to enlist in the british army and in his place they tolerated rather than enjoyed the services of a gaunt bigboned irishwoman whom gloria loathed because she discussed the glories of sinn fein as she served breakfast
but they vowed they would have no more japanese and english servants were for the present hard to obtain
like bounds the woman prepared only breakfast
their other meals they took at restaurants and hotels
what finally drove anthony posthaste up to tarrytown was an announcement in several new york papers that adam patch the multimillionaire the philanthropist the venerable uplifter was seriously ill and not expected to recover
the kitten  anthony could not see him
the doctors' instructions were that he was to talk to no one said mr shuttleworthwho offered kindly to take any message that anthony might care to intrust with him and deliver it to adam patch when his condition permitted
but by obvious innuendo he confirmed anthony's melancholy inference that the prodigal grandson would be particularly unwelcome at the bedside
at one point in the conversation anthony with gloria's positive instructions in mind made a move as though to brush by the secretary but shuttleworth with a smile squared his brawny shoulders and anthony saw how futile such an attempt would be
miserably intimidated he returned to new york where husband and wife passed a restless week
a little incident that occurred one evening indicated to what tension their nerves were drawn
walking home along a crossstreet after dinner anthony noticed a nightbound cat prowling near a railing
i always have an instinct to kick a cat he said idly
i like them
i yielded to it once
when
oh years ago before i met you
one night between the acts of a show
cold night like this and i was a little tightone of the first times i was ever tight he added
the poor little beggar was looking for a place to sleep i guess and i was in a mean mood so it took my fancy to kick it  oh the poor kitty
cried gloria sincerely moved
inspired with the narrative instinct anthony enlarged on the theme
it was pretty bad he admitted
the poor little beast turned around and looked at me rather plaintively as though hoping i'd pick him up and be kind to himhe was really just a kittenand before he knew it a big foot launched out at him and caught his little back  oh
gloria's cry was full of anguish
it was such a cold night he continued perversely keeping his voice upon a melancholy note
i guess it expected kindness from somebody and it got only pain  he broke off suddenlygloria was sobbing
they had reached home and when they entered the apartment she threw herself upon the lounge crying as though he had struck at her very soul
oh the poor little kitty
she repeated piteously the poor little kitty
so cold  gloria  don't come near me
please don't come near me
you killed the soft little kitty
touched anthony knelt beside her
dear he said
oh gloria darling
it isn't true
i invented itevery word of it
but she would not believe him
there had been something in the details he had chosen to describe that made her cry herself asleep that night for the kitten for anthony for herself for the pain and bitterness and cruelty of all the world
the passing of an american moralist  old adam died on a midnight of late november with a pious compliment to his god on his thin lips
he who had been flattered so much faded out flattering the omnipotent abstraction which he fancied he might have angered in the more lascivious moments of his youth
it was announced that he had arranged some sort of an armistice with the deity the terms of which were not made public though they were thought to have included a large cash payment
all the newspapers printed his biography and two of them ran short editorials on his sterling worth and his part in the drama of industrialism with which he had grown up
they referred guardedly to the reforms he had sponsored and financed
the memories of comstock and cato the censor were resuscitated and paraded like gaunt ghosts through the columns
every newspaper remarked that he was survived by a single grandson anthony comstock patch of new york
the burial took place in the family plot at tarrytown
anthony and gloria rode in the first carriage too worried to feel grotesque both trying desperately to glean presage of fortune from the faces of retainers who had been with him at the end
they waited a frantic week for decency and then having received no notification of any kind anthony called up his grandfather's lawyer
mr brett was not he was expected back in an hour
anthony left his telephone number
it was the last day of november cool and crackling outside with a lustreless sun peering bleakly in at the windows
while they waited for the call ostensibly engaged in reading the atmosphere within and without seemed pervaded with a deliberate rendition of the pathetic fallacy
after an interminable while the bell jingled and anthony starting violently took up the receiver
hello  his voice was strained and hollow
yesi did leave word
who is this please

yes why it was about the estate
naturally i'm interested and i've received no word about the reading of the willi thought you might not have my address what

yes   gloria fell on her knees
the intervals between anthony's speeches were like tourniquets winding on her heart
she found herself helplessly twisting the large buttons from a velvet cushion
then  that'sthat's very very oddthat's very oddthat's very odd
not even anyahmention or anyahreason
his voice sounded faint and far away
she uttered a little sound half gasp half cry
yes i'll see all right thanks  thanks  the phone clicked
her eyes looking along the floor saw his feet cut the pattern of a patch of sunlight on the carpet
she arose and faced him with a gray level glance just as his arms folded about her
my dearest he whispered huskily
he did it god damn him
next day  who are the heirs
asked mr haight
you see when you can tell me so little about it  mr haight was tall and bent and beetlebrowed
he had been recommended to anthony as an astute and tenacious lawyer
i only know vaguely answered anthony
a man named shuttleworth who was a sort of pet of his has the whole thing in charge as administrator or trustee or somethingall except the direct bequests to charity and the provisions for servants and for those two cousins in idaho
how distant are the cousins
oh third or fourth anyway
i never even heard of them
mr haight nodded comprehensively
and you want to contest a provision of the will
i guess so admitted anthony helplessly
i want to do what sounds most hopefulthat's what i want you to tell me
you want them to refuse probate to the will
anthony shook his head
you've got me
i haven't any idea what 'probate' is
i want a share of the estate
suppose you tell me some more details
for instance do you know why the testator disinherited you
whyyes began anthony
you see he was always a sucker for moral reform and all that  i know interjected mr haight humorlessly  
and i don't suppose he ever thought i was much good
i didn't go into business you see
but i feel certain that up to last summer i was one of the beneficiaries
we had a house out in marietta and one night grandfather got the notion he'd come over and see us
it just happened that there was a rather gay party going on and he arrived without any warning
well he took one look he and this fellow shuttleworth and then turned around and tore right back to tarrytown
after that he never answered my letters or even let me see him
he was a prohibitionist wasn't he
he was everythingregular religious maniac
how long before his death was the will made that disinherited you
recentlyi mean since august
and you think that the direct reason for his not leaving you the majority of the estate was his displeasure with your recent actions
yes
mr haight considered
upon what grounds was anthony thinking of contesting the will
why isn't there something about evil influence
undue influence is one groundbut it's the most difficult
you would have to show that such pressure was brought to bear so that the deceased was in a condition where he disposed of his property contrary to his intentions  well suppose this fellow shuttleworth dragged him over to marietta just when he thought some sort of a celebration was probably going on
that wouldn't have any bearing on the case
there's a strong division between advice and influence
you'd have to prove that the secretary had a sinister intention
i'd suggest some other grounds
a will is automatically refused probate in case of insanity drunkennesshere anthony smiledor feeblemindedness through premature old age
but objected anthony his private physician being one of the beneficiaries would testify that he wasn't feebleminded
and he wasn't
as a matter of fact he probably did just what he intended to with his moneyit was perfectly consistent with everything he'd ever done in his life  well you see feeblemindedness is a great deal like undue influenceit implies that the property wasn't disposed of as originally intended
the most common ground is duressphysical pressure
anthony shook his head
not much chance on that i'm afraid
undue influence sounds best to me
after more discussion so technical as to be largely unintelligible to anthony he retained mr haight as counsel
the lawyer proposed an interview with shuttleworth who jointly with wilson hiemer and hardy was executor of the will
anthony was to come back later in the week
it transpired that the estate consisted of approximately forty million dollars
the largest bequest to an individual was of one million to edward shuttleworth who received in addition thirty thousand a year salary as administrator of the thirtymilliondollar trust fund left to be doled out to various charities and reform societies practically at his own discretion
the remaining nine millions were proportioned among the two cousins in idaho and about twentyfive other beneficiaries friends secretaries servants and employees who had at one time or another earned the seal of adam patch's approval
at the end of another fortnight mr haight on a retainer's fee of fifteen thousand dollars had begun preparations for contesting the will
the winter of discontent  before they had been two months in the little apartment on fiftyseventh street it had assumed for both of them the same indefinable but almost material taint that had impregnated the gray house in marietta
there was the odor of tobacco alwaysboth of them smoked incessantly it was in their clothes their blankets the curtains and the ashlittered carpets
added to this was the wretched aura of stale wine with its inevitable suggestion of beauty gone foul and revelry remembered in disgust
about a particular set of glass goblets on the sideboard the odor was particularly noticeable and in the main room the mahogany table was ringed with white circles where glasses had been set down upon it
there had been many partiespeople broke things people became sick in gloria's bathroom people spilled wine people made unbelievable messes of the kitchenette
these things were a regular part of their existence
despite the resolutions of many mondays it was tacitly understood as the week end approached that it should be observed with some sort of unholy excitement
when saturday came they would not discuss the matter but would call up this person or that from among their circle of sufficiently irresponsible friends and suggest a rendezvous
only after the friends had gathered and anthony had set out decanters would he murmur casually i guess i'll have just one highball myself  then they were off for two daysrealizing on a wintry dawn that they had been the noisiest and most conspicuous members of the noisiest and most conspicuous party at the boul' mich' or the club rame or at other resorts much less particular about the hilarity of their clientle
they would find that they had somehow squandered eighty or ninety dollars how they never knew they customarily attributed it to the general penury of the friends who had accompanied them
it began to be not unusual for the more sincere of their friends to remonstrate with them in the very course of a party and to predict a sombre end for them in the loss of gloria's looks and anthony's constitution
the story of the summarily interrupted revel in marietta had of course leaked out in detailmuriel doesn't mean to tell every one she knows said gloria to anthony but she thinks every one she tells is the only one she's going to telland diaphanously veiled the tale had been given a conspicuous place in town tattle
when the terms of adam patch's will were made public and the newspapers printed items concerning anthony's suit the story was beautifully rounded outto anthony's infinite disparagement
they began to hear rumors about themselves from all quarters rumors founded usually on a soupcon of truth but overlaid with preposterous and sinister detail
outwardly they showed no signs of deterioration
gloria at twentysix was still the gloria of twenty her complexion a fresh damp setting for her candid eyes her hair still a childish glory darkening slowly from corn color to a deep russet gold her slender body suggesting ever a nymph running and dancing through orphic groves
masculine eyes dozens of them followed her with a fascinated stare when she walked through a hotel lobby or down the aisle of a theatre
men asked to be introduced to her fell into prolonged states of sincere admiration made definite love to herfor she was still a thing of exquisite and unbelievable beauty
and for his part anthony had rather gained than lost in appearance his face had taken on a certain intangible air of tragedy romantically contrasted with his trim and immaculate person
early in the winter when all conversation turned on the probability of america's going into the war when anthony was making a desperate and sincere attempt to write muriel kane arrived in new york and came immediately to see them
like gloria she seemed never to change
she knew the latest slang danced the latest dances and talked of the latest songs and plays with all the fervor of her first season as a new york drifter
her coyness was eternally new eternally ineffectual her clothes were extreme her black hair was bobbed now like gloria's
i've come up for the midwinter prom at new haven she announced imparting her delightful secret
though she must have been older then than any of the boys in college she managed always to secure some sort of invitation imagining vaguely that at the next party would occur the flirtation which was to end at the romantic altar
where've you been
inquired anthony unfailingly amused
i've been at hot springs
it's been slick and peppy this fallmore men  are you in love muriel
what do you mean 'love'
this was the rhetorical question of the year
i'm going to tell you something she said switching the subject abruptly
i suppose it's none of my business but i think it's time for you two to settle down
why we are settled down
yes you are
she scoffed archly
everywhere i go i hear stories of your escapades
let me tell you i have an awful time sticking up for you
you needn't bother said gloria coldly
now gloria she protested you know i'm one of your best friends
gloria was silent
muriel continued  it's not so much the idea of a woman drinking but gloria's so pretty and so many people know her by sight all around that it's naturally conspicuous  what have you heard recently
demanded gloria her dignity going down before her curiosity
well for instance that that party in marietta killed anthony's grandfather
instantly husband and wife were tense with annoyance
why i think that's outrageous
that's what they say persisted muriel stubbornly
anthony paced the room
it's preposterous
he declared
the very people we take on parties shout the story around as a great jokeand eventually it gets back to us in some such form as this
gloria began running her finger through a stray reddish curl
muriel licked her veil as she considered her next remark
you ought to have a baby
gloria looked up wearily
we can't afford it
all the people in the slums have them said muriel triumphantly
anthony and gloria exchanged a smile
they had reached the stage of violent quarrels that were never made up quarrels that smouldered and broke out again at intervals or died away from sheer indifferencebut this visit of muriel's drew them temporarily together
when the discomfort under which they were living was remarked upon by a third party it gave them the impetus to face this hostile world together
it was very seldom now that the impulse toward reunion sprang from within
anthony found himself associating his own existence with that of the apartment's night elevator man a pale scraggly bearded person of about sixty with an air of being somewhat above his station
it was probably because of this quality that he had secured the position it made him a pathetic and memorable figure of failure
anthony recollected without humor a hoary jest about the elevator man's career being a matter of ups and downsit was at any rate an enclosed life of infinite dreariness
each time anthony stepped into the car he waited breathlessly for the old man's well i guess we're going to have some sunshine today
anthony thought how little rain or sunshine he would enjoy shut into that close little cage in the smokecolored windowless hall
a darkling figure he attained tragedy in leaving the life that had used him so shabbily
three young gunmen came in one night tied him up and left him on a pile of coal in the cellar while they went through the trunk room
when the janitor found him next morning he had collapsed from chill
he died of pneumonia four days later
he was replaced by a glib martinique negro with an incongruous british accent and a tendency to be surly whom anthony detested
the passing of the old man had approximately the same effect on him that the kitten story had had on gloria
he was reminded of the cruelty of all life and in consequence of the increasing bitterness of his own
he was writingand in earnest at last
he had gone to dick and listened for a tense hour to an elucidation of those minutiae of procedure which hitherto he had rather scornfully looked down upon
he needed money immediatelyhe was selling bonds every month to pay their bills
dick was frank and explicit  so far as articles on literary subjects in these obscure magazines go you couldn't make enough to pay your rent
of course if a man has the gift of humor or a chance at a big biography or some specialized knowledge he may strike it rich
but for you fiction's the only thing
you say you need money right away
i certainly do
well it'd be a year and a half before you'd make any money out of a novel
try some popular short stories
and by the way unless they're exceptionally brilliant they have to be cheerful and on the side of the heaviest artillery to make you any money
anthony thought of dick's recent output which had been appearing in a wellknown monthly
it was concerned chiefly with the preposterous actions of a class of sawdust effigies who one was assured were new york society people and it turned as a rule upon questions of the heroine's technical purity with mocksociological overtones about the mad antics of the four hundred
but your stories exclaimed anthony aloud almost involuntarily
oh that's different dick asserted astoundingly
i have a reputation you see so i'm expected to deal with strong themes
anthony gave an interior start realizing with this remark how much richard caramel had fallen off
did he actually think that these amazing latter productions were as good as his first novel
anthony went back to the apartment and set to work
he found that the business of optimism was no mean task
after half a dozen futile starts he went to the public library and for a week investigated the files of a popular magazine
then better equipped he accomplished his first story the dictaphone of fate
it was founded upon one of his few remaining impressions of that six weeks in wall street the year before
it purported to be the sunny tale of an office boy who quite by accident hummed a wonderful melody into the dictaphone
the cylinder was discovered by the boss's brother a wellknown producer of musical comedyand then immediately lost
the body of the story was concerned with the pursuit of the missing cylinder and the eventual marriage of the noble office boy now a successful composer to miss rooney the virtuous stenographer who was half joan of arc and half florence nightingale
he had gathered that this was what the magazines wanted
he offered in his protagonists the customary denizens of the pinkandblue literary world immersing them in a saccharine plot that would offend not a single stomach in marietta
he had it typed in double spacethis last as advised by a booklet success as a writer made easy by r meggs widdlestien which assured the ambitious plumber of the futility of perspiration since after a sixlesson course he could make at least a thousand dollars a month
after reading it to a bored gloria and coaxing from her the immemorial remark that it was better than a lot of stuff that gets published he satirically affixed the nom de plume of gilles de sade enclosed the proper return envelope and sent it off
following the gigantic labor of conception he decided to wait until he heard from the first story before beginning another
dick had told him that he might get as much as two hundred dollars
if by any chance it did happen to be unsuited the editor's letter would no doubt give him an idea of what changes should be made
it is without question the most abominable piece of writing in existence said anthony
the editor quite conceivably agreed with him
he returned the manuscript with a rejection slip
anthony sent it off elsewhere and began another story
the second one was called the little open doors it was written in three days
it concerned the occult an estranged couple were brought together by a medium in a vaudeville show
there were six altogether six wretched and pitiable efforts to write down by a man who had never before made a consistent effort to write at all
not one of them contained a spark of vitality and their total yield of grace and felicity was less than that of an average newspaper column
during their circulation they collected all told thirtyone rejection slips headstones for the packages that he would find lying like dead bodies at his door
in midjanuary gloria's father died and they went again to kansas citya miserable trip for gloria brooded interminably not upon her father's death but on her mother's
russel gilbert's affairs having been cleared up they came into possession of about three thousand dollars and a great amount of furniture
this was in storage for he had spent his last days in a small hotel
it was due to his death that anthony made a new discovery concerning gloria
on the journey east she disclosed herself astonishingly as a bilphist
why gloria he cried you don't mean to tell me you believe that stuff
well she said defiantly why not
because it'sit's fantastic
you know that in every sense of the word you're an agnostic
you'd laugh at any orthodox form of christianityand then you come out with the statement that you believe in some silly rule of reincarnation
what if i do
i've heard you and maury and every one else for whose intellect i have the slightest respect agree that life as it appears is utterly meaningless
but it's always seemed to me that if i were unconsciously learning something here it might not be so meaningless
you're not learning anythingyou're just getting tired
and if you must have a faith to soften things take up one that appeals to the reason of some one beside a lot of hysterical women
a person like you oughtn't to accept anything unless it's decently demonstrable
i don't care about truth
i want some happiness
well if you've got a decent mind the second has got to be qualified by the first
any simple soul can delude himself with mental garbage
i don't care she held out stoutly and what's more i'm not propounding any doctrine
the argument faded off but reoccurred to anthony several times thereafter
it was disturbing to find this old belief evidently assimilated from her mother inserting itself again under its immemorial disguise as an innate idea
they reached new york in march after an expensive and illadvised week spent in hot springs and anthony resumed his abortive attempts at fiction
as it became plainer to both of them that escape did not lie in the way of popular literature there was a further slipping of their mutual confidence and courage
a complicated struggle went on incessantly between them
all efforts to keep down expenses died away from sheer inertia and by march they were again using any pretext as an excuse for a party
with an assumption of recklessness gloria tossed out the suggestion that they should take all their money and go on a real spree while it lastedanything seemed better than to see it go in unsatisfactory driblets
gloria you want parties as much as i do
it doesn't matter about me
everything i do is in accordance with my ideas to use every minute of these years when i'm young in having the best time i possibly can
how about after that
after that i won't care
yes you will
well i maybut i won't be able to do anything about it
and i'll have had my good time
you'll be the same then
after a fashion we have had our good time raised the devil and we're in the state of paying for it
nevertheless the money kept going
there would be two days of gaiety two days of morosenessan endless almost invariable round
the sharp pullups when they occurred resulted usually in a spurt of work for anthony while gloria nervous and bored remained in bed or else chewed abstractedly at her fingers
after a day or so of this they would make an engagement and thenoh what did it matter
this night this glow the cessation of anxiety and the sense that if living was not purposeful it was at any rate essentially romantic
wine gave a sort of gallantry to their own failure
meanwhile the suit progressed slowly with interminable examinations of witnesses and marshallings of evidence
the preliminary proceedings of settling the estate were finished
mr haight saw no reason why the case should not come up for trial before summer
bloeckman appeared in new york late in march he had been in england for nearly a year on matters concerned with films par excellence
the process of general refinement was still in progressalways he dressed a little better his intonation was mellower and in his manner there was perceptibly more assurance that the fine things of the world were his by a natural and inalienable right
he called at the apartment remained only an hour during which he talked chiefly of the war and left telling them he was coming again
on his second visit anthony was not at home but an absorbed and excited gloria greeted her husband later in the afternoon
anthony she began would you still object if i went in the movies
his whole heart hardened against the idea
as she seemed to recede from him if only in threat her presence became again not so much precious as desperately necessary
oh gloria
blockhead said he'd put me inonly if i'm ever going to do anything i'll have to start now
they only want young women
think of the money anthony
for youyes
but how about me
don't you know that anything i have is yours too
it's such a hell of a career
he burst out the moral the infinitely circumspect anthony and such a hell of a bunch
and i'm so utterly tired of that fellow bloeckman coming here and interfering
i hate theatrical things
it isn't theatrical
it's utterly different
what am i supposed to do
chase you all over the country
live on your money
then make some yourself
the conversation developed into one of the most violent quarrels they had ever had
after the ensuing reconciliation and the inevitable period of moral inertia she realized that he had taken the life out of the project
neither of them ever mentioned the probability that bloeckman was by no means disinterested but they both knew that it lay back of anthony's objection
in april war was declared with germany
wilson and his cabineta cabinet that in its lack of distinction was strangely reminiscent of the twelve apostleslet loose the carefully starved dogs of war and the press began to whoop hysterically against the sinister morals sinister philosophy and sinister music produced by the teutonic temperament
those who fancied themselves particularly broadminded made the exquisite distinction that it was only the german government which aroused them to hysteria the rest were worked up to a condition of retching indecency
any song which contained the word mother and the word kaiser was assured of a tremendous success
at last every one had something to talk aboutand almost every one fully enjoyed it as though they had been cast for parts in a sombre and romantic play
anthony maury and dick sent in their applications for officers' trainingcamps and the two latter went about feeling strangely exalted and reproachless they chattered to each other like college boys of war's being the one excuse for and justification of the aristocrat and conjured up an impossible caste of officers to be composed it appeared chiefly of the more attractive alumni of three or four eastern colleges
it seemed to gloria that in this huge red light streaming across the nation even anthony took on a new glamour
the tenth infantry arriving in new york from panama were escorted from saloon to saloon by patriotic citizens to their great bewilderment
west pointers began to be noticed for the first time in years and the general impression was that everything was glorious but not half so glorious as it was going to be pretty soon and that everybody was a fine fellow and every race a great racealways excepting the germansand in every strata of society outcasts and scapegoats had but to appear in uniform to be forgiven cheered and wept over by relatives exfriends and utter strangers
unfortunately a small and precise doctor decided that there was something the matter with anthony's bloodpressure
he could not conscientiously pass him for an officers' trainingcamp
the broken lute  their third anniversary passed uncelebrated unnoticed
the season warmed in thaw melted into hotter summer simmered and boiled away
in july the will was offered for probate and upon the contestation was assigned by the surrogate to trial term for trial
the matter was prolonged into septemberthere was difficulty in empanelling an unbiassed jury because of the moral sentiments involved
to anthony's disappointment a verdict was finally returned in favor of the testator whereupon mr haight caused a notice of appeal to be served upon edward shuttleworth
as the summer waned anthony and gloria talked of the things they were to do when the money was theirs and of the places they were to go to after the war when they would agree on things again for both of them looked forward to a time when love springing like the phoenix from its own ashes should be born again in its mysterious and unfathomable haunts
he was drafted early in the fall and the examining doctor made no mention of low bloodpressure
it was all very purposeless and sad when anthony told gloria one night that he wanted above all things to be killed
but as always they were sorry for each other for the wrong things at the wrong times
they decided that for the present she was not to go with him to the southern camp where his contingent was ordered
she would remain in new york to use the apartment to save money and to watch the progress of the casewhich was pending now in the appellate division of which the calendar mr haight told them was far behind
almost their last conversation was a senseless quarrel about the proper division of the incomeat a word either would have given it all to the other
it was typical of the muddle and confusion of their lives that on the october night when anthony reported at the grand central station for the journey to camp she arrived only in time to catch his eye over the anxious heads of a gathered crowd
through the dark light of the enclosed trainsheds their glances stretched across a hysterical area foul with yellow sobbing and the smells of poor women
they must have pondered upon what they had done to one another and each must have accused himself of drawing this sombre pattern through which they were tracing tragically and obscurely
at the last they were too far away for either to see the other's tears
book three     chapter i   a matter of civilization  at a frantic command from some invisible source anthony groped his way inside
he was thinking that for the first time in more than three years he was to remain longer than a night away from gloria
the finality of it appealed to him drearily
it was his clean and lovely girl that he was leaving
they had arrived he thought at the most practical financial settlement she was to have three hundred and seventyfive dollars a monthnot too much considering that over half of that would go in rentand he was taking fifty to supplement his pay
he saw no need for more food clothes and quarters would be providedthere were no social obligations for a private
the car was crowded and already thick with breath
it was one of the type known as tourist cars a sort of brummagem pullman with a bare floor and straw seats that needed cleaning
nevertheless anthony greeted it with relief
he had vaguely expected that the trip south would be made in a freightcar in one end of which would stand eight horses and in the other forty men
he had heard the hommes  chevaux  story so often that it had become confused and ominous
as he rocked down the aisle with his barrackbag slung at his shoulder like a monstrous blue sausage he saw no vacant seats but after a moment his eye fell on a single space at present occupied by the feet of a short swarthy sicilian who with his hat drawn over his eyes hunched defiantly in the corner
as anthony stopped beside him he stared up with a scowl evidently intended to be intimidating he must have adopted it as a defense against this entire gigantic equation
at anthony's sharp that seat taken
he very slowly lifted the feet as though they were a breakable package and placed them with some care upon the floor
his eyes remained on anthony who meanwhile sat down and unbuttoned the uniform coat issued him at camp upton the day before
it chafed him under the arms
before anthony could scrutinize the other occupants of the section a young second lieutenant blew in at the upper end of the car and wafted airily down the aisle announcing in a voice of appalling acerbity  there will be no smoking in this car
no smoking
don't smoke men in this car
as he sailed out at the other end a dozen little clouds of expostulation arose on all sides
oh cripe
jeese
no smokin'
hey come back here fella
what's 'ee idea
two or three cigarettes were shot out through the open windows
others were retained inside though kept sketchily away from view
from here and there in accents of bravado of mockery of submissive humor a few remarks were dropped that soon melted into the listless and pervasive silence
the fourth occupant of anthony's section spoke up suddenly
g'by liberty he said sullenly
g'by everything except bein' an officer's dog
anthony looked at him
he was a tall irishman with an expression moulded of indifference and utter disdain
his eyes fell on anthony as though he expected an answer and then upon the others
receiving only a defiant stare from the italian he groaned and spat noisily on the floor by way of a dignified transition back into taciturnity
a few minutes later the door opened again and the second lieutenant was borne in upon his customary official zephyr this time singing out a different tiding  all right men smoke if you want to
my mistake men
it's all right men
go on and smokemy mistake
this time anthony had a good look at him
he was young thin already faded he was like his own mustache he was like a great piece of shiny straw
his chin receded faintly this was offset by a magnificent and unconvincing scowl a scowl that anthony was to connect with the faces of many young officers during the ensuing year
immediately every one smokedwhether they had previously desired to or not
anthony's cigarette contributed to the hazy oxidation which seemed to roll back and forth in opalescent clouds with every motion of the train
the conversation which had lapsed between the two impressive visits of the young officer now revived tepidly the men across the aisle began making clumsy experiments with their straw seats' capacity for comparative comfort two card games halfheartedly begun soon drew several spectators to sitting positions on the arms of seats
in a few minutes anthony became aware of a persistently obnoxious soundthe small defiant sicilian had fallen audibly asleep
it was wearisome to contemplate that animate protoplasm reasonable by courtesy only shut up in a car by an incomprehensible civilization taken somewhere to do a vague something without aim or significance or consequence
anthony sighed opened a newspaper which he had no recollection of buying and began to read by the dim yellow light
ten o'clock bumped stuffily into eleven the hours clogged and caught and slowed down
amazingly the train halted along the dark countryside from time to time indulging in short deceitful movements backward or forward and whistling harsh paeans into the high october night
having read his newspaper through editorials cartoons and warpoems his eye fell on a halfcolumn headed shakespeareville kansas
it seemed that the shakespeareville chamber of commerce had recently held an enthusiastic debate as to whether the american soldiers should be known as sammies or battling christians
the thought gagged him
he dropped the newspaper yawned and let his mind drift off at a tangent
he wondered why gloria had been late
it seemed so long ago alreadyhe had a pang of illusive loneliness
he tried to imagine from what angle she would regard her new position what place in her considerations he would continue to hold
the thought acted as a further depressanthe opened his paper and began to read again
the members of the chamber of commerce in shakespeareville had decided upon liberty lads
for two nights and two days they rattled southward making mysterious inexplicable stops in what were apparently arid wastes and then rushing through large cities with a pompous air of hurry
the whimsicalities of this train foreshadowed for anthony the whimsicalities of all army administration
in the arid wastes they were served from the baggagecar with beans and bacon that at first he was unable to eathe dined scantily on some milk chocolate distributed by a village canteen
but on the second day the baggagecar's output began to appear surprisingly palatable
on the third morning the rumor was passed along that within the hour they would arrive at their destination camp hooker
it had become intolerably hot in the car and the men were all in shirt sleeves
the sun came in through the windows a tired and ancient sun yellow as parchment and stretched out of shape in transit
it tried to enter in triumphant squares and produced only warped splotchesbut it was appallingly steady so much so that it disturbed anthony not to be the pivot of all the inconsequential sawmills and trees and telegraph poles that were turning around him so fast
outside it played its heavy tremolo over olive roads and fallow cottonfields back of which ran a ragged line of woods broken with eminences of gray rock
the foreground was dotted sparsely with wretched illpatched shanties among which there would flash by now and then a specimen of the languid yokelry of south carolina or else a strolling darky with sullen and bewildered eyes
then the woods moved off and they rolled into a broad space like the baked top of a gigantic cake sugared with an infinity of tents arranged in geometric figures over its surface
the train came to an uncertain stop and the sun and the poles and the trees faded and his universe rocked itself slowly back to its old usualness with anthony patch in the centre
as the men weary and perspiring crowded out of the car he smelt that unforgetable aroma that impregnates all permanent campsthe odor of garbage
camp hooker was an astonishing and spectacular growth suggesting a mining town in the second week
it was a thing of wooden shacks and whitishgray tents connected by a pattern of roads with hard tan drillgrounds fringed with trees
here and there stood green ymca
houses unpromising oases with their muggy odor of wet flannels and closed telephoneboothsand across from each of them there was usually a canteen swarming with life presided over indolently by an officer who with the aid of a sidecar usually managed to make his detail a pleasant and chatty sinecure
up and down the dusty roads sped the soldiers of the quartermaster corps also in sidecars
up and down drove the generals in their government automobiles stopping now and then to bring unalert details to attention to frown heavily upon captains marching at the heads of companies to set the pompous pace in that gorgeous game of showing off which was taking place triumphantly over the entire area
the first week after the arrival of anthony's draft was filled with a series of interminable inoculations and physical examinations and with the preliminary drilling
the days left him desperately tired
he had been issued the wrong size shoes by a popular easygoing supplysergeant and in consequence his feet were so swollen that the last hours of the afternoon were an acute torture
for the first time in his life he could throw himself down on his cot between dinner and afternoon drillcall and seeming to sink with each moment deeper into a bottomless bed drop off immediately to sleep while the noise and laughter around him faded to a pleasant drone of drowsy summer sound
in the morning he awoke stiff and aching hollow as a ghost and hurried forth to meet the other ghostly figures who swarmed in the wan company streets while a harsh bugle shrieked and spluttered at the gray heavens
he was in a skeleton infantry company of about a hundred men
after the invariable breakfast of fatty bacon cold toast and cereal the entire hundred would rush for the latrines which however wellpoliced seemed always intolerable like the lavatories in cheap hotels
out on the field then in ragged orderthe lame man on his left grotesquely marring anthony's listless efforts to keep in step the platoon sergeants either showing off violently to impress the officers and recruits or else quietly lurking in close to the line of march avoiding both labor and unnecessary visibility
when they reached the field work began immediatelythey peeled off their shirts for calisthenics
this was the only part of the day that anthony enjoyed
lieutenant kretching who presided at the antics was sinewy and muscular and anthony followed his movements faithfully with a feeling that he was doing something of positive value to himself
the other officers and sergeants walked about among the men with the malice of schoolboys grouping here and there around some unfortunate who lacked muscular control giving him confused instructions and commands
when they discovered a particularly forlorn illnourished specimen they would linger the full halfhour making cutting remarks and snickering among themselves
one little officer named hopkins who had been a sergeant in the regular army was particularly annoying
he took the war as a gift of revenge from the high gods to himself and the constant burden of his harangues was that these rookies did not appreciate the full gravity and responsibility of the service
he considered that by a combination of foresight and dauntless efficiency he had raised himself to his current magnificence
he aped the particular tyrannies of every officer under whom he had served in times gone by
his frown was frozen on his browbefore giving a private a pass to go to town he would ponderously weigh the effect of such an absence upon the company the army and the welfare of the military profession the world over
lieutenant kretching blond dull and phlegmatic introduced anthony ponderously to the problems of attention right face about face and at ease
his principal defect was his forgetfulness
he often kept the company straining and aching at attention for five minutes while he stood out in front and explained a new movementas a result only the men in the centre knew what it was all aboutthose on both flanks had been too emphatically impressed with the necessity of staring straight ahead
the drill continued until noon
it consisted of stressing a succession of infinitely remote details and though anthony perceived that this was consistent with the logic of war it none the less irritated him
that the same faulty bloodpressure which would have been indecent in an officer did not interfere with the duties of a private was a preposterous incongruity
sometimes after listening to a sustained invective concerned with a dull and on the face of it absurd subject known as military courtesy he suspected that the dim purpose of the war was to let the regular army officersmen with the mentality and aspirations of schoolboyshave their fling with some real slaughter
he was being grotesquely sacrificed to the twentyyear patience of a hopkins
of his three tentmatesa flatfaced conscientious objector from tennessee a big scared pole and the disdainful celt whom he had sat beside on the trainthe two former spent the evenings in writing eternal letters home while the irishman sat in the tent door whistling over and over to himself half a dozen shrill and monotonous birdcalls
it was rather to avoid an hour of their company than with any hope of diversion that when the quarantine was lifted at the end of the week he went into town
he caught one of the swarm of jitneys that overran the camp each evening and in half an hour was set down in front of the stonewall hotel on the hot and drowsy main street
under the gathering twilight the town was unexpectedly attractive
the sidewalks were peopled by vividly dressed overpainted girls who chattered volubly in low lazy voices by dozens of taxidrivers who assailed passing officers with take y' anywheh lieutenant and by an intermittent procession of ragged shuffling subservient negroes
anthony loitering along through the warm dusk felt for the first time in years the slow erotic breath of the south imminent in the hot softness of the air in the pervasive lull of thought and time
he had gone about a block when he was arrested suddenly by a harsh command at his elbow
haven't you been taught to salute officers
he looked dumbly at the man who addressed him a stout blackhaired captain who fixed him menacingly with brown popeyes
come to attention the words were literally thundered
a few pedestrians near by stopped and stared
a softeyed girl in a lilac dress tittered to her companion
anthony came to attention
what's your regiment and company
anthony told him
after this when you pass an officer on the street you straighten up and salute
all right
say 'yes sir'
yes sir
the stout officer grunted turned sharply and marched down the street
after a moment anthony moved on the town was no longer indolent and exotic the magic was suddenly gone out of the dusk
his eyes were turned precipitately inward upon the indignity of his position
he hated that officer every officerlife was unendurable
after he had gone half a block he realized that the girl in the lilac dress who had giggled at his discomfiture was walking with her friend about ten paces ahead of him
several times she had turned and stared at anthony with cheerful laughter in the large eyes that seemed the same color as her gown
at the corner she and her companion visibly slackened their pacehe must make his choice between joining them and passing obliviously by
he passed hesitated then slowed down
in a moment the pair were abreast of him again dissolved in laughter nownot such strident mirth as he would have expected in the north from actresses in this familiar comedy but a soft low rippling like the overflow from some subtle joke into which he had inadvertently blundered
how do you do
he said
her eyes were soft as shadows
were they violet or was it their blue darkness mingling with the gray hues of dusk
pleasant evening ventured anthony uncertainly
sure is said the second girl
hasn't been a very pleasant evening for you sighed the girl in lilac
her voice seemed as much a part of the night as the drowsy breeze stirring the wide brim of her hat
he had to have a chance to show off said anthony with a scornful laugh
reckon so she agreed
they turned the corner and moved lackadaisically up a side street as if following a drifting cable to which they were attached
in this town it seemed entirely natural to turn corners like that it seemed natural to be bound nowhere in particular to be thinking nothing
the side street was dark a sudden offshoot into a district of wild rose hedges and little quiet houses set far back from the street
where're you going
he inquired politely
just goin'
the answer was an apology a question an explanation
can i stroll along with you
reckon so
it was an advantage that her accent was different
he could not have determined the social status of a southerner from her talkin new york a girl of a lower class would have been raucous unendurableexcept through the rosy spectacles of intoxication
dark was creeping down
talking littleanthony in careless casual questions the other two with provincial economy of phrase and burdenthey sauntered past another corner and another
in the middle of a block they stopped beneath a lamppost
i live near here explained the other girl
i live around the block said the girl in lilac
can i see you home
to the corner if you want to
the other girl took a few steps backward
anthony removed his hat
you're supposed to salute said the girl in lilac with a laugh
all the soldiers salute
i'll learn he responded soberly
the other girl said well hesitated then added call me up tomorrow dot and retreated from the yellow circle of the streetlamp
then in silence anthony and the girl in lilac walked the three blocks to the small rickety house which was her home
outside the wooden gate she hesitated
wellthanks
must you go in so soon
i ought to
can't you stroll around a little longer
she regarded him dispassionately
i don't even know you
anthony laughed
it's not too late
i reckon i better go in
i thought we might walk down and see a movie
i'd like to
then i could bring you home
i'd have just enough time
i've got to be in camp by eleven
it was so dark that he could scarcely see her now
she was a dress swayed infinitesimally by the wind two limpid reckless eyes   why don't you comedot
don't you like movies
better come
she shook her head
i oughtn't to
he liked her realizing that she was temporizing for the effect on him
he came closer and took her hand
if we get back by ten can't you
just to the movies
welli reckon so  hand in hand they walked back toward downtown along a hazy dusky street where a negro newsboy was calling an extra in the cadence of the local venders' tradition a cadence that was as musical as song
dot  anthony's affair with dorothy raycroft was an inevitable result of his increasing carelessness about himself
he did not go to her desiring to possess the desirable nor did he fall before a personality more vital more compelling than his own as he had done with gloria four years before
he merely slid into the matter through his inability to make definite judgments
he could say no
neither to man nor woman borrower and temptress alike found him tenderminded and pliable
indeed he seldom made decisions at all and when he did they were but halfhysterical resolves formed in the panic of some aghast and irreparable awakening
the particular weakness he indulged on this occasion was his need of excitement and stimulus from without
he felt that for the first time in four years he could express and interpret himself anew
the girl promised rest the hours in her company each evening alleviated the morbid and inevitably futile poundings of his imagination
he had become a coward in earnestcompletely the slave of a hundred disordered and prowling thoughts which were released by the collapse of the authentic devotion to gloria that had been the chief jailer of his insufficiency
on that first night as they stood by the gate he kissed dorothy and made an engagement to meet her the following saturday
then he went out to camp and with the light burning lawlessly in his tent he wrote a long letter to gloria a glowing letter full of the sentimental dark full of the remembered breath of flowers full of a true and exceeding tendernessthese things he had learned again for a moment in a kiss given and taken under a rich warm moonlight just an hour before
when saturday night came he found dot waiting at the entrance of the bijou moving picture theatre
she was dressed as on the preceding wednesday in her lilac gown of frailest organdy but it had evidently been washed and starched since then for it was fresh and unrumpled
daylight confirmed the impression he had received that in a sketchy faulty way she was lovely
she was clean her features were small irregular but eloquent and appropriate to each other
she was a dark unenduring little floweryet he thought he detected in her some quality of spiritual reticence of strength drawn from her passive acceptance of all things
in this he was mistaken
dorothy raycroft was nineteen
her father had kept a small unprosperous corner store and she had graduated from high school in the lowest fourth of her class two days before he died
at high school she had enjoyed a rather unsavory reputation
as a matter of fact her behavior at the class picnic where the rumors started had been merely indiscreetshe had retained her technical purity until over a year later
the boy had been a clerk in a store on jackson street and on the day after the incident he departed unexpectedly to new york
he had been intending to leave for some time but had tarried for the consummation of his amorous enterprise
after a while she confided the adventure to a girl friend and later as she watched her friend disappear down the sleepy street of dusty sunshine she knew in a flash of intuition that her story was going out into the world
yet after telling it she felt much better and a little bitter and made as near an approach to character as she was capable of by walking in another direction and meeting another man with the honest intention of gratifying herself again
as a rule things happened to dot
she was not weak because there was nothing in her to tell her she was being weak
she was not strong because she never knew that some of the things she did were brave
she neither defied nor conformed nor compromised
she had no sense of humor but to take its place a happy disposition that made her laugh at the proper times when she was with men
she had no definite intentionssometimes she regretted vaguely that her reputation precluded what chance she had ever had for security
there had been no open discovery her mother was interested only in starting her off on time each morning for the jewelry store where she earned fourteen dollars a week
but some of the boys she had known in high school now looked the other way when they were walking with nice girls and these incidents hurt her feelings
when they occurred she went home and cried
besides the jackson street clerk there had been two other men of whom the first was a naval officer who passed through town during the early days of the war
he had stayed over a night to make a connection and was leaning idly against one of the pillars of the stonewall hotel when she passed by
he remained in town four days
she thought she loved himlavished on him that first hysteria of passion that would have gone to the pusillanimous clerk
the naval officer's uniformthere were few of them in those dayshad made the magic
he left with vague promises on his lips and once on the train rejoiced that he had not told her his real name
her resultant depression had thrown her into the arms of cyrus fielding the son of a local clothier who had hailed her from his roadster one day as she passed along the sidewalk
she had always known him by name
had she been born to a higher stratum he would have known her before
she had descended a little lowerso he met her after all
after a month he had gone away to trainingcamp a little afraid of the intimacy a little relieved in perceiving that she had not cared deeply for him and that she was not the sort who would ever make trouble
dot romanticized this affair and conceded to her vanity that the war had taken these men away from her
she told herself that she could have married the naval officer
nevertheless it worried her that within eight months there had been three men in her life
she thought with more fear than wonder in her heart that she would soon be like those bad girls on jackson street at whom she and her gumchewing giggling friends had stared with fascinated glances three years before
for a while she attempted to be more careful
she let men pick her up she let them kiss her and even allowed certain other liberties to be forced upon her but she did not add to her trio
after several months the strength of her resolutionor rather the poignant expediency of her fearswas worn away
she grew restless drowsing there out of life and time while the summer months faded
the soldiers she met were either obviously below her or less obviously above herin which case they desired only to use her they were yankees harsh and ungracious they swarmed in large crowds and then she met anthony
on that first evening he had been little more than a pleasantly unhappy face a voice the means with which to pass an hour but when she kept her engagement with him on saturday she regarded him with consideration
she liked him
unknowingly she saw her own tragedies mirrored in his face
again they went to the movies again they wandered along the shadowy scented streets hand in hand this time speaking a little in hushed voices
they passed through the gateup toward the little porch  i can stay a while can't i
sh
she whispered we've got to be very quiet
mother sits up reading snappy stories
in confirmation he heard the faint crackling inside as a page was turned
the openshutter slits emitted horizontal rods of light that fell in thin parallels across dorothy's skirt
the street was silent save for a group on the steps of a house across the way who from time to time raised their voices in a soft bantering song  
when you waake you shall haave all the pretty little hawsiz  then as though it had been waiting on a nearby roof for their arrival the moon came slanting suddenly through the vines and turned the girl's face to the color of white roses
anthony had a start of memory so vivid that before his closed eyes there formed a picture distinct as a flashback on a screena spring night of thaw set out of time in a halfforgotten winter five years beforeanother face radiant flowerlike upturned to lights as transforming as the stars  ah la belle dame sans merci who lived in his heart made known to him in transitory fading splendor by dark eyes in the ritzcarlton by a shadowy glance from a passing carriage in the bois de boulogne
but those nights were only part of a song a remembered gloryhere again were the faint winds the illusions the eternal present with its promise of romance
oh she whispered do you love me
do you love me
the spell was brokenthe drifted fragments of the stars became only light the singing down the street diminished to a monotone to the whimper of locusts in the grass
with almost a sigh he kissed her fervent mouth while her arms crept up about his shoulders
the manatarms  as the weeks dried up and blew away the range of anthony's travels extended until he grew to comprehend the camp and its environment
for the first time in his life he was in constant personal contact with the waiters to whom he had given tips the chauffeurs who had touched their hats to him the carpenters plumbers barbers and farmers who had previously been remarkable only in the subservience of their professional genuflections
during his first two months in camp he did not hold ten minutes' consecutive conversation with a single man
on the service record his occupation stood as student on the original questionnaire he had prematurely written author but when men in his company asked his business he commonly gave it as bank clerkhad he told the truth that he did no work they would have been suspicious of him as a member of the leisure class
his platoon sergeant pop donnelly was a scraggly old soldier worn thin with drink
in the past he had spent unnumbered weeks in the guardhouse but recently thanks to the drillmaster famine he had been elevated to his present pinnacle
his complexion was full of shellholesit bore an unmistakable resemblance to those aerial photographs of the battlefield at blank
once a week he got drunk downtown on white liquor returned quietly to camp and collapsed upon his bunk joining the company at reveille looking more than ever like a white mask of death
he nursed the astounding delusion that he was astutely slipping it over on the governmenthe had spent eighteen years in its service at a minute wage and he was soon to retire here he usually winked on the impressive income of fiftyfive dollars a month
he looked upon it as a gorgeous joke that he had played upon the dozens who had bullied and scorned him since he was a georgia country boy of nineteen
at present there were but two lieutenantshopkins and the popular kretching
the latter was considered a good fellow and a fine leader until a year later when he disappeared with a mess fund of eleven hundred dollars and like so many leaders proved exceedingly difficult to follow
eventually there was captain dunning god of this brief but selfsufficing microcosm
he was a reserve officer nervous energetic and enthusiastic
this latter quality indeed often took material form and was visible as fine froth in the corners of his mouth
like most executives he saw his charges strictly from the front and to his hopeful eyes his command seemed just such an excellent unit as such an excellent war deserved
for all his anxiety and absorption he was having the time of his life
baptiste the little sicilian of the train fell foul of him the second week of drill
the captain had several times ordered the men to be cleanshaven when they fell in each morning
one day there was disclosed an alarming breech of this rule surely a case of teutonic connivanceduring the night four men had grown hair upon their faces
the fact that three of the four understood a minimum of english made a practical objectlesson only the more necessary so captain dunning resolutely sent a volunteer barber back to the company street for a razor
whereupon for the safety of democracy a halfounce of hair was scraped dry from the cheeks of three italians and one pole
outside the world of the company there appeared from time to time the colonel a heavy man with snarling teeth who circumnavigated the battalion drillfield upon a handsome black horse
he was a west pointer and mimetically a gentleman
he had a dowdy wife and a dowdy mind and spent much of his time in town taking advantage of the army's lately exalted social position
last of all was the general who traversed the roads of the camp preceded by his flaga figure so austere so removed so magnificent as to be scarcely comprehensible
december
cool winds at night now and damp chilly mornings on the drillgrounds
as the heat faded anthony found himself increasingly glad to be alive
renewed strangely through his body he worried little and existed in the present with a sort of animal content
it was not that gloria or the life that gloria represented was less often in his thoughtsit was simply that she became day by day less real less vivid
for a week they had corresponded passionately almost hystericallythen by an unwritten agreement they had ceased to write more than twice and then once a week
she was bored she said if his brigade was to be there a long time she was coming down to join him
mr haight was going to be able to submit a stronger brief than he had expected but doubted that the appealed case would come up until late spring
muriel was in the city doing red cross work and they went out together rather often
what would anthony think if she went into the red cross
trouble was she had heard that she might have to bathe negroes in alcohol and after that she hadn't felt so patriotic
the city was full of soldiers and she'd seen a lot of boys she hadn't laid eyes on for years  anthony did not want her to come south
he told himself that this was for many reasonshe needed a rest from her and she from him
she would be bored beyond measure in town and she would be able to see anthony for only a few hours each day
but in his heart he feared that it was because he was attracted to dorothy
as a matter of fact he lived in terror that gloria should learn by some chance or intention of the relation he had formed
by the end of a fortnight the entanglement began to give him moments of misery at his own faithlessness
nevertheless as each day ended he was unable to withstand the lure that would draw him irresistibly out of his tent and over to the telephone at the ymca
dot
yes
i may be able to get in tonight
i'm so glad
do you want to listen to my splendid eloquence for a few starry hours
oh you funny for an instant he had a memory of five years beforeof geraldine
then  i'll arrive about eight
at seven he would be in a jitney bound for the city where hundreds of little southern girls were waiting on moonlit porches for their lovers
he would be excited already for her warm retarded kisses for the amazed quietude of the glances she gave himglances nearer to worship than any he had ever inspired
gloria and he had been equals giving without thought of thanks or obligation
to this girl his very caresses were an inestimable boon
crying quietly she had confessed to him that he was not the first man in her life there had been one otherhe gathered that the affair had no sooner commenced than it had been over
indeed so far as she was concerned she spoke the truth
she had forgotten the clerk the naval officer the clothier's son forgotten her vividness of emotion which is true forgetting
she knew that in some opaque and shadowy existence some one had taken herit was as though it had occurred in sleep
almost every night anthony came to town
it was too cool now for the porch so her mother surrendered to them the tiny sitting room with its dozens of cheaply framed chromos its yard upon yard of decorative fringe and its thick atmosphere of several decades in the proximity of the kitchen
they would build a firethen happily inexhaustibly she would go about the business of love
each evening at ten she would walk with him to the door her black hair in disarray her face pale without cosmetics paler still under the whiteness of the moon
as a rule it would be bright and silver outside now and then there was a slow warm rain too indolent almost to reach the ground
say you love me she would whisper
why of course you sweet baby
am i a baby
this almost wistfully
just a little baby
she knew vaguely of gloria
it gave her pain to think of it so she imagined her to be haughty and proud and cold
she had decided that gloria must be older than anthony and that there was no love between husband and wife
sometimes she let herself dream that after the war anthony would get a divorce and they would be marriedbut she never mentioned this to anthony she scarcely knew why
she shared his company's idea that he was a sort of bank clerkshe thought that he was respectable and poor
she would say  if i had some money darlin' i'd give ev'y bit of it to you
i'd like to have about fifty thousand dollars
i suppose that'd be plenty agreed anthony
in her letter that day gloria had written i suppose if we could settle for a million it would be better to tell mr haight to go ahead and settle
but it'd seem a pity   we could have an automobile exclaimed dot in a final burst of triumph
an impressive occasion  captain dunning prided himself on being a great reader of character
half an hour after meeting a man he was accustomed to place him in one of a number of astonishing categoriesfine man good man smart fellow theorizer poet and worthless
one day early in february he caused anthony to be summoned to his presence in the orderly tent
patch he said sententiously i've had my eye on you for several weeks
anthony stood erect and motionless
and i think you've got the makings of a good soldier
he waited for the warm glow which this would naturally arouse to cooland then continued  this is no child's play he said narrowing his brows
anthony agreed with a melancholy no sir
it's a man's gameand we need leaders
then the climax swift sure and electric patch i'm going to make you a corporal
at this point anthony should have staggered slightly backward overwhelmed
he was to be one of the quarter million selected for that consummate trust
he was going to be able to shout the technical phrase follow me
to seven other frightened men
you seem to be a man of some education said captain dunning
yes sir
that's good that's good
education's a great thing but don't let it go to your head
keep on the way you're doing and you'll be a good soldier
with these parting words lingering in his ears corporal patch saluted executed a right about face and left the tent
though the conversation amused anthony it did generate the idea that life would be more amusing as a sergeant or should he find a less exacting medical examiner as an officer
he was little interested in the work which seemed to belie the army's boasted gallantry
at the inspections one did not dress up to look well one dressed up to keep from looking badly
but as winter wore awaythe short snowless winter marked by damp nights and cool rainy dayshe marvelled at how quickly the system had grasped him
he was a soldierall who were not soldiers were civilians
the world was divided primarily into those two classifications
it occurred to him that all strongly accentuated classes such as the military divided men into two kinds their own kindand those without
to the clergyman there were clergy and laity to the catholic there were catholics and noncatholics to the negro there were blacks and whites to the prisoner there were the imprisoned and the free and to the sick man there were the sick and the well
so without thinking of it once in his lifetime he had been a civilian a layman a noncatholic a gentile white free and well  as the american troops were poured into the french and british trenches he began to find the names of many harvard men among the casualties recorded in the army and navy journal
but for all the sweat and blood the situation appeared unchanged and he saw no prospect of the war's ending in the perceptible future
in the old chronicles the right wing of one army always defeated the left wing of the other the left wing being meanwhile vanquished by the enemy's right
after that the mercenaries fled
it had been so simple in those days almost as if prearranged  gloria wrote that she was reading a great deal
what a mess they had made of their affairs she said
she had so little to do now that she spent her time imagining how differently things might have turned out
her whole environment appeared insecureand a few years back she had seemed to hold all the strings in her own little hand
in june her letters grew hurried and less frequent
she suddenly ceased to write about coming south
defeat  march in the country around was rare with jasmine and jonquils and patches of violets in the warming grass
afterward he remembered especially one afternoon of such a fresh and magic glamour that as he stood in the riflepit marking targets he recited atalanta in calydon to an uncomprehending pole his voice mingling with the rip sing and splatter of the bullets overhead
when the hounds of spring   spang  are on winter's traces   whirrrrr   the mother of months   hey come to
mark threeee
  in town the streets were in a sleepy dream again and together anthony and dot idled in their own tracks of the previous autumn until he began to feel a drowsy attachment for this southa south it seemed more of algiers than of italy with faded aspirations pointing back over innumerable generations to some warm primitive nirvana without hope or care
here there was an inflection of cordiality of comprehension in every voice
life plays the same lovely and agonizing joke on all of us they seemed to say in their plaintive pleasant cadence in the rising inflection terminating on an unresolved minor
he liked his barber shop where he was hi corporal
to a pale emaciated young man who shaved him and pushed a cool vibrating machine endlessly over his insatiable head
he liked johnston's gardens where they danced where a tragic negro made yearning aching music on a saxophone until the garish hall became an enchanted jungle of barbaric rhythms and smoky laughter where to forget the uneventful passage of time upon dorothy's soft sighs and tender whisperings was the consummation of all aspiration of all content
there was an undertone of sadness in her character a conscious evasion of all except the pleasurable minutiae of life
her violet eyes would remain for hours apparently insensate as thoughtless and reckless she basked like a cat in the sun
he wondered what the tired spiritless mother thought of them and whether in her moments of uttermost cynicism she ever guessed at their relationship
on sunday afternoons they walked along the countryside resting at intervals on the dry moss in the outskirts of a wood
here the birds had gathered and the clusters of violets and white dogwood here the hoar trees shone crystalline and cool oblivious to the intoxicating heat that waited outside here he would talk intermittently in a sleepy monologue in a conversation of no significance of no replies
july came scorching down
captain dunning was ordered to detail one of his men to learn blacksmithing
the regiment was filling up to war strength and he needed most of his veterans for drillmasters so he selected the little italian baptiste whom he could most easily spare
little baptiste had never had anything to do with horses
his fear made matters worse
he reappeared in the orderly room one day and told captain dunning that he wanted to die if he couldn't be relieved
the horses kicked at him he said he was no good at the work
finally he fell on his knees and besought captain dunning in a mixture of broken english and scriptural italian to get him out of it
he had not slept for three days monstrous stallions reared and cavorted through his dreams
captain dunning reproved the company clerk who had burst out laughing and told baptiste he would do what he could
but when he thought it over he decided that he couldn't spare a better man
little baptiste went from bad to worse
the horses seemed to divine his fear and take every advantage of it
two weeks later a great black mare crushed his skull in with her hoofs while he was trying to lead her from her stall
in midjuly came rumors and then orders that concerned a change of camp
the brigade was to move to an empty cantonment a hundred miles farther south there to be expanded into a division
at first the men thought they were departing for the trenches and all evening little groups jabbered in the company street shouting to each other in swaggering exclamations suuure we are
when the truth leaked out it was rejected indignantly as a blind to conceal their real destination
they revelled in their own importance
that night they told their girls in town that they were going to get the germans
anthony circulated for a while among the groupsthen stopping a jitney rode down to tell dot that he was going away
she was waiting on the dark veranda in a cheap white dress that accentuated the youth and softness of her face
oh she whispered i've wanted you so honey
all this day
i have something to tell you
she drew him down beside her on the swinging seat not noticing his ominous tone
tell me
we're leaving next week
her arms seeking his shoulders remained poised upon the dark air her chin tipped up
when she spoke the softness was gone from her voice
leaving for france
no
less luck than that
leaving for some darn camp in mississippi
she shut her eyes and he could see that the lids were trembling
dear little dot life is so damned hard
she was crying upon his shoulder
so damned hard so damned hard he repeated aimlessly it just hurts people and hurts people until finally it hurts them so that they can't be hurt ever any more
that's the last and worst thing it does
frantic wild with anguish she strained him to her breast
oh god
she whispered brokenly you can't go way from me
i'd die
he was finding it impossible to pass off his departure as a common impersonal blow
he was too near to her to do more than repeat poor little dot
poor little dot
and then what
she demanded wearily
what do you mean
you're my whole life that's all
i'd die for you right now if you said so
i'd get a knife and kill myself
you can't leave me here
her tone frightened him
these things happen he said evenly
then i'm going with you
tears were streaming down her checks
her mouth was trembling in an ecstasy of grief and fear
sweet he muttered sentimentally sweet little girl
don't you see we'd just be putting off what's bound to happen
i'll be going to france in a few months  she leaned away from him and clinching her fists lifted her face toward the sky
i want to die she said as if moulding each word carefully in her heart
dot he whispered uncomfortably you'll forget
things are sweeter when they're lost
i knowbecause once i wanted something and got it
it was the only thing i ever wanted badly dot
and when i got it it turned to dust in my hands
all right
absorbed in himself he continued  i've often thought that if i hadn't got what i wanted things might have been different with me
i might have found something in my mind and enjoyed putting it in circulation
i might have been content with the work of it and had some sweet vanity out of the success
i suppose that at one time i could have had anything i wanted within reason but that was the only thing i ever wanted with any fervor
god
and that taught me you can't have anything you can't have anything at all
because desire just cheats you
it's like a sunbeam skipping here and there about a room
it stops and gilds some inconsequential object and we poor fools try to grasp itbut when we do the sunbeam moves on to something else and you've got the inconsequential part but the glitter that made you want it is gone he broke off uneasily
she had risen and was standing dryeyed picking little leaves from a dark vine
dot  go way she said coldly
what
why
i don't want just words
if that's all you have for me you'd better go
why dot  what's death to me is just a lot of words to you
you put 'em together so pretty
i'm sorry
i was talking about you dot
go way from here
he approached her with arms outstretched but she held him away
you don't want me to go with you she said evenly maybe you're going to meet thatthat girl she could not bring herself to say wife
how do i know
well then i reckon you're not my fellow any more
so go way
for a moment while conflicting warnings and desires prompted anthony it seemed one of those rare times when he would take a step prompted from within
he hesitated
then a wave of weariness broke against him
it was too lateeverything was too late
for years now he had dreamed the world away basing his decisions upon emotions unstable as water
the little girl in the white dress dominated him as she approached beauty in the hard symmetry of her desire
the fire blazing in her dark and injured heart seemed to glow around her like a flame
with some profound and uncharted pride she had made herself remote and so achieved her purpose
i didn'tmean to seem so callous dot
it don't matter
the fire rolled over anthony
something wrenched at his bowels and he stood there helpless and beaten
come with me dotlittle loving dot
oh come with me
i couldn't leave you now  with a sob she wound her arms around him and let him support her weight while the moon at its perennial labor of covering the bad complexion of the world showered its illicit honey over the drowsy street
the catastrophe  early september in camp boone mississippi
the darkness alive with insects beat in upon the mosquitonetting beneath the shelter of which anthony was trying to write a letter
an intermittent chatter over a poker game was going on in the next tent and outside a man was strolling up the company street singing a current bit of doggerel about kkkkaty
with an effort anthony hoisted himself to his elbow and pencil in hand looked down at his blank sheet of paper
then omitting any heading he began  i can't imagine what the matter is gloria
i haven't had a line from you for two weeks and it's only natural to be worried  he threw this away with a disturbed grunt and began again  i don't know what to think gloria
your last letter short cold without a word of affection or even a decent account of what you've been doing came two weeks ago
it's only natural that i should wonder
if your love for me isn't absolutely dead it seems that you'd at least keep me from worry  again he crumpled the page and tossed it angrily through a tear in the tent wall realizing simultaneously that he would have to pick it up in the morning
he felt disinclined to try again
he could get no warmth into the linesonly a persistent jealousy and suspicion
since midsummer these discrepancies in gloria's correspondence had grown more and more noticeable
at first he had scarcely perceived them
he was so inured to the perfunctory dearest and darlings scattered through her letters that he was oblivious to their presence or absence
but in this last fortnight he had become increasingly aware that there was something amiss
he had sent her a nightletter saying that he had passed his examinations for an officers' trainingcamp and expected to leave for georgia shortly
she had not answered
he had wired againwhen he received no word he imagined that she might be out of town
but it occurred and recurred to him that she was not out of town and a series of distraught imaginings began to plague him
supposing gloria bored and restless had found some one even as he had
the thought terrified him with its possibilityit was chiefly because he had been so sure of her personal integrity that he had considered her so sparingly during the year
and now as a doubt was born the old angers the rages of possession swarmed back a thousandfold
what more natural than that she should be in love again
he remembered the gloria who promised that should she ever want anything she would take it insisting that since she would act entirely for her own satisfaction she could go through such an affair unsmirchedit was only the effect on a person's mind that counted anyhow she said and her reaction would be the masculine one of satiation and faint dislike
but that had been when they were first married
later with the discovery that she could be jealous of anthony she had outwardly at least changed her mind
there were no other men in the world for her
this he had known only too surely
perceiving that a certain fastidiousness would restrain her he had grown lax in preserving the completeness of her lovewhich after all was the keystone of the entire structure
meanwhile all through the summer he had been maintaining dot in a boardinghouse downtown
to do this it had been necessary to write to his broker for money
dot had covered her journey south by leaving her house a day before the brigade broke camp informing her mother in a note that she had gone to new york
on the evening following anthony had called as though to see her
mrs raycroft was in a state of collapse and there was a policeman in the parlor
a questionnaire had ensued from which anthony had extricated himself with some difficulty
in september with his suspicions of gloria the company of dot had become tedious then almost intolerable
he was nervous and irritable from lack of sleep his heart was sick and afraid
three days ago he had gone to captain dunning and asked for a furlough only to be met with benignant procrastination
the division was starting overseas while anthony was going to an officers' trainingcamp what furloughs could be given must go to the men who were leaving the country
upon this refusal anthony had started to the telegraph office intending to wire gloria to come southhe reached the door and receded despairingly seeing the utter impracticability of such a move
then he had spent the evening quarrelling irritably with dot and returned to camp morose and angry with the world
there had been a disagreeable scene in the midst of which he had precipitately departed
what was to be done with her did not seem to concern him vitally at presenthe was completely absorbed in the disheartening silence of his wife
the flap of the tent made a sudden triangle back upon itself and a dark head appeared against the night
sergeant patch
the accent was italian and anthony saw by the belt that the man was a headquarters orderly
want me
lady call up headquarters ten minutes ago
say she have speak with you
ver' important
anthony swept aside the mosquitonetting and stood up
it might be a wire from gloria telephoned over
she say to get you
she call again ten o'clock
all right thanks
he picked up his hat and in a moment was striding beside the orderly through the hot almost suffocating darkness
over in the headquarters shack he saluted a dozing nightservice officer
sit down and wait suggested the lieutenant nonchalantly
girl seemed awful anxious to speak to you
anthony's hopes fell away
thank you very much sir
and as the phone squeaked on the sidewall he knew who was calling
this is dot came an unsteady voice i've got to see you
dot i told you i couldn't get down for several days
i've got to see you tonight
it's important
it's too late he said coldly it's ten o'clock and i have to be in camp at eleven
all right
there was so much wretchedness compressed into the two words that anthony felt a measure of compunction
what's the matter
i want to tell you goodby
oh don't be a little idiot
he exclaimed
but his spirits rose
what luck if she should leave town this very night
what a burden from his soul
but he said you can't possibly leave before tomorrow
out of the corner of his eye he saw the nightservice officer regarding him quizzically
then startlingly came dot's next words  i don't mean 'leave' that way
anthony's hand clutched the receiver fiercely
he felt his nerves turning cold as if the heat was leaving his body
what
then quickly in a wild broken voice he heard  goodbyoh goodby
cullup she had hung up the receiver
with a sound that was half a gasp half a cry anthony hurried from the headquarters building
outside under the stars that dripped like silver tassels through the trees of the little grove he stood motionless hesitating
had she meant to kill herselfoh the little fool
he was filled with bitter hate toward her
in this dnouement he found it impossible to realize that he had ever begun such an entanglement such a mess a sordid mlange of worry and pain
he found himself walking slowly away repeating over and over that it was futile to worry
he had best go back to his tent and sleep
he needed sleep
god
would he ever sleep again
his mind was in a vast clamor and confusion as he reached the road he turned around in a panic and began running not toward his company but away from it
men were returning nowhe could find a taxicab
after a minute two yellow eyes appeared around a bend
desperately he ran toward them
jitney
jitney

it was an empty ford i want to go to town
cost you a dollar
all right
if you'll just hurry  after an interminable time he ran up the steps of a dark ramshackle little house and through the door almost knocking over an immense negress who was walking candle in hand along the hall
where's my wife
he cried wildly
she gone to bed
up the stairs three at a time down the creaking passage
the room was dark and silent and with trembling fingers he struck a match
two wide eyes looked up at him from a wretched ball of clothes on the bed
ah i knew you'd come she murmured brokenly
anthony grew cold with anger
so it was just a plan to get me down here get me in trouble
he said
god damn it you've shouted 'wolf' once too often
she regarded him pitifully
i had to see you
i couldn't have lived
oh i had to see you  he sat down on the side of the bed and slowly shook his head
you're no good he said decisively talking unconsciously as gloria might have talked to him
this sort of thing isn't fair to me you know
come closer
whatever he might say dot was happy now
he cared for her
she had brought him to her side
oh god said anthony hopelessly
as weariness rolled along its inevitable wave his anger subsided receded vanished
he collapsed suddenly fell sobbing beside her on the bed
oh my darling she begged him don't cry
oh don't cry
she took his head upon her breast and soothed him mingled her happy tears with the bitterness of his
her hand played gently with his dark hair
i'm such a little fool she murmured brokenly but i love you and when you're cold to me it seems as if it isn't worth while to go on livin'
after all this was peacethe quiet room with the mingled scent of women's powder and perfume dot's hand soft as a warm wind upon his hair the rise and fall of her bosom as she took breathfor a moment it was as though it were gloria there as though he were at rest in some sweeter and safer home than he had ever known
an hour passed
a clock began to chime in the hall
he jumped to his feet and looked at the phosphorescent hands of his wrist watch
it was twelve o'clock
he had trouble in finding a taxi that would take him out at that hour
as he urged the driver faster along the road he speculated on the best method of entering camp
he had been late several times recently and he knew that were he caught again his name would probably be stricken from the list of officer candidates
he wondered if he had not better dismiss the taxi and take a chance on passing the sentry in the dark
still officers often rode past the sentries after midnight
halt
the monosyllable came from the yellow glare that the headlights dropped upon the changing road
the taxidriver threw out his clutch and a sentry walked up carrying his rifle at the port
with him by an ill chance was the officer of the guard
out late sergeant
yes sir
got delayed
too bad
have to take your name
as the officer waited notebook and pencil in hand something not fully intended crowded to anthony's lips something born of panic of muddle of despair
sergeant ra foley he answered breathlessly
and the outfit
company q eightythird infantry
all right
you'll have to walk from here sergeant
anthony saluted quickly paid his taxidriver and set off for a run toward the regiment he had named
when he was out of sight he changed his course and with his heart beating wildly hurried to his company feeling that he had made a fatal error of judgment
two days later the officer who had been in command of the guard recognized him in a barber shop downtown
in charge of a military policeman he was taken back to the camp where he was reduced to the ranks without trial and confined for a month to the limits of his company street
with this blow a spell of utter depression overtook him and within a week he was again caught downtown wandering around in a drunken daze with a pint of bootleg whiskey in his hip pocket
it was because of a sort of craziness in his behavior at the trial that his sentence to the guardhouse was for only three weeks
nightmare  early in his confinement the conviction took root in him that he was going mad
it was as though there were a quantity of dark yet vivid personalities in his mind some of them familiar some of them strange and terrible held in check by a little monitor who sat aloft somewhere and looked on
the thing that worried him was that the monitor was sick and holding out with difficulty
should he give up should he falter for a moment out would rush these intolerable thingsonly anthony could know what a state of blackness there would be if the worst of him could roam his consciousness unchecked
the heat of the day had changed somehow until it was a burnished darkness crushing down upon a devastated land
over his head the blue circles of ominous uncharted suns of unnumbered centres of fire revolved interminably before his eyes as though he were lying constantly exposed to the hot light and in a state of feverish coma
at seven in the morning something phantasmal something almost absurdly unreal that he knew was his mortal body went out with seven other prisoners and two guards to work on the camp roads
one day they loaded and unloaded quantities of gravel spread it raked itthe next day they worked with huge barrels of redhot tar flooding the gravel with black shining pools of molten heat
at night locked up in the guardhouse he would lie without thought without courage to compass thought staring at the irregular beams of the ceiling overhead until about three o'clock when he would slip into a broken troubled sleep
during the work hours he labored with uneasy haste attempting as the day bore toward the sultry mississippi sunset to tire himself physically so that in the evening he might sleep deeply from utter exhaustion then one afternoon in the second week he had a feeling that two eyes were watching him from a place a few feet beyond one of the guards
this aroused him to a sort of terror
he turned his back on the eyes and shovelled feverishly until it became necessary for him to face about and go for more gravel
then they entered his vision again and his already taut nerves tightened up to the breakingpoint
the eyes were leering at him
out of a hot silence he heard his name called in a tragic voice and the earth tipped absurdly back and forth to a babel of shouting and confusion
when next he became conscious he was back in the guardhouse and the other prisoners were throwing him curious glances
the eyes returned no more
it was many days before he realized that the voice must have been dot's that she had called out to him and made some sort of disturbance
he decided this just previous to the expiration of his sentence when the cloud that oppressed him had lifted leaving him in a deep dispirited lethargy
as the conscious mediator the monitor who kept that fearsome mnage of horror grew stronger anthony became physically weaker
he was scarcely able to get through the two days of toil and when he was released one rainy afternoon and returned to his company he reached his tent only to fall into a heavy doze from which he awoke before dawn aching and unrefreshed
beside his cot were two letters that had been awaiting him in the orderly tent for some time
the first was from gloria it was short and cool                                       the case is coming to trial late in november
can you possibly get leave  i've tried to write you again and again but it just seems to make things worse
i want to see you about several matters but you know that you have once prevented me from coming and i am disinclined to try again
in view of a number of things it seems necessary that we have a conference
i'm very glad about your appointment  gloria
                              he was too tired to try to understandor to care
her phrases her intentions were all very far away in an incomprehensible past
at the second letter he scarcely glanced it was from dotan incoherent tearswollen scrawl a flood of protest endearment and grief
after a page he let it slip from his inert hand and drowsed back into a nebulous hinterland of his own
at drillcall he awoke with a high fever and fainted when he tried to leave his tentat noon he was sent to the base hospital with influenza
he was aware that this sickness was providential
it saved him from a hysterical relapseand he recovered in time to entrain on a damp november day for new york and for the interminable massacre beyond
when the regiment reached camp mills long island anthony's single idea was to get into the city and see gloria as soon as possible
it was now evident that an armistice would be signed within the week but rumor had it that in any case troops would continue to be shipped to france until the last moment
anthony was appalled at the notion of the long voyage of a tedious debarkation at a french port and of being kept abroad for a year possibly to replace the troops who had seen actual fighting
his intention had been to obtain a twoday furlough but camp mills proved to be under a strict influenza quarantineit was impossible for even an officer to leave except on official business
for a private it was out of the question
the camp itself was a dreary muddle cold windswept and filthy with the accumulated dirt incident to the passage through of many divisions
their train came in at seven one night and they waited in line until one while a military tangle was straightened out somewhere ahead
officers ran up and down ceaselessly calling orders and making a great uproar
it turned out that the trouble was due to the colonel who was in a righteous temper because he was a west pointer and the war was going to stop before he could get overseas
had the militant governments realized the number of broken hearts among the older west pointers during that week they would indubitably have prolonged the slaughter another month
the thing was pitiable
gazing out at the bleak expanse of tents extending for miles over a trodden welter of slush and snow anthony saw the impracticability of trudging to a telephone that night
he would call her at the first opportunity in the morning
aroused in the chill and bitter dawn he stood at reveille and listened to a passionate harangue from captain dunning  you men may think the war is over
well let me tell you it isn't
those fellows aren't going to sign the armistice
it's another trick and we'd be crazy to let anything slacken up here in the company because let me tell you we're going to sail from here within a week and when we do we're going to see some real fighting
he paused that they might get the full effect of his pronouncement
and then if you think the war's over just talk to any one who's been in it and see if they think the germans are all in
they don't
nobody does
i've talked to the people that know and they say there'll be anyways a year longer of war
they don't think it's over
so you men better not get any foolish ideas that it is
doubly stressing this final admonition he ordered the company dismissed
at noon anthony set off at a run for the nearest canteen telephone
as he approached what corresponded to the downtown of the camp he noticed that many other soldiers were running also that a man near him had suddenly leaped into the air and clicked his heels together
the tendency to run became general and from little excited groups here and there came the sounds of cheering
he stopped and listenedover the cold country whistles were blowing and the chimes of the garden city churches broke suddenly into reverberatory sound
anthony began to run again
the cries were clear and distinct now as they rose with clouds of frosted breath into the chilly air  germany's surrendered
germany's surrendered
   the false armistice  that evening in the opaque gloom of six o'clock anthony slipped between two freightcars and once over the railroad followed the track along to garden city where he caught an electric train for new york
he stood some chance of apprehensionhe knew that the military police were often sent through the cars to ask for passes but he imagined that tonight the vigilance would be relaxed
but in any event he would have tried to slip through for he had been unable to locate gloria by telephone and another day of suspense would have been intolerable
after inexplicable stops and waits that reminded him of the night he had left new york over a year before they drew into the pennsylvania station and he followed the familiar way to the taxistand finding it grotesque and oddly stimulating to give his own address
broadway was a riot of light thronged as he had never seen it with a carnival crowd which swept its glittering way through scraps of paper piled ankledeep on the sidewalks
here and there elevated upon benches and boxes soldiers addressed the heedless mass each face in which was clear cut and distinct under the white glare overhead
anthony picked out half a dozen figuresa drunken sailor tipped backward and supported by two other gobs was waving his hat and emitting a wild series of roars a wounded soldier crutch in hand was borne along in an eddy on the shoulders of some shrieking civilians a darkhaired girl sat crosslegged and meditative on top of a parked taxicab
here surely the victory had come in time the climax had been scheduled with the uttermost celestial foresight
the great rich nation had made triumphant war suffered enough for poignancy but not enough for bitternesshence the carnival the feasting the triumph
under these bright lights glittered the faces of peoples whose glory had long since passed away whose very civilizations were deadmen whose ancestors had heard the news of victory in babylon in nineveh in bagdad in tyre a hundred generations before men whose ancestors had seen a flowerdecked slaveadorned cortege drift with its wake of captives down the avenues of imperial rome  past the rialto the glittering front of the astor the jewelled magnificence of times square  a gorgeous alley of incandescence ahead thenwas it years laterhe was paying the taxidriver in front of a white building on fiftyseventh street
he was in the hallah there was the negro boy from martinique lazy indolent unchanged
is mrs patch in
i have just came on sah the man announced with his incongruous british accent
take me up  then the slow drone of the elevator the three steps to the door which swung open at the impetus of his knock
gloria
his voice was trembling
no answer
a faint string of smoke was rising from a cigarettetraya number of vanity fair sat astraddle on the table
gloria
he ran into the bedroom the bath
she was not there
a neglige of robin'segg blue laid out upon the bed diffused a faint perfume illusive and familiar
on a chair were a pair of stockings and a street dress an open powder box yawned upon the bureau
she must just have gone out
the telephone rang abruptly and he startedanswered it with all the sensations of an impostor
hello
is mrs patch there
no i'm looking for her myself
who is this
this is mr
crawford
this is mr patch speaking
i've just arrived unexpectedly and i don't know where to find her
oh
mr crawford sounded a bit taken aback
why i imagine she's at the armistice ball
i know she intended going but i didn't think she'd leave so early
where's the armistice ball
at the astor
thanks
anthony hung up sharply and rose
who was mr crawford
and who was it that was taking her to the ball
how long had this been going on
all these questions asked and answered themselves a dozen times a dozen ways
his very proximity to her drove him half frantic
in a frenzy of suspicion he rushed here and there about the apartment hunting for some sign of masculine occupation opening the bathroom cupboard searching feverishly through the bureau drawers
then he found something that made him stop suddenly and sit down on one of the twin beds the corners of his mouth drooping as though he were about to weep
there in a corner of her drawer tied with a frail blue ribbon were all the letters and telegrams he had written her during the year past
he was suffused with happy and sentimental shame
i'm not fit to touch her he cried aloud to the four walls
i'm not fit to touch her little hand
nevertheless he went out to look for her
in the astor lobby he was engulfed immediately in a crowd so thick as to make progress almost impossible
he asked the direction of the ballroom from half a dozen people before he could get a sober and intelligible answer
eventually after a last long wait he checked his military overcoat in the hall
it was only nine but the dance was in full blast
the panorama was incredible
women women everywheregirls gay with wine singing shrilly above the clamor of the dazzling confetticovered throng girls set off by the uniforms of a dozen nations fat females collapsing without dignity upon the floor and retaining selfrespect by shouting hurraw for the allies
 three women with white hair dancing hand in hand around a sailor who revolved in a dizzying spin upon the floor clasping to his heart an empty bottle of champagne
breathlessly anthony scanned the dancers scanned the muddled lines trailing in single file in and out among the tables scanned the hornblowing kissing coughing laughing drinking parties under the great fullbosomed flags which leaned in glowing color over the pageantry and the sound
then he saw gloria
she was sitting at a table for two directly across the room
her dress was black and above it her animated face tinted with the most glamourous rose made he thought a spot of poignant beauty on the room
his heart leaped as though to a new music
he jostled his way toward her and called her name just as the gray eyes looked up and found him
for that instant as their bodies met and melted the world the revel the tumbling whimper of the music faded to an ecstatic monotone hushed as a song of bees
oh my gloria
he cried
her kiss was a cool rill flowing from her heart
chapter ii   a matter of aesthetics  on the night when anthony had left for camp hooker one year before all that was left of the beautiful gloria gilberther shell her young and lovely bodymoved up the broad marble steps of the grand central station with the rhythm of the engine beating in her ears like a dream and out onto vanderbilt avenue where the huge bulk of the biltmore overhung the street and down at its low gleaming entrance sucked in the manycolored operacloaks of gorgeously dressed girls
for a moment she paused by the taxistand and watched themwondering that but a few years before she had been of their number ever setting out for a radiant somewhere always just about to have that ultimate passionate adventure for which the girls' cloaks were delicate and beautifully furred for which their cheeks were painted and their hearts higher than the transitory dome of pleasure that would engulf them coiffure cloak and all
it was growing colder and the men passing had flipped up the collars of their overcoats
this change was kind to her
it would have been kinder still had everything changed weather streets and people and had she been whisked away to wake in some high freshscented room alone and statuesque within and without as in her virginal and colorful past
inside the taxicab she wept impotent tears
that she had not been happy with anthony for over a year mattered little
recently his presence had been no more than what it would awake in her of that memorable june
the anthony of late irritable weak and poor could do no less than make her irritable in turnand bored with everything except the fact that in a highly imaginative and eloquent youth they had come together in an ecstatic revel of emotion
because of this mutually vivid memory she would have done more for anthony than for any other humanso when she got into the taxicab she wept passionately and wanted to call his name aloud
miserable lonesome as a forgotten child she sat in the quiet apartment and wrote him a letter full of confused sentiment                                        i can almost look down the tracks and see you going but without you dearest dearest i can't see or hear or feel or think
being apartwhatever has happened or will happen to usis like begging for mercy from a storm anthony it's like growing old
i want to kiss you soin the back of your neck where your old black hair starts
because i love you and whatever we do or say to each other or have done or have said you've got to feel how much i do how inanimate i am when you're gone
i can't even hate the damnable presence of people those people in the station who haven't any right to livei can't resent them even though they're dirtying up our world because i'm engrossed in wanting you so  if you hated me if you were covered with sores like a leper if you ran away with another woman or starved me or beat mehow absurd this soundsi'd still want you i'd still love you
i know my darling  it's latei have all the windows open and the air outside is just as soft as spring yet somehow much more young and frail than spring
why do they make spring a young girl why does that illusion dance and yodel its way for three months through the world's preposterous barrenness
spring is a lean old plough horse with its ribs showingit's a pile of refuse in a field parched by the sun and the rain to an ominous cleanliness  in a few hours you'll wake up my darlingand you'll be miserable and disgusted with life
you'll be in delaware or carolina or somewhere and so unimportant
i don't believe there's any one alive who can contemplate themselves as an impermanent institution as a luxury or an unnecessary evil
very few of the people who accentuate the futility of life remark the futility of themselves
perhaps they think that in proclaiming the evil of living they somehow salvage their own worth from the ruinbut they don't even you and i   
still i can see you
there's blue haze about the trees where you'll be passing too beautiful to be predominant
no the fallow squares of earth will be most frequentthey'll be along beside the track like dirty coarse brown sheets drying in the sun alive mechanical abominable
nature slovenly old hag has been sleeping in them with every old farmer or negro or immigrant who happened to covet her  so you see that now you're gone i've written a letter all full of contempt and despair
and that just means that i love you anthony with all there is to love with in your  gloria
                              when she had addressed the letter she went to her twin bed and lay down upon it clasping anthony's pillow in her arms as though by sheer force of emotion she could metamorphize it into his warm and living body
two o'clock saw her dryeyed staring with steady persistent grief into the darkness remembering remembering unmercifully blaming herself for a hundred fancied unkindnesses making a likeness of anthony akin to some martyred and transfigured christ
for a time she thought of him as he in his more sentimental moments probably thought of himself
at five she was still awake
a mysterious grinding noise that went on every morning across the areaway told her the hour
she heard an alarm clock ring and saw a light make a yellow square on an illusory blank wall opposite
with the halfformed resolution of following him south immediately her sorrow grew remote and unreal and moved off from her as the dark moved westward
she fell asleep
when she awoke the sight of the empty bed beside her brought a renewal of misery dispelled shortly however by the inevitable callousness of the bright morning
though she was not conscious of it there was relief in eating breakfast without anthony's tired and worried face opposite her
now that she was alone she lost all desire to complain about the food
she would change her breakfasts she thoughthave a lemonade and a tomato sandwich instead of the sempiternal bacon and eggs and toast
nevertheless at noon when she had called up several of her acquaintances including the martial muriel and found each one engaged for lunch she gave way to a quiet pity for herself and her loneliness
curled on the bed with pencil and paper she wrote anthony another letter
late in the afternoon arrived a special delivery mailed from some small new jersey town and the familiarity of the phrasing the almost audible undertone of worry and discontent were so familiar that they comforted her
who knew
perhaps army discipline would harden anthony and accustom him to the idea of work
she had immutable faith that the war would be over before he was called upon to fight and meanwhile the suit would be won and they could begin again this time on a different basis
the first thing different would be that she would have a child
it was unbearable that she should be so utterly alone
it was a week before she could stay in the apartment with the probability of remaining dryeyed
there seemed little in the city that was amusing
muriel had been shifted to a hospital in new jersey from which she took a metropolitan holiday only every other week and with this defection gloria grew to realize how few were the friends she had made in all these years of new york
the men she knew were in the army
men she knewshe had conceded vaguely to herself that all the men who had ever been in love with her were her friends
each one of them had at a certain considerable time professed to value her favor above anything in life
but nowwhere were they
at least two were dead half a dozen or more were married the rest scattered from france to the philippines
she wondered whether any of them thought of her and how often and in what respect
most of them must still picture the little girl of seventeen or so the adolescent siren of nine years before
the girls too were gone far afield
she had never been popular in school
she had been too beautiful too lazy not sufficiently conscious of being a farmover girl and a future wife and mother in perpetual capital letters
and girls who had never been kissed hinted with shocked expressions on their plain but not particularly wholesome faces that gloria had
then these girls had gone east or west or south married and become people prophesying if they prophesied about gloria that she would come to a bad endnot knowing that no endings were bad and that they like her were by no means the mistresses of their destinies
gloria told over to herself the people who had visited them in the gray house at marietta
it had seemed at the time that they were always having companyshe had indulged in an unspoken conviction that each guest was ever afterward slightly indebted to her
they owed her a sort of moral ten dollars apiece and should she ever be in need she might so to speak borrow from them this visionary currency
but they were gone scattered like chaff mysteriously and subtly vanished in essence or in fact
by christmas gloria's conviction that she should join anthony had returned no longer as a sudden emotion but as a recurrent need
she decided to write him word of her coming but postponed the announcement upon the advice of mr haight who expected almost weekly that the case was coming up for trial
one day early in january as she was walking on fifth avenue bright now with uniforms and hung with the flags of the virtuous nations she met rachael barnes whom she had not seen for nearly a year
even rachael whom she had grown to dislike was a relief from ennui and together they went to the ritz for tea
after a second cocktail they became enthusiastic
they liked each other
they talked about their husbands rachael in that tone of public vainglory with private reservations in which wives are wont to speak
rodman's abroad in the quartermaster corps
he's a captain
he was bound he would go and he didn't think he could get into anything else
anthony's in the infantry
the words in their relation to the cocktail gave gloria a sort of glow
with each sip she approached a warm and comforting patriotism
by the way said rachael half an hour later as they were leaving can't you come up to dinner tomorrow night
i'm having two awfully sweet officers who are just going overseas
i think we ought to do all we can to make it attractive for them
gloria accepted gladly
she took down the addressrecognizing by its number a fashionable apartment building on park avenue
it's been awfully good to have seen you rachael
it's been wonderful
i've wanted to
with these three sentences a certain night in marietta two summers before when anthony and rachael had been unnecessarily attentive to each other was forgivengloria forgave rachael rachael forgave gloria
also it was forgiven that rachael had been witness to the greatest disaster in the lives of mr and mrs anthony patch  compromising with events time moves along
the wiles of captain collins  the two officers were captains of the popular craft machine gunnery
at dinner they referred to themselves with conscious boredom as members of the suicide clubin those days every recondite branch of the service referred to itself as the suicide club
one of the captainsrachael's captain gloria observedwas a tall horsy man of thirty with a pleasant mustache and ugly teeth
the other captain collins was chubby pinkfaced and inclined to laugh with abandon every time he caught gloria's eye
he took an immediate fancy to her and throughout dinner showered her with inane compliments
with her second glass of champagne gloria decided that for the first time in months she was thoroughly enjoying herself
after dinner it was suggested that they all go somewhere and dance
the two officers supplied themselves with bottles of liquor from rachael's sideboarda law forbade service to the militaryand so equipped they went through innumerable fox trots in several glittering caravanseries along broadway faithfully alternating partnerswhile gloria became more and more uproarious and more and more amusing to the pinkfaced captain who seldom bothered to remove his genial smile at all
at eleven o'clock to her great surprise she was in the minority for staying out
the others wanted to return to rachael's apartmentto get some more liquor they said
gloria argued persistently that captain collins's flask was half fullshe had just seen itthen catching rachael's eye she received an unmistakable wink
she deduced confusedly that her hostess wanted to get rid of the officers and assented to being bundled into a taxicab outside
captain wolf sat on the left with rachael on his knees
captain collins sat in the middle and as he settled himself he slipped his arm about gloria's shoulder
it rested there lifelessly for a moment and then tightened like a vise
he leaned over her
you're awfully pretty he whispered
thank you kindly sir
she was neither pleased nor annoyed
before anthony came so many arms had done likewise that it had become little more than a gesture sentimental but without significance
up in rachael's long front room a low fire and two lamps shaded with orange silk gave all the light so that the corners were full of deep and somnolent shadows
the hostess moving about in a darkfigured gown of loose chiffon seemed to accentuate the already sensuous atmosphere
for a while they were all four together tasting the sandwiches that waited on the tea tablethen gloria found herself alone with captain collins on the fireside lounge rachael and captain wolf had withdrawn to the other side of the room where they were conversing in subdued voices
i wish you weren't married said collins his face a ludicrous travesty of in all seriousness
why
she held out her glass to be filled with a highball
don't drink any more he urged her frowning
why not
you'd be nicerif you didn't
gloria caught suddenly the intended suggestion of the remark the atmosphere he was attempting to create
she wanted to laughyet she realized that there was nothing to laugh at
she had been enjoying the evening and she had no desire to go homeat the same time it hurt her pride to be flirted with on just that level
pour me another drink she insisted
please  oh don't be ridiculous
she cried in exasperation
very well
he yielded with ill grace
then his arm was about her again and again she made no protest
but when his pink cheek came close she leaned away
you're awfully sweet he said with an aimless air
she began to sing softly wishing now that he would take down his arm
suddenly her eye fell on an intimate scene across the roomrachael and captain wolf were engrossed in a long kiss
gloria shivered slightlyshe knew not why
pink face approached again
you shouldn't look at them he whispered
almost immediately his other arm was around her  his breath was on her cheek
again absurdity triumphed over disgust and her laugh was a weapon that needed no edge of words
oh i thought you were a sport he was saying
what's a sport
why a person that likes toto enjoy life
is kissing you generally considered a joyful affair
they were interrupted as rachael and captain wolf appeared suddenly before them
it's late gloria said rachaelshe was flushed and her hair was dishevelled
you'd better stay here all night
for an instant gloria thought the officers were being dismissed
then she understood and understanding got to her feet as casually as she was able
uncomprehendingly rachael continued  you can have the room just off this one
i can lend you everything you need
collins's eyes implored her like a dog's captain wolf's arm had settled familiarly around rachael's waist they were waiting
but the lure of promiscuity colorful various labyrinthine and ever a little odorous and stale had no call or promise for gloria
had she so desired she would have remained without hesitation without regret as it was she could face coolly the six hostile and offended eyes that followed her out into the hall with forced politeness and hollow words
he wasn't even sport enough to try to take me home she thought in the taxi and then with a quick surge of resentment how utterly common
gallantry  in february she had an experience of quite a different sort
tudor baird an ancient flame a young man whom at one time she had fully intended to marry came to new york by way of the aviation corps and called upon her
they went several times to the theatre and within a week to her great enjoyment he was as much in love with her as ever
quite deliberately she brought it about realizing too late that she had done a mischief
he reached the point of sitting with her in miserable silence whenever they went out together
a scroll and keys man at yale he possessed the correct reticences of a good egg the correct notions of chivalry and noblesse obligeand of course but unfortunately the correct biases and the correct lack of ideasall those traits which anthony had taught her to despise but which nevertheless she rather admired
unlike the majority of his type she found that he was not a bore
he was handsome witty in a light way and when she was with him she felt that because of some quality he possessedcall it stupidity loyalty sentimentality or something not quite as definite as any of the threehe would have done anything in his power to please her
he told her this among other things very correctly and with a ponderous manliness that masked a real suffering
loving him not at all she grew sorry for him and kissed him sentimentally one night because he was so charming a relic of a vanishing generation which lived a priggish and graceful illusion and was being replaced by less gallant fools
afterward she was glad she had kissed him for next day when his plane fell fifteen hundred feet at mineola a piece of a gasolene engine smashed through his heart
gloria alone  when mr haight told her that the trial would not take place until autumn she decided that without telling anthony she would go into the movies
when he saw her successful both histrionically and financially when he saw that she could have her will of joseph bloeckman yielding nothing in return he would lose his silly prejudices
she lay awake half one night planning her career and enjoying her successes in anticipation and the next morning she called up films par excellence
mr bloeckman was in europe
but the idea had gripped her so strongly this time that she decided to go the rounds of the moving picture employment agencies
as so often had been the case her sense of smell worked against her good intentions
the employment agency smelt as though it had been dead a very long time
she waited five minutes inspecting her unprepossessing competitorsthen she walked briskly out into the farthest recesses of central park and remained so long that she caught a cold
she was trying to air the employment agency out of her walking suit
in the spring she began to gather from anthony's lettersnot from any one in particular but from their culminative effectthat he did not want her to come south
curiously repeated excuses that seemed to haunt him by their very insufficiency occurred with freudian regularity
he set them down in each letter as though he feared he had forgotten them the last time as though it were desperately necessary to impress her with them
and the dilutions of his letters with affectionate diminutives began to be mechanical and unspontaneousalmost as though having completed the letter he had looked it over and literally stuck them in like epigrams in an oscar wilde play
she jumped to the solution rejected it was angry and depressed by turnsfinally she shut her mind to it proudly and allowed an increasing coolness to creep into her end of the correspondence
of late she had found a good deal to occupy her attention
several aviators whom she had met through tudor baird came into new york to see her and two other ancient beaux turned up stationed at camp dix
as these men were ordered overseas they so to speak handed her down to their friends
but after another rather disagreeable experience with a potential captain collins she made it plain that when any one was introduced to her he should be under no misapprehensions as to her status and personal intentions
when summer came she learned like anthony to watch the officers' casualty list taking a sort of melancholy pleasure in hearing of the death of some one with whom she had once danced a german and in identifying by name the younger brothers of former suitorsthinking as the drive toward paris progressed that here at length went the world to inevitable and wellmerited destruction
she was twentyseven
her birthday fled by scarcely noticed
years before it had frightened her when she became twenty to some extent when she reached twentysixbut now she looked in the glass with calm selfapproval seeing the british freshness of her complexion and her figure boyish and slim as of old
she tried not to think of anthony
it was as though she were writing to a stranger
she told her friends that he had been made a corporal and was annoyed when they were politely unimpressed
one night she wept because she was sorry for himhad he been even slightly responsive she would have gone to him without hesitation on the first trainwhatever he was doing he needed to be taken care of spiritually and she felt that now she would be able to do even that
recently without his continual drain upon her moral strength she found herself wonderfully revived
before he left she had been inclined through sheer association to brood on her wasted opportunitiesnow she returned to her normal state of mind strong disdainful existing each day for each day's worth
she bought a doll and dressed it one week she wept over ethan frome the next she revelled in some novels of galsworthy's whom she liked for his power of recreating by spring in darkness that illusion of young romantic love to which women look forever forward and forever back
in october anthony's letters multiplied became almost franticthen suddenly ceased
for a worried month it needed all her powers of control to refrain from leaving immediately for mississippi
then a telegram told her that he had been in the hospital and that she could expect him in new york within ten days
like a figure in a dream he came back into her life across the ballroom on that november eveningand all through long hours that held familiar gladness she took him close to her breast nursing an illusion of happiness and security she had not thought that she would know again
discomfiture of the generals  after a week anthony's regiment went back to the mississippi camp to be discharged
the officers shut themselves up in the compartments on the pullman cars and drank the whiskey they had bought in new york and in the coaches the soldiers got as drunk as possible alsoand pretended whenever the train stopped at a village that they were just returned from france where they had practically put an end to the german army
as they all wore overseas caps and claimed that they had not had time to have their gold service stripes sewed on the yokelry of the seaboard were much impressed and asked them how they liked the trenchesto which they replied oh boy with great smacking of tongues and shaking of heads
some one took a piece of chalk and scrawled on the side of the train we won the warnow we're going home and the officers laughed and let it stay
they were all getting what swagger they could out of this ignominious return
as they rumbled on toward camp anthony was uneasy lest he should find dot awaiting him patiently at the station
to his relief he neither saw nor heard anything of her and thinking that were she still in town she would certainly attempt to communicate with him he concluded that she had gonewhither he neither knew nor cared
he wanted only to return to gloriagloria reborn and wonderfully alive
when eventually he was discharged he left his company on the rear of a great truck with a crowd who had given tolerant almost sentimental cheers for their officers especially for captain dunning
the captain on his part had addressed them with tears in his eyes as to the pleasure etc and the work etc and time not wasted etc and duty etc
it was very dull and human having given ear to it anthony whose mind was freshened by his week in new york renewed his deep loathing for the military profession and all it connoted
in their childish hearts two out of every three professional officers considered that wars were made for armies and not armies for wars
he rejoiced to see general and fieldofficers riding desolately about the barren camp deprived of their commands
he rejoiced to hear the men in his company laugh scornfully at the inducements tendered them to remain in the army
they were to attend schools
he knew what these schools were
two days later he was with gloria in new york
another winter  late one february afternoon anthony came into the apartment and groping through the little hall pitchdark in the winter dusk found gloria sitting by the window
she turned as he came in
what did mr haight have to say
she asked listlessly
nothing he answered usual thing
next month perhaps
she looked at him closely her ear attuned to his voice caught the slightest thickness in the dissyllable
you've been drinking she remarked dispassionately
couple glasses
oh
he yawned in the armchair and there was a moment's silence between them
then she demanded suddenly  did you go to mr haight
tell me the truth
no
he smiled weakly
as a matter of fact i didn't have time
i thought you didn't go
he sent for you
i don't give a damn
i'm sick of waiting around his office
you'd think he was doing me a favor
he glanced at gloria as though expecting moral support but she had turned back to her contemplation of the dubious and unprepossessing outofdoors
i feel rather weary of life today he offered tentatively
still she was silent
i met a fellow and we talked in the biltmore bar
the dusk had suddenly deepened but neither of them made any move to turn on the lights
lost in heaven knew what contemplation they sat there until a flurry of snow drew a languid sigh from gloria
what've you been doing
he asked finding the silence oppressive
reading a magazineall full of idiotic articles by prosperous authors about how terrible it is for poor people to buy silk shirts
and while i was reading it i could think of nothing except how i wanted a gray squirrel coatand how we can't afford one
yes we can
oh no
oh yes
if you want a fur coat you can have one
her voice coming through the dark held an implication of scorn
you mean we can sell another bond
if necessary
i don't want to go without things
we have spent a lot though since i've been back
oh shut up
she said in irritation
why
because i'm sick and tired of hearing you talk about what we've spent or what we've done
you came back two months ago and we've been on some sort of a party practically every night since
we've both wanted to go out and we've gone
well you haven't heard me complain have you
but all you do is whine whine whine
i don't care any more what we do or what becomes of us and at least i'm consistent
but i will not tolerate your complaining and calamityhowling  you're not very pleasant yourself sometimes you know
i'm under no obligations to be
you're not making any attempt to make things different
but i am  huh
seems to me i've heard that before
this morning you weren't going to touch another thing to drink until you'd gotten a position
and you didn't even have the spunk to go to mr haight when he sent for you about the suit
anthony got to his feet and switched on the lights
see here
he cried blinking i'm getting sick of that sharp tongue of yours
well what are you going to do about it
do you think i'm particularly happy
he continued ignoring her question
do you think i don't know we're not living as we ought to
in an instant gloria stood trembling beside him
i won't stand it
she burst out
i won't be lectured to
you and your suffering
you're just a pitiful weakling and you always have been
they faced one another idiotically each of them unable to impress the other each of them tremendously achingly bored
then she went into the bedroom and shut the door behind her
his return had brought into the foreground all their prebellum exasperations
prices had risen alarmingly and in perverse ratio their income had shrunk to a little over half of its original size
there had been the large retainer's fee to mr haight there were stocks bought at one hundred now down to thirty and forty and other investments that were not paying at all
during the previous spring gloria had been given the alternative of leaving the apartment or of signing a year's lease at two hundred and twentyfive a month
she had signed it
inevitably as the necessity for economy had increased they found themselves as a pair quite unable to save
the old policy of prevarication was resorted to
weary of their incapabilities they chattered of what they would doohtomorrow of how they would stop going on parties and of how anthony would go to work
but when dark came down gloria accustomed to an engagement every night would feel the ancient restlessness creeping over her
she would stand in the doorway of the bedroom chewing furiously at her fingers and sometimes meeting anthony's eyes as he glanced up from his book
then the telephone and her nerves would relax she would answer it with illconcealed eagerness
some one was coming up for just a few minutesand oh the weariness of pretense the appearance of the wine table the revival of their jaded spiritsand the awakening like the midpoint of a sleepless night in which they moved
as the winter passed with the march of the returning troops along fifth avenue they became more and more aware that since anthony's return their relations had entirely changed
after that reflowering of tenderness and passion each of them had returned into some solitary dream unshared by the other and what endearments passed between them passed it seemed from empty heart to empty heart echoing hollowly the departure of what they knew at last was gone
anthony had again made the rounds of the metropolitan newspapers and had again been refused encouragement by a motley of office boys telephone girls and city editors
the word was we're keeping any vacancies open for our own men who are still in france
then late in march his eye fell on an advertisement in the morning paper and in consequence he found at last the semblance of an occupation
                              you can sell
why not earn while you learn  our salesmen make  weekly
                              there followed an address on madison avenue and instructions to appear at one o'clock that afternoon
gloria glancing over his shoulder after one of their usual late breakfasts saw him regarding it idly
why don't you try it
she suggested
ohit's one of these crazy schemes
it might not be
at least it'd be experience
at her urging he went at one o'clock to the appointed address where he found himself one of a dense miscellany of men waiting in front of the door
they ranged from a messengerboy evidently misusing his company's time to an immemorial individual with a gnarled body and a gnarled cane
some of the men were seedy with sunken cheeks and puffy pink eyesothers were young possibly still in high school
after a jostled fifteen minutes during which they all eyed one another with apathetic suspicion there appeared a smart young shepherd clad in a waistline suit and wearing the manner of an assistant rector who herded them upstairs into a large room which resembled a schoolroom and contained innumerable desks
here the prospective salesmen sat downand again waited
after an interval a platform at the end of the hall was clouded with half a dozen sober but sprightly men who with one exception took seats in a semicircle facing the audience
the exception was the man who seemed the soberest the most sprightly and the youngest of the lot and who advanced to the front of the platform
the audience scrutinized him hopefully
he was rather small and rather pretty with the commercial rather than the thespian sort of prettiness
he had straight blond bushy brows and eyes that were almost preposterously honest and as he reached the edge of his rostrum he seemed to throw these eyes out into the audience simultaneously extending his arm with two fingers outstretched
then while he rocked himself to a state of balance an expectant silence settled over the hall
with perfect assurance the young man had taken his listeners in hand and his words when they came were steady and confident and of the school of straight from the shoulder
men
he began and paused
the word died with a prolonged echo at the end of the hall the faces regarding him hopefully cynically wearily were alike arrested engrossed
six hundred eyes were turned slightly upward
with an even graceless flow that reminded anthony of the rolling of bowling balls he launched himself into the sea of exposition
this bright and sunny morning you picked up your favorite newspaper and you found an advertisement which made the plain unadorned statement that you could sell
that was all it saidit didn't say 'what' it didn't say 'how' it didn't say 'why'
it just made one single solitary assertion that you and you and youbusiness of pointingcould sell
now my job isn't to make a success of you because every man is born a success he makes himself a failure it's not to teach you how to talk because each man is a natural orator and only makes himself a clam my business is to tell you one thing in a way that will make you know itit's to tell you that you and you and you have the heritage of money and prosperity waiting for you to come and claim it
at this point an irishman of saturnine appearance rose from his desk near the rear of the hall and went out
that man thinks he'll go look for it in the beer parlor around the corner
laughter
he won't find it there
once upon a time i looked for it there myself laughter but that was before i did what every one of you men no matter how young or how old how poor or how rich a faint ripple of satirical laughter can do
it was before i foundmyself
now i wonder if any of you men know what a 'heart talk' is
a 'heart talk' is a little book in which i started about five years ago to write down what i had discovered were the principal reasons for a man's failure and the principal reasons for a man's successfrom john d rockerfeller back to john d napoleon laughter and before that back in the days when abel sold his birthright for a mess of pottage
there are now one hundred of these 'heart talks'
those of you who are sincere who are interested in our proposition above all who are dissatisfied with the way things are breaking for you at present will be handed one to take home with you as you go out yonder door this afternoon
now in my own pocket i have four letters just received concerning 'heart talks'
these letters have names signed to them that are familiar in every household in the usa
listen to this one from detroit                                       dear mr carleton  i want to order three thousand more copies of 'heart talks' for distribution among my salesmen
they have done more for getting work out of the men than any bonus proposition ever considered
i read them myself constantly and i desire to heartily congratulate you on getting at the roots of the biggest problem that faces our generation todaythe problem of salesmanship
the rock bottom on which the country is founded is the problem of salesmanship
with many felicitations i am  yours very cordially  henry w
terral
                              he brought the name out in three long booming triumphanciespausing for it to produce its magical effect
then he read two more letters one from a manufacturer of vacuum cleaners and one from the president of the great northern doily company
and now he continued i'm going to tell you in a few words what the proposition is that's going to make those of you who go into it in the right spirit
simply put it's this 'heart talks' have been incorporated as a company
we're going to put these little pamphlets into the hands of every big business organization every salesman and every man who knowsi don't say 'thinks' i say 'knows'that he can sell
we are offering some of the stock of the 'heart talks' concern upon the market and in order that the distribution may be as wide as possible and in order also that we can furnish a living concrete fleshandblood example of what salesmanship is or rather what it may be we're going to give those of you who are the real thing a chance to sell that stock
now i don't care what you've tried to sell before or how you've tried to sell it
it don't matter how old you are or how young you are
i only want to know two thingsfirst do you want success and second will you work for it
my name is sammy carleton
not 'mr'
carleton but just plain sammy
i'm a regular nononsense man with no fancy frills about me
i want you to call me sammy
now this is all i'm going to say to you today
tomorrow i want those of you who have thought it over and have read the copy of 'heart talks' which will be given to you at the door to come back to this same room at this same time then we'll go into the proposition further and i'll explain to you what i've found the principles of success to be
i'm going to make you feel that you and you and you can sell
mr carleton's voice echoed for a moment through the hall and then died away
to the stamping of many feet anthony was pushed and jostled with the crowd out of the room
further adventures with heart talks  with an accompaniment of ironic laughter anthony told gloria the story of his commercial adventure
but she listened without amusement
you're going to give up again
she demanded coldly
whyyou don't expect me to  i never expected anything of you
he hesitated
welli can't see the slightest benefit in laughing myself sick over this sort of affair
if there's anything older than the old story it's the new twist
it required an astonishing amount of moral energy on gloria's part to intimidate him into returning and when he reported next day somewhat depressed from his perusal of the senile bromides skittishly set forth in heart talks on ambition he found only fifty of the original three hundred awaiting the appearance of the vital and compelling sammy carleton
mr carleton's powers of vitality and compulsion were this time exercised in elucidating that magnificent piece of speculationhow to sell
it seemed that the approved method was to state one's proposition and then to say not and now will you buy
this was not the wayoh nothe way was to state one's proposition and then having reduced one's adversary to a state of exhaustion to deliver oneself of the categorical imperative now see here
you've taken up my time explaining this matter to you
you've admitted my pointsall i want to ask is how many do you want
as mr carleton piled assertion upon assertion anthony began to feel a sort of disgusted confidence in him
the man appeared to know what he was talking about
obviously prosperous he had risen to the position of instructing others
it did not occur to anthony that the type of man who attains commercial success seldom knows how or why and as in his grandfather's case when he ascribes reasons the reasons are generally inaccurate and absurd
anthony noted that of the numerous old men who had answered the original advertisement only two had returned and that among the thirty odd who assembled on the third day to get actual selling instructions from mr carleton only one gray head was in evidence
these thirty were eager converts with their mouths they followed the working of mr carleton's mouth they swayed in their seats with enthusiasm and in the intervals of his talk they spoke to each other in tense approving whispers
yet of the chosen few who in the words of mr carleton were determined to get those deserts that rightly and truly belonged to them less than half a dozen combined even a modicum of personal appearance with that great gift of being a pusher
but they were told that they were all natural pushersit was merely necessary that they should believe with a sort of savage passion in what they were selling
he even urged each one to buy some stock himself if possible in order to increase his own sincerity
on the fifth day then anthony sallied into the street with all the sensations of a man wanted by the police
acting according to instructions he selected a tall office building in order that he might ride to the top story and work downward stopping in every office that had a name on the door
but at the last minute he hesitated
perhaps it would be more practicable to acclimate himself to the chilly atmosphere which he felt was awaiting him by trying a few offices on say madison avenue
he went into an arcade that seemed only semiprosperous and seeing a sign which read percy b weatherbee architect he opened the door heroically and entered
a starchy young woman looked up questioningly
can i see mr
weatherbee
he wondered if his voice sounded tremulous
she laid her hand tentatively on the telephonereceiver
what's the name please
he wouldn'tahknow me
he wouldn't know my name
what's your business with him
you an insurance agent
oh no nothing like that
denied anthony hurriedly
oh no
it's ait's a personal matter
he wondered if he should have said this
it had all sounded so simple when mr carleton had enjoined his flock  don't allow yourself to be kept out
show them you've made up your mind to talk to them and they'll listen
the girl succumbed to anthony's pleasant melancholy face and in a moment the door to the inner room opened and admitted a tall splayfooted man with slicked hair
he approached anthony with illconcealed impatience
you wanted to see me on a personal matter
anthony quailed
i wanted to talk to you he said defiantly
about what
it'll take some time to explain
well what's it about
mr weatherbee's voice indicated rising irritation
then anthony straining at each word each syllable began  i don't know whether or not you've ever heard of a series of pamphlets called 'heart talks'  good grief
cried percy b weatherbee architect are you trying to touch my heart
no it's business
'heart talks' have been incorporated and we're putting some shares on the market  his voice faded slowly off harassed by a fixed and contemptuous stare from his unwilling prey
for another minute he struggled on increasingly sensitive entangled in his own words
his confidence oozed from him in great retching emanations that seemed to be sections of his own body
almost mercifully percy b weatherbee architect terminated the interview  good grief
he exploded in disgust and you call that a personal matter
he whipped about and strode into his private office banging the door behind him
not daring to look at the stenographer anthony in some shameful and mysterious way got himself from the room
perspiring profusely he stood in the hall wondering why they didn't come and arrest him in every hurried look he discerned infallibly a glance of scorn
after an hour and with the help of two strong whiskies he brought himself up to another attempt
he walked into a plumber's shop but when he mentioned his business the plumber began pulling on his coat in a great hurry gruffly announcing that he had to go to lunch
anthony remarked politely that it was futile to try to sell a man anything when he was hungry and the plumber heartily agreed
this episode encouraged anthony he tried to think that had the plumber not been bound for lunch he would at least have listened
passing by a few glittering and formidable bazaars he entered a grocery store
a talkative proprietor told him that before buying any stocks he was going to see how the armistice affected the market
to anthony this seemed almost unfair
in mr carleton's salesman's utopia the only reason prospective buyers ever gave for not purchasing stock was that they doubted it to be a promising investment
obviously a man in that state was almost ludicrously easy game to be brought down merely by the judicious application of the correct selling points
but these menwhy actually they weren't considering buying anything at all
anthony took several more drinks before he approached his fourth man a realestate agent nevertheless he was floored with a coup as decisive as a syllogism
the realestate agent said that he had three brothers in the investment business
viewing himself as a breakerup of homes anthony apologized and went out
after another drink he conceived the brilliant plan of selling the stock to the bartenders along lexington avenue
this occupied several hours for it was necessary to take a few drinks in each place in order to get the proprietor in the proper frame of mind to talk business
but the bartenders one and all contended that if they had any money to buy bonds they would not be bartenders
it was as though they had all convened and decided upon that rejoinder
as he approached a dark and soggy five o'clock he found that they were developing a still more annoying tendency to turn him off with a jest
at five then with a tremendous effort at concentration he decided that he must put more variety into his canvassing
he selected a mediumsized delicatessen store and went in
he felt illuminatingly that the thing to do was to cast a spell not only over the storekeeper but over all the customers as welland perhaps through the psychology of the herd instinct they would buy as an astounded and immediately convinced whole
af'ernoon he began in a loud thick voice
ga l'il prop'sition
if he had wanted silence he obtained it
a sort of awe descended upon the halfdozen women marketing and upon the grayhaired ancient who in cap and apron was slicing chicken
anthony pulled a batch of papers from his flapping briefcase and waved them cheerfully
buy a bon' he suggested good as liberty bon'
the phrase pleased him and he elaborated upon it
better'n liberty bon'
every one these bon's worth two liberty bon's
his mind made a hiatus and skipped to his peroration which he delivered with appropriate gestures these being somewhat marred by the necessity of clinging to the counter with one or both hands
now see here
you taken up my time
i don't want know why you won't buy
i just want you say why
want you say how many  at this point they should have approached him with checkbooks and fountain pens in hand
realizing that they must have missed a cue anthony with the instincts of an actor went back and repeated his finale
now see here
you taken up my time
you followed prop'sition
you agreed 'th reasonin'
now all i want from you is how many lib'ty bon's
see here
broke in a new voice
a portly man whose face was adorned with symmetrical scrolls of yellow hair had come out of a glass cage in the rear of the store and was bearing down upon anthony
see here you
how many
repeated the salesman sternly
you taken up my time  hey you
cried the proprietor i'll have you taken up by the police
you mos' cert'nly won't
returned anthony with fine defiance
all i want know is how many
from here and there in the store went up little clouds of comment and expostulation
how terrible
he's a raving maniac
he's disgracefully drunk
the proprietor grasped anthony's arm sharply
get out or i'll call a policeman
some relics of rationality moved anthony to nod and replace his bonds clumsily in the case
how many
he reiterated doubtfully
the whole force if necessary
thundered his adversary his yellow mustache trembling fiercely
sell 'em all a bon'
with this anthony turned bowed gravely to his late auditors and wabbled from the store
he found a taxicab at the corner and rode home to the apartment
there he fell sound asleep on the sofa and so gloria found him his breath filling the air with an unpleasant pungency his hand still clutching his open brief case
except when anthony was drinking his range of sensation had become less than that of a healthy old man and when prohibition came in july he found that among those who could afford it there was more drinking than ever before
one's host now brought out a bottle upon the slightest pretext
the tendency to display liquor was a manifestation of the same instinct that led a man to deck his wife with jewels
to have liquor was a boast almost a badge of respectability
in the mornings anthony awoke tired nervous and worried
halcyon summer twilights and the purple chill of morning alike left him unresponsive
only for a brief moment every day in the warmth and renewed life of a first highball did his mind turn to those opalescent dreams of future pleasurethe mutual heritage of the happy and the damned
but this was only for a little while
as he grew drunker the dreams faded and he became a confused spectre moving in odd crannies of his own mind full of unexpected devices harshly contemptuous at best and reaching sodden and dispirited depths
one night in june he had quarrelled violently with maury over a matter of the utmost triviality
he remembered dimly next morning that it had been about a broken pint bottle of champagne
maury had told him to sober up and anthony's feelings had been hurt so with an attempted gesture of dignity he had risen from the table and seizing gloria's arm half led half shamed her into a taxicab outside leaving maury with three dinners ordered and tickets for the opera
this sort of semitragic fiasco had become so usual that when they occurred he was no longer stirred into making amends
if gloria protestedand of late she was more likely to sink into contemptuous silencehe would either engage in a bitter defense of himself or else stalk dismally from the apartment
never since the incident on the station platform at redgate had he laid his hands on her in angerthough he was withheld often only by some instinct that itself made him tremble with rage
just as he still cared more for her than for any other creature so did he more intensely and frequently hate her
so far the judges of the appellate division had failed to hand down a decision but after another postponement they finally affirmed the decree of the lower courttwo justices dissenting
a notice of appeal was served upon edward shuttleworth
the case was going to the court of last resort and they were in for another interminable wait
six months perhaps a year
it had grown enormously unreal to them remote and uncertain as heaven
throughout the previous winter one small matter had been a subtle and omnipresent irritantthe question of gloria's gray fur coat
at that time women enveloped in long squirrel wraps could be seen every few yards along fifth avenue
the women were converted to the shape of tops
they seemed porcine and obscene they resembled kept women in the concealing richness the feminine animality of the garment
yetgloria wanted a gray squirrel coat
discussing the matteror rather arguing it for even more than in the first year of their marriage did every discussion take the form of bitter debate full of such phrases as most certainly utterly outrageous it's so nevertheless and the ultraemphatic regardlessthey concluded that they could not afford it
and so gradually it began to stand as a symbol of their growing financial anxiety
to gloria the shrinkage of their income was a remarkable phenomenon without explanation or precedentthat it could happen at all within the space of five years seemed almost an intended cruelty conceived and executed by a sardonic god
when they were married seventyfive hundred a year had seemed ample for a young couple especially when augmented by the expectation of many millions
gloria had failed to realize that it was decreasing not only in amount but in purchasing power until the payment of mr haight's retaining fee of fifteen thousand dollars made the fact suddenly and startlingly obvious
when anthony was drafted they had calculated their income at over four hundred a month with the dollar even then decreasing in value but on his return to new york they discovered an even more alarming condition of affairs
they were receiving only fortyfive hundred a year from their investments
and though the suit over the will moved ahead of them like a persistent mirage and the financial dangermark loomed up in the near distance they found nevertheless that living within their income was impossible
so gloria went without the squirrel coat and every day upon fifth avenue she was a little conscious of her wellworn halflength leopard skin now hopelessly oldfashioned
every other month they sold a bond yet when the bills were paid it left only enough to be gulped down hungrily by their current expenses
anthony's calculations showed that their capital would last about seven years longer
so gloria's heart was very bitter for in one week on a prolonged hysterical party during which anthony whimsically divested himself of coat vest and shirt in a theatre and was assisted out by a posse of ushers they spent twice what the gray squirrel coat would have cost
it was november indian summer rather and a warm warm nightwhich was unnecessary for the work of the summer was done
babe ruth had smashed the homerun record for the first time and jack dempsey had broken jess willard's cheekbone out in ohio
over in europe the usual number of children had swollen stomachs from starvation and the diplomats were at their customary business of making the world safe for new wars
in new york city the proletariat were being disciplined and the odds on harvard were generally quoted at five to three
peace had come down in earnest the beginning of new days
up in the bedroom of the apartment on fiftyseventh street gloria lay upon her bed and tossed from side to side sitting up at intervals to throw off a superfluous cover and once asking anthony who was lying awake beside her to bring her a glass of icewater
be sure and put ice in it she said with insistence it isn't cold enough the way it comes from the faucet
looking through the frail curtains she could see the rounded moon over the roofs and beyond it on the sky the yellow glow from times squareand watching the two incongruous lights her mind worked over an emotion or rather an interwoven complex of emotions that had occupied it through the day and the day before that and back to the last time when she could remember having thought clearly and consecutively about anythingwhich must have been while anthony was in the army
she would be twentynine in february
the month assumed an ominous and inescapable significancemaking her wonder through these nebulous halffevered hours whether after all she had not wasted her faintly tired beauty whether there was such a thing as use for any quality bounded by a harsh and inevitable mortality
years before when she was twentyone she had written in her diary beauty is only to be admired only to be lovedto be harvested carefully and then flung at a chosen lover like a gift of roses
it seems to me so far as i can judge clearly at all that my beauty should be used like that  and now all this november day all this desolate day under a sky dirty and white gloria had been thinking that perhaps she had been wrong
to preserve the integrity of her first gift she had looked no more for love
when the first flame and ecstasy had grown dim sunk down departed she had begun preservingwhat
it puzzled her that she no longer knew just what she was preservinga sentimental memory or some profound and fundamental concept of honor
she was doubting now whether there had been any moral issue involved in her way of lifeto walk unworried and unregretful along the gayest of all possible lanes and to keep her pride by being always herself and doing what it seemed beautiful that she should do
from the first little boy in an eton collar whose girl she had been down to the latest casual man whose eyes had grown alert and appreciative as they rested upon her there was needed only that matchless candor she could throw into a look or clothe with an inconsequent clausefor she had talked always in broken clausesto weave about her immeasurable illusions immeasurable distances immeasurable light
to create souls in men to create fine happiness and fine despair she must remain deeply proudproud to be inviolate proud also to be melting to be passionate and possessed
she knew that in her breast she had never wanted children
the reality the earthiness the intolerable sentiment of childbearing the menace to her beautyhad appalled her
she wanted to exist only as a conscious flower prolonging and preserving itself
her sentimentality could cling fiercely to her own illusions but her ironic soul whispered that motherhood was also the privilege of the female baboon
so her dreams were of ghostly children onlythe early the perfect symbols of her early and perfect love for anthony
in the end then her beauty was all that never failed her
she had never seen beauty like her own
what it meant ethically or aesthetically faded before the gorgeous concreteness of her pinkandwhite feet the clean perfectness of her body and the baby mouth that was like the material symbol of a kiss
she would be twentynine in february
as the long night waned she grew supremely conscious that she and beauty were going to make use of these next three months
at first she was not sure for what but the problem resolved itself gradually into the old lure of the screen
she was in earnest now
no material want could have moved her as this fear moved her
no matter for anthony anthony the poor in spirit the weak and broken man with bloodshot eyes for whom she still had moments of tenderness
no matter
she would be twentynine in februarya hundred days so many days she would go to bloeckman tomorrow
with the decision came relief
it cheered her that in some manner the illusion of beauty could be sustained or preserved perhaps in celluloid after the reality had vanished
welltomorrow
the next day she felt weak and ill she tried to go out and saved herself from collapse only by clinging to a mail box near the front door
the martinique elevator boy helped her upstairs and she waited on the bed for anthony's return without energy to unhook her brassiere
for five days she was down with influenza which just as the month turned the corner into winter ripened into double pneumonia
in the feverish perambulations of her mind she prowled through a house of bleak unlighted rooms hunting for her mother
all she wanted was to be a little girl to be efficiently taken care of by some yielding yet superior power stupider and steadier than herself
it seemed that the only lover she had ever wanted was a lover in a dream
odi profanum vulgus  one day in the midst of gloria's illness there occurred a curious incident that puzzled miss mcgovern the trained nurse for some time afterward
it was noon but the room in which the patient lay was dark and quiet
miss mcgovern was standing near the bed mixing some medicine when mrs patch who had apparently been sound asleep sat up and began to speak vehemently  millions of people she said swarming like rats chattering like apes smelling like all hell  monkeys
or lice i suppose
for one really exquisite palace  on long island sayor even in greenwich  for one palace full of pictures from the old world and exquisite thingswith avenues of trees and green lawns and a view of the blue sea and lovely people about in slick dresses 
i'd sacrifice a hundred thousand of them a million of them
she raised her hand feebly and snapped her fingers
i care nothing for themunderstand me
the look she bent upon miss mcgovern at the conclusion of this speech was curiously elfin curiously intent
then she gave a short little laugh polished with scorn and tumbling backward fell off again to sleep
miss mcgovern was bewildered
she wondered what were the hundred thousand things that mrs patch would sacrifice for her palace
dollars she supposedyet it had not sounded exactly like dollars
the movies  it was february seven days before her birthday and the great snow that had filled up the crossstreets as dirt fills the cracks in a floor had turned to slush and was being escorted to the gutters by the hoses of the streetcleaning department
the wind none the less bitter for being casual whipped in through the open windows of the living room bearing with it the dismal secrets of the areaway and clearing the patch apartment of stale smoke in its cheerless circulation
gloria wrapped in a warm kimona came into the chilly room and taking up the telephone receiver called joseph bloeckman
do you mean mr joseph black
demanded the telephone girl at films par excellence
bloeckman joseph bloeckman
blo  mr joseph bloeckman has changed his name to black
do you want him
whyyes
she remembered nervously that she had once called him blockhead to his face
his office was reached by courtesy of two additional female voices the last was a secretary who took her name
only with the flow through the transmitter of his own familiar but faintly impersonal tone did she realize that it had been three years since they had met
and he had changed his name to black
can you see me
she suggested lightly
it's on a business matter really
i'm going into the movies at lastif i can
i'm awfully glad
i've always thought you'd like it
do you think you can get me a trial
she demanded with the arrogance peculiar to all beautiful women to all women who have ever at any time considered themselves beautiful
he assured her that it was merely a question of when she wanted the trial
any time
well he'd phone later in the day and let her know a convenient hour
the conversation closed with conventional padding on both sides
then from three o'clock to five she sat close to the telephonewith no result
but next morning came a note that contented and excited her                                       my dear gloria  just by luck a matter came to my attention that i think will be just suited to you
i would like to see you start with something that would bring you notice
at the same time if a very beautiful girl of your sort is put directly into a picture next to one of the rather shopworn stars with which every company is afflicted tongues would very likely wag
but there is a flapper part in a percy b debris production that i think would be just suited to you and would bring you notice
willa sable plays opposite gaston mears in a sort of character part and your part i believe would be her younger sister  anyway percy b debris who is directing the picture says if you'll come to the studios day after tomorrow thursday he will run off a test
if ten o'clock is suited to you i will meet you there at that time  with all good wishes  ever faithfully  joseph black
                              gloria had decided that anthony was to know nothing of this until she had obtained a definite position and accordingly she was dressed and out of the apartment next morning before he awoke
her mirror had given her she thought much the same account as ever
she wondered if there were any lingering traces of her sickness
she was still slightly under weight and she had fancied a few days before that her cheeks were a trifle thinnerbut she felt that those were merely transitory conditions and that on this particular day she looked as fresh as ever
she had bought and charged a new hat and as the day was warm she had left the leopard skin coat at home
at the films par excellence studios she was announced over the telephone and told that mr black would be down directly
she looked around her
two girls were being shown about by a little fat man in a slashpocket coat and one of them had indicated a stack of thin parcels piled breasthigh against the wall and extending along for twenty feet
that's studio mail explained the fat man
pictures of the stars who are with 'films par excellence'
oh
each one's autographed by florence kelley or gaston mears or mack dodge he winked confidentially
at least when minnie mcglook out in sauk center gets the picture she wrote for she thinks it's autographed
just a stamp
sure
it'd take 'em a good eighthour day to autograph half of 'em
they say mary pickford's studio mail costs her fifty thousand a year
say
sure
fifty thousand
but it's the best kinda advertising there is  they drifted out of earshot and almost immediately bloeckman appearedbloeckman a dark suave gentleman gracefully engaged in the middle forties who greeted her with courteous warmth and told her she had not changed a bit in three years
he led the way into a great hall as large as an armory and broken intermittently with busy sets and blinding rows of unfamiliar light
each piece of scenery was marked in large white letters gaston mears company mack dodge company or simply films par excellence
ever been in a studio before
never have
she liked it
there was no heavy closeness of greasepaint no scent of soiled and tawdry costumes which years before had revolted her behind the scenes of a musical comedy
this work was done in the clean mornings the appurtenances seemed rich and gorgeous and new
on a set that was joyous with manchu hangings a perfect chinaman was going through a scene according to megaphone directions as the great glittering machine ground out its ancient moral tale for the edification of the national mind
a redheaded man approached them and spoke with familiar deference to bloeckman who answered  hello debris
want you to meet mrs patch mrs patch wants to go into pictures as i explained to you all right now where do we go
mr debristhe great percy b debris thought gloriashowed them to a set which represented the interior of an office
some chairs were drawn up around the camera which stood in front of it and the three of them sat down
ever been in a studio before
asked mr debris giving her a glance that was surely the quintessence of keenness
no
well i'll explain exactly what's going to happen
we're going to take what we call a test in order to see how your features photograph and whether you've got natural stage presence and how you respond to coaching
there's no need to be nervous over it
i'll just have the cameraman take a few hundred feet in an episode i've got marked here in the scenario
we can tell pretty much what we want to from that
he produced a typewritten continuity and explained to her the episode she was to enact
it developed that one barbara wainwright had been secretly married to the junior partner of the firm whose office was there represented
entering the deserted office one day by accident she was naturally interested in seeing where her husband worked
the telephone rang and after some hesitation she answered it
she learned that her husband had been struck by an automobile and instantly killed
she was overcome
at first she was unable to realize the truth but finally she succeeded in comprehending it and went into a dead faint on the floor
now that's all we want concluded mr debris
i'm going to stand here and tell you approximately what to do and you're to act as though i wasn't here and just go on do it your own way
you needn't be afraid we're going to judge this too severely
we simply want to get a general idea of your screen personality
i see
you'll find makeup in the room in back of the set
go light on it
very little red
i see repeated gloria nodding
she touched her lips nervously with the tip of her tongue
the test  as she came into the set through the real wooden door and closed it carefully behind her she found herself inconveniently dissatisfied with her clothes
she should have bought a misses' dress for the occasionshe could still wear them and it might have been a good investment if it had accentuated her airy youth
her mind snapped sharply into the momentous present as mr debris's voice came from the glare of the white lights in front
you look around for your husband nowyou don't see him  you're curious about the office  she became conscious of the regular sound of the camera
it worried her
she glanced toward it involuntarily and wondered if she had made up her face correctly
then with a definite effort she forced herself to actand she had never felt that the gestures of her body were so banal so awkward so bereft of grace or distinction
she strolled around the office picking up articles here and there and looking at them inanely
then she scrutinized the ceiling the floor and thoroughly inspected an inconsequential lead pencil on the desk
finally because she could think of nothing else to do and less than nothing to express she forced a smile
all right
now the phone rings
tingalingaling
hesitate and then answer it
she hesitatedand then too quickly she thought picked up the receiver
hello
her voice was hollow and unreal
the words rang in the empty set like the ineffectualities of a ghost
the absurdities of their requirements appalled herdid they expect that on an instant's notice she could put herself in the place of this preposterous and unexplained character
 no  no not yet
now listen 'john sumner has just been knocked over by an automobile and instantly killed'
gloria let her baby mouth drop slowly open
then  now hang up
with a bang
she obeyed clung to the table with her eyes wide and staring
at length she was feeling slightly encouraged and her confidence increased
my god
she cried
her voice was good she thought
oh my god
now faint
she collapsed forward to her knees and throwing her body outward on the ground lay without breathing
all right
called mr debris
that's enough thank you
that's plenty
get upthat's enough
gloria arose mustering her dignity and brushing off her skirt
awful
she remarked with a cool laugh though her heart was bumping tumultuously
terrible wasn't it
did you mind it
said mr debris smiling blandly
did it seem hard
i can't tell anything about it until i have it run off
of course not she agreed trying to attach some sort of meaning to his remarkand failing
it was just the sort of thing he would have said had he been trying not to encourage her
a few moments later she left the studio
bloeckman had promised that she should hear the result of the test within the next few days
too proud to force any definite comment she felt a baffling uncertainty and only now when the step had at last been taken did she realize how the possibility of a successful screen career had played in the back of her mind for the past three years
that night she tried to tell over to herself the elements that might decide for or against her
whether or not she had used enough makeup worried her and as the part was that of a girl of twenty she wondered if she had not been just a little too grave
about her acting she was least of all satisfied
her entrance had been abominablein fact not until she reached the phone had she displayed a shred of poiseand then the test had been over
if they had only realized
she wished that she could try it again
a mad plan to call up in the morning and ask for a new trial took possession of her and as suddenly faded
it seemed neither politic nor polite to ask another favor of bloeckman
the third day of waiting found her in a highly nervous condition
she had bitten the insides of her mouth until they were raw and smarting and burnt unbearably when she washed them with listerine
she had quarrelled so persistently with anthony that he had left the apartment in a cold fury
but because he was intimidated by her exceptional frigidity he called up an hour afterward apologized and said he was having dinner at the amsterdam club the only one in which he still retained membership
it was after one o'clock and she had breakfasted at eleven so deciding to forego luncheon she started for a walk in the park
at three there would be a mail
she would be back by three
it was an afternoon of premature spring
water was drying on the walks and in the park little girls were gravely wheeling white dollbuggies up and down under the thin trees while behind them followed bored nurserymaids in two's discussing with each other those tremendous secrets that are peculiar to nurserymaids
two o'clock by her little gold watch
she should have a new watch one made in a platinum oblong and incrusted with diamondsbut those cost even more than squirrel coats and of course they were out of her reach now like everything elseunless perhaps the right letter was awaiting her  in about an hour  fiftyeight minutes exactly
ten to get there left fortyeight  fortyseven now   little girls soberly wheeling their buggies along the damp sunny walks
the nurserymaids chattering in pairs about their inscrutable secrets
here and there a raggedy man seated upon newspapers spread on a drying bench related not to the radiant and delightful afternoon but to the dirty snow that slept exhausted in obscure corners waiting for extermination  ages later coming into the dim hall she saw the martinique elevator boy standing incongruously in the light of the stainedglass window
is there any mail for us
she asked
upstays madame
the switchboard squawked abominably and gloria waited while he ministered to the telephone
she sickened as the elevator groaned its way upthe floors passed like the slow lapse of centuries each one ominous accusing significant
the letter a white leprous spot lay upon the dirty tiles of the hall                                       my dear gloria  we had the test run off yesterday afternoon and mr debris seemed to think that for the part he had in mind he needed a younger woman
he said that the acting was not bad and that there was a small character part supposed to be a very haughty rich widow that he thought you might                                       desolately gloria raised her glance until it fell out across the areaway
but she found she could not see the opposite wall for her gray eyes were full of tears
she walked into the bedroom the letter crinkled tightly in her hand and sank down upon her knees before the long mirror on the wardrobe floor
this was her twentyninth birthday and the world was melting away before her eyes
she tried to think that it had been the makeup but her emotions were too profound too overwhelming for any consolation that the thought conveyed
she strained to see until she could feel the flesh on her temples pull forward
yesthe cheeks were ever so faintly thin the corners of the eyes were lined with tiny wrinkles
the eyes were different
why they were different
 and then suddenly she knew how tired her eyes were
oh my pretty face she whispered passionately grieving
oh my pretty face
oh i don't want to live without my pretty face
oh what's happened  then she slid toward the mirror and as in the test sprawled face downward upon the floorand lay there sobbing
it was the first awkward movement she had ever made
chapter iii   no matter
within another year anthony and gloria had become like players who had lost their costumes lacking the pride to continue on the note of tragedyso that when mrs and miss hulme of kansas city cut them dead in the plaza one evening it was only that mrs and miss hulme like most people abominated mirrors of their atavistic selves
their new apartment for which they paid eightyfive dollars a month was situated on claremont avenue which is two blocks from the hudson in the dim hundreds
they had lived there a month when muriel kane came to see them late one afternoon
it was a reproachless twilight on the summer side of spring
anthony lay upon the lounge looking up one hundred and twentyseventh street toward the river near which he could just see a single patch of vivid green trees that guaranteed the brummagem umbrageousness of riverside drive
across the water were the palisades crowned by the ugly framework of the amusement parkyet soon it would be dusk and those same iron cobwebs would be a glory against the heavens an enchanted palace set over the smooth radiance of a tropical canal
the streets near the apartment anthony had found were streets where children playedstreets a little nicer than those he had been used to pass on his way to marietta but of the same general sort with an occasional hand organ or hurdygurdy and in the cool of the evening many pairs of young girls walking down to the corner drugstore for ice cream soda and dreaming unlimited dreams under the low heavens
dusk in the streets now and children playing shouting up incoherent ecstatic words that faded out close to the open windowand muriel who had come to find gloria chattering to him from an opaque gloom over across the room
light the lamp why don't we
she suggested
it's getting ghostly in here
with a tired movement he arose and obeyed the gray windowpanes vanished
he stretched himself
he was heavier now his stomach was a limp weight against his belt his flesh had softened and expanded
he was thirtytwo and his mind was a bleak and disordered wreck
have a little drink muriel
not me thanks
i don't use it anymore
what're you doing these days anthony
she asked curiously
well i've been pretty busy with this lawsuit he answered indifferently
it's gone to the court of appealsought to be settled up one way or another by autumn
there's been some objection as to whether the court of appeals has jurisdiction over the matter
muriel made a clicking sound with her tongue and cocked her head on one side
well you tell'em
i never heard of anything taking so long
oh they all do he replied listlessly all will cases
they say it's exceptional to have one settled under four or five years
oh  muriel daringly changed her tack why don't you go to work you laazy
at what
he demanded abruptly
why at anything i suppose
you're still a young man
if that's encouragement i'm much obliged he answered drylyand then with sudden weariness does it bother you particularly that i don't want to work
it doesn't bother mebut it does bother a lot of people who claim  oh god
he said brokenly it seems to me that for three years i've heard nothing about myself but wild stories and virtuous admonitions
i'm tired of it
if you don't want to see us let us alone
i don't bother my former friends
but i need no charity calls and no criticism disguised as good advice then he added apologetically i'm sorrybut really muriel you mustn't talk like a lady slumworker even if you are visiting the lower middle classes
he turned his bloodshot eyes on her reproachfullyeyes that had once been a deep clear blue that were weak now strained and halfruined from reading when he was drunk
why do you say such awful things
she protested
you talk as if you and gloria were in the middle classes
why pretend we're not
i hate people who claim to be great aristocrats when they can't even keep up the appearances of it
do you think a person has to have money to be aristocratic
muriel  the horrified democrat 
why of course
aristocracy's only an admission that certain traits which we call finecourage and honor and beauty and all that sort of thingcan best be developed in a favorable environment where you don't have the warpings of ignorance and necessity
muriel bit her lower lip and waved her head from side to side
well all i say is that if a person comes from a good family they're always nice people
that's the trouble with you and gloria
you think that just because things aren't going your way right now all your old friends are trying to avoid you
you're too sensitive  as a matter of fact said anthony you know nothing at all about it
with me it's simply a matter of pride and for once gloria's reasonable enough to agree that we oughtn't go where we're not wanted
and people don't want us
we're too much the ideal bad examples
nonsense
you can't park your pessimism in my little sun parlor
i think you ought to forget all those morbid speculations and go to work
here i am thirtytwo
suppose i did start in at some idiotic business
perhaps in two years i might rise to fifty dollars a weekwith luck
that's if i could get a job at all there's an awful lot of unemployment
well suppose i made fifty a week
do you think i'd be any happier
do you think that if i don't get this money of my grandfather's life will be endurable  muriel smiled complacently
well she said that may be clever but it isn't common sense
a few minutes later gloria came in seeming to bring with her into the room some dark color indeterminate and rare
in a taciturn way she was happy to see muriel
she greeted anthony with a casual hi
i've been talking philosophy with your husband cried the irrepressible miss kane
we took up some fundamental concepts said anthony a faint smile disturbing his pale cheeks paler still under two days' growth of beard
oblivious to his irony muriel rehashed her contention
when she had done gloria said quietly  anthony's right
it's no fun to go around when you have the sense that people are looking at you in a certain way
he broke in plaintively  don't you think that when even maury noble who was my best friend won't come to see us it's high time to stop calling people up
tears were standing in his eyes
that was your fault about maury noble said gloria coolly
it wasn't
it most certainly was
muriel intervened quickly  i met a girl who knew maury the other day and she says he doesn't drink any more
he's getting pretty cagey
doesn't
practically not at all
he's making piles of money
he's sort of changed since the war
he's going to marry a girl in philadelphia who has millions ceci larrabeeanyhow that's what town tattle said
he's thirtythree said anthony thinking aloud
but it's odd to imagine his getting married
i used to think he was so brilliant
he was murmured gloria in a way
but brilliant people don't settle down in businessor do they
or what do they do
or what becomes of everybody you used to know and have so much in common with
you drift apart suggested muriel with the appropriate dreamy look
they change said gloria
all the qualities that they don't use in their daily lives get cobwebbed up
the last thing he said to me recollected anthony was that he was going to work so as to forget that there was nothing worth working for
muriel caught at this quickly
that's what you ought to do she exclaimed triumphantly
of course i shouldn't think anybody would want to work for nothing
but it'd give you something to do
what do you do with yourselves anyway
nobody ever sees you at montmartre oror anywhere
are you economizing
gloria laughed scornfully glancing at anthony from the corners of her eyes
well he demanded what are you laughing at
you know what i'm laughing at she answered coldly
at that case of whiskey
yesshe turned to murielhe paid seventyfive dollars for a case of whiskey yesterday
what if i did
it's cheaper that way than if you get it by the bottle
you needn't pretend that you won't drink any of it
at least i don't drink in the daytime
that's a fine distinction
he cried springing to his feet in a weak rage
what's more i'll be damned if you can hurl that at me every few minutes
it's true
it is not and i'm getting sick of this eternal business of criticising me before visitors
he had worked himself up to such a state that his arms and shoulders were visibly trembling
you'd think everything was my fault
you'd think you hadn't encouraged me to spend moneyand spent a lot more on yourself than i ever did by a long shot
now gloria rose to her feet
i won't let you talk to me that way
all right then by heaven you don't have to
in a sort of rush he left the room
the two women heard his steps in the hall and then the front door banged
gloria sank back into her chair
her face was lovely in the lamplight composed inscrutable
oh
cried muriel in distress
oh what is the matter
nothing particularly
he's just drunk
drunk
why he's perfectly sober
he talked  gloria shook her head
oh no he doesn't show it any more unless he can hardly stand up and he talks all right until he gets excited
he talks much better than he does when he's sober
but he's been sitting here all day drinkingexcept for the time it took him to walk to the corner for a newspaper
oh how terrible
muriel was sincerely moved
her eyes filled with tears
has this happened much
drinking you mean
no thisleaving you
oh yes
frequently
he'll come in about midnightand weep and ask me to forgive him
and do you
i don't know
we just go on
the two women sat there in the lamplight and looked at each other each in a different way helpless before this thing
gloria was still pretty as pretty as she would ever be againher cheeks were flushed and she was wearing a new dress that she had boughtimprudentlyfor fifty dollars
she had hoped she could persuade anthony to take her out tonight to a restaurant or even to one of the great gorgeous moving picture palaces where there would be a few people to look at her at whom she could bear to look in turn
she wanted this because she knew her cheeks were flushed and because her dress was new and becomingly fragile
only very occasionally now did they receive any invitations
but she did not tell these things to muriel
gloria dear i wish we could have dinner together but i promised a man and it's seventhirty already
i've got to tear
oh i couldn't anyway
in the first place i've been ill all day
i couldn't eat a thing
after she had walked with muriel to the door gloria came back into the room turned out the lamp and leaning her elbows on the window sill looked out at palisades park where the brilliant revolving circle of the ferris wheel was like a trembling mirror catching the yellow reflection of the moon
the street was quiet now the children had gone inover the way she could see a family at dinner
pointlessly ridiculously they rose and walked about the table seen thus all that they did appeared incongruousit was as though they were being jiggled carelessly and to no purpose by invisible overhead wires
she looked at her watchit was eight o'clock
she had been pleased for a part of the daythe early afternoonin walking along that broadway of harlem one hundred and twentyfifth street with her nostrils alert to many odors and her mind excited by the extraordinary beauty of some italian children
it affected her curiouslyas fifth avenue had affected her once in the days when with the placid confidence of beauty she had known that it was all hers every shop and all it held every adult toy glittering in a window all hers for the asking
here on one hundred and twentyfifth street there were salvation army bands and spectrumshawled old ladies on doorsteps and sugary sticky candy in the grimy hands of shinyhaired childrenand the late sun striking down on the sides of the tall tenements
all very rich and racy and savory like a dish by a provident french chef that one could not help enjoying even though one knew that the ingredients were probably leftovers  gloria shuddered suddenly as a river siren came moaning over the dusky roofs and leaning back in till the ghostly curtains fell from her shoulder she turned on the electric lamp
it was growing late
she knew there was some change in her purse and she considered whether she would go down and have some coffee and rolls where the liberated subway made a roaring cave of manhattan street or eat the devilled ham and bread in the kitchen
her purse decided for her
it contained a nickel and two pennies
after an hour the silence of the room had grown unbearable and she found that her eyes were wandering from her magazine to the ceiling toward which she stared without thought
suddenly she stood up hesitated for a moment biting at her fingerthen she went to the pantry took down a bottle of whiskey from the shelf and poured herself a drink
she filled up the glass with ginger ale and returning to her chair finished an article in the magazine
it concerned the last revolutionary widow who when a young girl had married an ancient veteran of the continental army and who had died in 
it seemed strange and oddly romantic to gloria that she and this woman had been contemporaries
she turned a page and learned that a candidate for congress was being accused of atheism by an opponent
gloria's surprise vanished when she found that the charges were false
the candidate had merely denied the miracle of the loaves and fishes
he admitted under pressure that he gave full credence to the stroll upon the water
finishing her first drink gloria got herself a second
after slipping on a neglige and making herself comfortable on the lounge she became conscious that she was miserable and that the tears were rolling down her cheeks
she wondered if they were tears of selfpity and tried resolutely not to cry but this existence without hope without happiness oppressed her and she kept shaking her head from side to side her mouth drawn down tremulously in the corners as though she were denying an assertion made by some one somewhere
she did not know that this gesture of hers was years older than history that for a hundred generations of men intolerable and persistent grief has offered that gesture of denial of protest of bewilderment to something more profound more powerful than the god made in the image of man and before which that god did he exist would be equally impotent
it is a truth set at the heart of tragedy that this force never explains never answersthis force intangible as air more definite than death
richard caramel  early in the summer anthony resigned from his last club the amsterdam
he had come to visit it hardly twice a year and the dues were a recurrent burden
he had joined it on his return from italy because it had been his grandfather's club and his father's and because it was a club that given the opportunity one indisputably joinedbut as a matter of fact he had preferred the harvard club largely because of dick and maury
however with the decline of his fortunes it had seemed an increasingly desirable bauble to cling to
it was relinquished at the last with some regret  his companions numbered now a curious dozen
several of them he had met in a place called sammy's on fortythird street where if one knocked on the door and were favorably passed on from behind a grating one could sit around a great round table drinking fairly good whiskey
it was here that he encountered a man named parker allison who had been exactly the wrong sort of rounder at harvard and who was running through a large yeast fortune as rapidly as possible
parker allison's notion of distinction consisted in driving a noisy redandyellow racingcar up broadway with two glittering hardeyed girls beside him
he was the sort who dined with two girls rather than with onehis imagination was almost incapable of sustaining a dialogue
besides allison there was pete lytell who wore a gray derby on the side of his head
he always had money and he was customarily cheerful so anthony held aimless longwinded conversation with him through many afternoons of the summer and fall
lytell he found not only talked but reasoned in phrases
his philosophy was a series of them assimilated here and there through an active thoughtless life
he had phrases about socialismthe immemorial ones he had phrases pertaining to the existence of a personal deitysomething about one time when he had been in a railroad accident and he had phrases about the irish problem the sort of woman he respected and the futility of prohibition
the only time his conversation ever rose superior to these muddled clauses with which he interpreted the most rococo happenings in a life that had been more than usually eventful was when he got down to the detailed discussion of his most animal existence he knew to a subtlety the foods the liquor and the women that he preferred
he was at once the commonest and the most remarkable product of civilization
he was nine out of ten people that one passes on a city streetand he was a hairless ape with two dozen tricks
he was the hero of a thousand romances of life and artand he was a virtual moron performing staidly yet absurdly a series of complicated and infinitely astounding epics over a span of threescore years
with such men as these two anthony patch drank and discussed and drank and argued
he liked them because they knew nothing about him because they lived in the obvious and had not the faintest conception of the inevitable continuity of life
they sat not before a motion picture with consecutive reels but at a musty oldfashioned travelogue with all values stark and hence all implications confused
yet they themselves were not confused because there was nothing in them to be confusedthey changed phrases from month to month as they changed neckties
anthony the courteous the subtle the perspicacious was drunk each dayin sammy's with these men in the apartment over a book some book he knew and very rarely with gloria who in his eyes had begun to develop the unmistakable outlines of a quarrelsome and unreasonable woman
she was not the gloria of old certainlythe gloria who had she been sick would have preferred to inflict misery upon every one around her rather than confess that she needed sympathy or assistance
she was not above whining now she was not above being sorry for herself
each night when she prepared for bed she smeared her face with some new unguent which she hoped illogically would give back the glow and freshness to her vanishing beauty
when anthony was drunk he taunted her about this
when he was sober he was polite to her on occasions even tender he seemed to show for short hours a trace of that old quality of understanding too well to blamethat quality which was the best of him and had worked swiftly and ceaselessly toward his ruin
but he hated to be sober
it made him conscious of the people around him of that air of struggle of greedy ambition of hope more sordid than despair of incessant passage up or down which in every metropolis is most in evidence through the unstable middle class
unable to live with the rich he thought that his next choice would have been to live with the very poor
anything was better than this cup of perspiration and tears
the sense of the enormous panorama of life never strong in anthony had become dim almost to extinction
at long intervals now some incident some gesture of gloria's would take his fancybut the gray veils had come down in earnest upon him
as he grew older those things fadedafter that there was wine
there was a kindliness about intoxicationthere was that indescribable gloss and glamour it gave like the memories of ephemeral and faded evenings
after a few highballs there was magic in the tall glowing arabian night of the bush terminal buildingits summit a peak of sheer grandeur gold and dreaming against the inaccessible sky
and wall street the crass the banalagain it was the triumph of gold a gorgeous sentient spectacle it was where the great kings kept the money for their wars  
the fruit of youth or of the grape the transitory magic of the brief passage from darkness to darknessthe old illusion that truth and beauty were in some way entwined
as he stood in front of delmonico's lighting a cigarette one night he saw two hansoms drawn up close to the curb waiting for a chance drunken fare
the outmoded cabs were worn and dirtythe cracked patent leather wrinkled like an old man's face the cushions faded to a brownish lavender the very horses were ancient and weary and so were the whitehaired men who sat aloft cracking their whips with a grotesque affectation of gallantry
a relic of vanished gaiety
anthony patch walked away in a sudden fit of depression pondering the bitterness of such survivals
there was nothing it seemed that grew stale so soon as pleasure
on fortysecond street one afternoon he met richard caramel for the first time in many months a prosperous fattening richard caramel whose face was filling out to match the bostonian brow
just got in this week from the coast
was going to call you up but i didn't know your new address
we've moved
richard caramel noticed that anthony was wearing a soiled shirt that his cuffs were slightly but perceptibly frayed that his eyes were set in halfmoons the color of cigar smoke
so i gathered he said fixing his friend with his brightyellow eye
but where and how is gloria
my god anthony i've been hearing the doggonedest stories about you two even out in californiaand when i get back to new york i find you've sunk absolutely out of sight
why don't you pull yourself together
now listen chattered anthony unsteadily i can't stand a long lecture
we've lost money in a dozen ways and naturally people have talkedon account of the lawsuit but the thing's coming to a final decision this winter surely  you're talking so fast that i can't understand you interrupted dick calmly
well i've said all i'm going to say snapped anthony
come and see us if you likeor don't
with this he turned and started to walk off in the crowd but dick overtook him immediately and grasped his arm
say anthony don't fly off the handle so easily
you know gloria's my cousin and you're one of my oldest friends so it's natural for me to be interested when i hear that you're going to the dogsand taking her with you
i don't want to be preached to
well then all righthow about coming up to my apartment and having a drink
i've just got settled
i've bought three cases of gordon gin from a revenue officer
as they walked along he continued in a burst of exasperation  and how about your grandfather's moneyyou going to get it
well answered anthony resentfully that old fool haight seems hopeful especially because people are tired of reformers right nowyou know it might make a slight difference for instance if some judge thought that adam patch made it harder for him to get liquor
you can't do without money said dick sententiously
have you tried to write anylately
anthony shook his head silently
that's funny said dick
i always thought that you and maury would write some day and now he's grown to be a sort of tightfisted aristocrat and you're  i'm the bad example
i wonder why
you probably think you know suggested anthony with an effort at concentration
the failure and the success both believe in their hearts that they have accurately balanced points of view the success because he's succeeded and the failure because he's failed
the successful man tells his son to profit by his father's good fortune and the failure tells his son to profit by his father's mistakes
i don't agree with you said the author of a shavetail in france
i used to listen to you and maury when we were young and i used to be impressed because you were so consistently cynical but nowwell after all by god which of us three has taken to theto the intellectual life
i don't want to sound vainglorious butit's me and i've always believed that moral values existed and i always will
well objected anthony who was rather enjoying himself even granting that you know that in practice life never presents problems as clear cut does it
it does to me
there's nothing i'd violate certain principles for
but how do you know when you're violating them
you have to guess at things just like most people do
you have to apportion the values when you look back
you finish up the portrait thenpaint in the details and shadows
dick shook his head with a lofty stubbornness
same old futile cynic he said
it's just a mode of being sorry for yourself
you don't do anythingso nothing matters
oh i'm quite capable of selfpity admitted anthony nor am i claiming that i'm getting as much fun out of life as you are
you sayat least you used tothat happiness is the only thing worth while in life
do you think you're any happier for being a pessimist
anthony grunted savagely
his pleasure in the conversation began to wane
he was nervous and craving for a drink
my golly
he cried where do you live
i can't keep walking forever
your endurance is all mental eh
returned dick sharply
well i live right here
he turned in at the apartment house on fortyninth street and a few minutes later they were in a large new room with an open fireplace and four walls lined with books
a colored butler served them gin rickeys and an hour vanished politely with the mellow shortening of their drinks and the glow of a light midautumn fire
the arts are very old said anthony after a while
with a few glasses the tension of his nerves relaxed and he found that he could think again
which art
all of them
poetry is dying first
it'll be absorbed into prose sooner or later
for instance the beautiful word the colored and glittering word and the beautiful simile belong in prose now
to get attention poetry has got to strain for the unusual word the harsh earthy word that's never been beautiful before
beauty as the sum of several beautiful parts reached its apotheosis in swinburne
it can't go any furtherexcept in the novel perhaps
dick interrupted him impatiently  you know these new novels make me tired
my god
everywhere i go some silly girl asks me if i've read 'this side of paradise'
are our girls really like that
if it's true to life which i don't believe the next generation is going to the dogs
i'm sick of all this shoddy realism
i think there's a place for the romanticist in literature
anthony tried to remember what he had read lately of richard caramel's
there was a shavetail in france a novel called the land of strong men and several dozen short stories which were even worse
it had become the custom among young and clever reviewers to mention richard caramel with a smile of scorn
mr richard caramel they called him
his corpse was dragged obscenely through every literary supplement
he was accused of making a great fortune by writing trash for the movies
as the fashion in books shifted he was becoming almost a byword of contempt
while anthony was thinking this dick had got to his feet and seemed to be hesitating at an avowal
i've gathered quite a few books he said suddenly
so i see
i've made an exhaustive collection of good american stuff old and new
i don't mean the usual longfellowwhittier thingin fact most of it's modern
he stepped to one of the walls and seeing that it was expected of him anthony arose and followed
look
under a printed tag americana he displayed six long rows of books beautifully bound and obviously carefully chosen
and here are the contemporary novelists
then anthony saw the joker
wedged in between mark twain and dreiser were eight strange and inappropriate volumes the works of richard caramelthe demon lover true enough  but also seven others that were execrably awful without sincerity or grace
unwillingly anthony glanced at dick's face and caught a slight uncertainty there
i've put my own books in of course said richard caramel hastily though one or two of them are uneveni'm afraid i wrote a little too fast when i had that magazine contract
but i don't believe in false modesty
of course some of the critics haven't paid so much attention to me since i've been establishedbut after all it's not the critics that count
they're just sheep
for the first time in so long that he could scarcely remember anthony felt a touch of the old pleasant contempt for his friend
richard caramel continued  my publishers you know have been advertising me as the thackeray of americabecause of my new york novel
yes anthony managed to muster i suppose there's a good deal in what you say
he knew that his contempt was unreasonable
he knew that he would have changed places with dick unhesitatingly
he himself had tried his best to write with his tongue in his cheek
ah well thencan a man disparage his lifework so readily
  and that night while richard caramel was hard at toil with great hittings of the wrong keys and screwings up of his weary unmatched eyes laboring over his trash far into those cheerless hours when the fire dies down and the head is swimming from the effect of prolonged concentrationanthony abominably drunk was sprawled across the back seat of a taxi on his way to the flat on claremont avenue
the beating  as winter approached it seemed that a sort of madness seized upon anthony
he awoke in the morning so nervous that gloria could feel him trembling in the bed before he could muster enough vitality to stumble into the pantry for a drink
he was intolerable now except under the influence of liquor and as he seemed to decay and coarsen under her eyes gloria's soul and body shrank away from him when he stayed out all night as he did several times she not only failed to be sorry but even felt a measure of relief
next day he would be faintly repentant and would remark in a gruff hangdog fashion that he guessed he was drinking a little too much
for hours at a time he would sit in the great armchair that had been in his apartment lost in a sort of stuporeven his interest in reading his favorite books seemed to have departed and though an incessant bickering went on between husband and wife the one subject upon which they ever really conversed was the progress of the will case
what gloria hoped in the tenebrous depths of her soul what she expected that great gift of money to bring about is difficult to imagine
she was being bent by her environment into a grotesque similitude of a housewife
she who until three years before had never made coffee prepared sometimes three meals a day
she walked a great deal in the afternoons and in the evenings she readbooks magazines anything she found at hand
if now she wished for a child even a child of the anthony who sought her bed blind drunk she neither said so nor gave any show or sign of interest in children
it is doubtful if she could have made it clear to any one what it was she wanted or indeed what there was to wanta lonely lovely woman thirty now retrenched behind some impregnable inhibition born and coexistent with her beauty
one afternoon when the snow was dirty again along riverside drive gloria who had been to the grocer's entered the apartment to find anthony pacing the floor in a state of aggravated nervousness
the feverish eyes he turned on her were traced with tiny pink lines that reminded her of rivers on a map
for a moment she received the impression that he was suddenly and definitely old
have you any money
he inquired of her precipitately
what
what do you mean
just what i said
money
money
can't you speak english
she paid no attention but brushed by him and into the pantry to put the bacon and eggs in the icebox
when his drinking had been unusually excessive he was invariably in a whining mood
this time he followed her and standing in the pantry door persisted in his question
you heard what i said
have you any money
she turned about from the icebox and faced him
why anthony you must be crazy
you know i haven't any moneyexcept a dollar in change
he executed an abrupt aboutface and returned to the living room where he renewed his pacing
it was evident that he had something portentous on his mindhe quite obviously wanted to be asked what was the matter
joining him a moment later she sat upon the long lounge and began taking down her hair
it was no longer bobbed and it had changed in the last year from a rich gold dusted with red to an unresplendent light brown
she had bought some shampoo soap and meant to wash it now she had considered putting a bottle of peroxide into the rinsing water  
well
she implied silently
that darn bank
he quavered
they've had my account for over ten yearsten years
well it seems they've got some autocratic rule that you have to keep over five hundred dollars there or they won't carry you
they wrote me a letter a few months ago and told me i'd been running too low
once i gave out two bum checksremember
that night in reisenweber'sbut i made them good the very next day
well i promised old halloranhe's the manager the greedy mickthat i'd watch out
and i thought i was going all right i kept up the stubs in my checkbook pretty regular
well i went in there today to cash a check and halloran came up and told me they'd have to close my account
too many bad checks he said and i never had more than five hundred to my creditand that only for a day or so at a time
and by god
what do you think he said then
what
he said this was a good time to do it because i didn't have a damn penny in there
you didn't
that's what he told me
seems i'd given these bedros people a check for sixty for that last case of liquorand i only had fortyfive dollars in the bank
well the bedros people deposited fifteen dollars to my account and drew the whole thing out
in her ignorance gloria conjured up a spectre of imprisonment and disgrace
oh they won't do anything he assured her
bootlegging's too risky a business
they'll send me a bill for fifteen dollars and i'll pay it
oh
she considered a moment 
well we can sell another bond
he laughed sarcastically
oh yes that's always easy
when the few bonds we have that are paying any interest at all are only worth between fifty and eighty cents on the dollar
we lose about half the bond every time we sell
what else can we do
oh we'll sell somethingas usual
we've got paper worth eighty thousand dollars at par
again he laughed unpleasantly
bring about thirty thousand on the open market
i distrusted those ten per cent investments
the deuce you did
he said
you pretended you did so you could claw at me if they went to pieces but you wanted to take a chance as much as i did
she was silent for a moment as if considering then  anthony she cried suddenly two hundred a month is worse than nothing
let's sell all the bonds and put the thirty thousand dollars in the bankand if we lose the case we can live in italy for three years and then just die
in her excitement as she talked she was aware of a faint flush of sentiment the first she had felt in many days
three years he said nervously three years
you're crazy
mr haight'll take more than that if we lose
do you think he's working for charity
i forgot that
and here it is saturday he continued and i've only got a dollar and some change and we've got to live till monday when i can get to my broker's and not a drink in the house he added as a significant afterthought
can't you call up dick
i did
his man says he's gone down to princeton to address a literary club or some such thing
won't be back till monday
well let's seedon't you know some friend you might go to
i tried a couple of fellows
couldn't find anybody in
i wish i'd sold that keats letter like i started to last week
how about those men you play cards with in that sammy place
do you think i'd ask them his voice rang with righteous horror
gloria winced
he would rather contemplate her active discomfort than feel his own skin crawl at asking an inappropriate favor
i thought of muriel he suggested
she's in california
well how about some of those men who gave you such a good time while i was in the army
you'd think they might be glad to do a little favor for you
she looked at him contemptuously but he took no notice
or how about your old friend rachaelor constance merriam
constance merriam's been dead a year and i wouldn't ask rachael
well how about that gentleman who was so anxious to help you once that he could hardly restrain himself bloeckman
oh
he had hurt her at last and he was not too obtuse or too careless to perceive it
why not him
he insisted callously
becausehe doesn't like me any more she said with difficulty and then as he did not answer but only regarded her cynically if you want to know why i'll tell you
a year ago i went to bloeckmanhe's changed his name to blackand asked him to put me into pictures
you went to bloeckman
yes
why didn't you tell me
he demanded incredulously the smile fading from his face
because you were probably off drinking somewhere
he had them give me a test and they decided that i wasn't young enough for anything except a character part
a character part
the 'woman of thirty' sort of thing
i wasn't thirty and i didn't think ilooked thirty
why damn him
cried anthony championing her violently with a curious perverseness of emotion why  well that's why i can't go to him
why the insolence
insisted anthony nervously the insolence
anthony that doesn't matter now the thing is we've got to live over sunday and there's nothing in the house but a loaf of bread and a halfpound of bacon and two eggs for breakfast
she handed him the contents of her purse
there's seventy eighty a dollar fifteen
with what you have that makes about two and a half altogether doesn't it
anthony we can get along on that
we can buy lots of food with thatmore than we can possibly eat
jingling the change in his hand he shook his head
no
i've got to have a drink
i'm so darn nervous that i'm shivering
a thought struck him
perhaps sammy'd cash a check
and then monday i could rush down to the bank with the money
but they've closed your account
that's right that's righti'd forgotten
i'll tell you what i'll go down to sammy's and i'll find somebody there who'll lend me something
i hate like the devil to ask them though he snapped his fingers suddenly
i know what i'll do
i'll hock my watch
i can get twenty dollars on it and get it back monday for sixty cents extra
it's been hocked beforewhen i was at cambridge
he had put on his overcoat and with a brief goodby he started down the hall toward the outer door
gloria got to her feet
it had suddenly occurred to her where he would probably go first
anthony
she called after him hadn't you better leave two dollars with me
you'll only need carfare
the outer door slammedhe had pretended not to hear her
she stood for a moment looking after him then she went into the bathroom among her tragic unguents and began preparations for washing her hair
down at sammy's he found parker allison and pete lytell sitting alone at a table drinking whiskey sours
it was just after six o'clock and sammy or samuele bendiri as he had been christened was sweeping an accumulation of cigarette butts and broken glass into a corner
hi tony
called parker allison to anthony
sometimes he addressed him as tony at other times it was dan
to him all anthonys must sail under one of these diminutives
sit down
what'll you have
on the subway anthony had counted his money and found that he had almost four dollars
he could pay for two rounds at fifty cents a drinkwhich meant that he would have six drinks
then he would go over to sixth avenue and get twenty dollars and a pawn ticket in exchange for his watch
well roughnecks he said jovially how's the life of crime
pretty good said allison
he winked at pete lytell
too bad you're a married man
we've got some pretty good stuff lined up for about eleven o'clock when the shows let out
oh boy
yes sirtoo bad he's marriedisn't it pete
'sa shame
at half past seven when they had completed the six rounds anthony found that his intentions were giving audience to his desires
he was happy and cheerful nowthoroughly enjoying himself
it seemed to him that the story which pete had just finished telling was unusually and profoundly humorousand he decided as he did every day at about this point that they were damn good fellows by golly
who would do a lot more for him than any one else he knew
the pawnshops would remain open until late saturday nights and he felt that if he took just one more drink he would attain a gorgeous rosecolored exhilaration
artfully he fished in his vest pockets brought up his two quarters and stared at them as though in surprise
well i'll be darned he protested in an aggrieved tone here i've come out without my pocketbook
need some cash
asked lytell easily
i left my money on the dresser at home
and i wanted to buy you another drink
ohknock it
lytell waved the suggestion away disparagingly
i guess we can blow a good fella to all the drinks he wants
what'll you havesame
i tell you suggested parker allison suppose we send sammy across the street for some sandwiches and eat dinner here
the other two agreed
good idea
hey sammy wantcha do somep'm for us  just after nine o'clock anthony staggered to his feet and bidding them a thick good night walked unsteadily to the door handing sammy one of his two quarters as he passed out
once in the street he hesitated uncertainly and then started in the direction of sixth avenue where he remembered to have frequently passed several loan offices
he went by a newsstand and two drugstoresand then he realized that he was standing in front of the place which he sought and that it was shut and barred
unperturbed he continued another one half a block down was also closedso were two more across the street and a fifth in the square below
seeing a faint light in the last one he began to knock on the glass door he desisted only when a watchman appeared in the back of the shop and motioned him angrily to move on
with growing discouragement with growing befuddlement he crossed the street and walked back toward fortythird
on the corner near sammy's he paused undecidedif he went back to the apartment as he felt his body required he would lay himself open to bitter reproach yet now that the pawnshops were closed he had no notion where to get the money
he decided finally that he might ask parker allison after allbut he approached sammy's only to find the door locked and the lights out
he looked at his watch ninethirty
he began walking
ten minutes later he stopped aimlessly at the corner of fortythird street and madison avenue diagonally across from the bright but nearly deserted entrance to the biltmore hotel
here he stood for a moment and then sat down heavily on a damp board amid some debris of construction work
he rested there for almost half an hour his mind a shifting pattern of surface thoughts chiefest among which were that he must obtain some money and get home before he became too sodden to find his way
then glancing over toward the biltmore he saw a man standing directly under the overhead glow of the portecochre lamps beside a woman in an ermine coat
as anthony watched the couple moved forward and signalled to a taxi
anthony perceived by the infallible identification that lurks in the walk of a friend that it was maury noble
he rose to his feet
maury
he shouted
maury looked in his direction then turned back to the girl just as the taxi came up into place
with the chaotic idea of borrowing ten dollars anthony began to run as fast as he could across madison avenue and along fortythird street
as he came up maury was standing beside the yawning door of the taxicab
his companion turned and looked curiously at anthony
hello maury
he said holding out his hand
how are you
fine thank you
their hands dropped and anthony hesitated
maury made no move to introduce him but only stood there regarding him with an inscrutable feline silence
i wanted to see you began anthony uncertainly
he did not feel that he could ask for a loan with the girl not four feet away so he broke off and made a perceptible motion of his head as if to beckon maury to one side
i'm in rather a big hurry anthony
i knowbut can you can you again he hesitated
i'll see you some other time said maury
it's important
i'm sorry anthony
before anthony could make up his mind to blurt out his request maury had turned coolly to the girl helped her into the car and with a polite good evening stepped in after her
as he nodded from the window it seemed to anthony that his expression had not changed by a shade or a hair
then with a fretful clatter the taxi moved off and anthony was left standing there alone under the lights
anthony went on into the biltmore for no reason in particular except that the entrance was at hand and ascending the wide stair found a seat in an alcove
he was furiously aware that he had been snubbed he was as hurt and angry as it was possible for him to be when in that condition
nevertheless he was stubbornly preoccupied with the necessity of obtaining some money before he went home and once again he told over on his fingers the acquaintances he might conceivably call on in this emergency
he thought eventually that he might approach mr howland his broker at his home
after a long wait he found that mr howland was out
he returned to the operator leaning over her desk and fingering his quarter as though loath to leave unsatisfied
call mr bloeckman he said suddenly
his own words surprised him
the name had come from some crossing of two suggestions in his mind
what's the number please
scarcely conscious of what he did anthony looked up joseph bloeckman in the telephone directory
he could find no such person and was about to close the book when it flashed into his mind that gloria had mentioned a change of name
it was the matter of a minute to find joseph blackthen he waited in the booth while central called the number
helloo
mr bloeckmani mean mr black in
no he's out this evening
is there any message
the intonation was cockney it reminded him of the rich vocal deferences of bounds
where is he
why ah who is this please sir
this mr patch
matter of vi'al importance
why he's with a party at the boul' mich' sir
thanks
anthony got his five cents change and started for the boul' mich' a popular dancing resort on fortyfifth street
it was nearly ten but the streets were dark and sparsely peopled until the theatres should eject their spawn an hour later
anthony knew the boul' mich' for he had been there with gloria during the year before and he remembered the existence of a rule that patrons must be in evening dress
well he would not go upstairshe would send a boy up for bloeckman and wait for him in the lower hall
for a moment he did not doubt that the whole project was entirely natural and graceful
to his distorted imagination bloeckman had become simply one of his old friends
the entrance hall of the boul' mich' was warm
there were high yellow lights over a thick green carpet from the centre of which a white stairway rose to the dancing floor
anthony spoke to the hallboy  i want to see mr bloeckmanmr black he said
he's upstairshave him paged
the boy shook his head
'sagainsa rules to have him paged
you know what table he's at
no
but i've got see him
wait an' i'll getcha waiter
after a short interval a head waiter appeared bearing a card on which were charted the table reservations
he darted a cynical look at anthonywhich however failed of its target
together they bent over the cardboard and found the table without difficultya party of eight mr black's own
tell him mr patch
very very important
again he waited leaning against the banister and listening to the confused harmonies of jazzmad which came floating down the stairs
a checkgirl near him was singing  out inthe shimmee sanitarium the jazzmad nuts reside
out inthe shimmee sanitarium i left my blushing bride
she went and shook herself insane so let her shiver back again  then he saw bloeckman descending the staircase and took a step forward to meet him and shake hands
you wanted to see me
said the older man coolly
yes answered anthony nodding personal matter
can you jus' step over here
regarding him narrowly bloeckman followed anthony to a half bend made by the staircase where they were beyond observation or earshot of any one entering or leaving the restaurant
well
he inquired
wanted talk to you
what about
anthony only laugheda silly laugh he intended it to sound casual
what do you want to talk to me about
repeated bloeckman
wha's hurry old man
he tried to lay his hand in a friendly gesture upon bloeckman's shoulder but the latter drew away slightly
how've been
very well thanks see here mr patch i've got a party upstairs
they'll think it's rude if i stay away too long
what was it you wanted to see me about
for the second time that evening anthony's mind made an abrupt jump and what he said was not at all what he had intended to say
un'erstand you kep' my wife out of the movies
what
bloeckman's ruddy face darkened in parallel planes of shadows
you heard me
look here mr patch said bloeckman evenly and without changing his expression you're drunk
you're disgustingly and insultingly drunk
not too drunk talk to you insisted anthony with a leer
firs' place my wife wants nothin' whatever do with you
never did
un'erstand me
be quiet
said the older man angrily
i should think you'd respect your wife enough not to bring her into the conversation under these circumstances
never you min' how i expect my wife
one thingyou leave her alone
you go to hell
see herei think you're a little crazy
exclaimed bloeckman
he took two paces forward as though to pass by but anthony stepped in his way
not so fas' you goddam jew
for a moment they stood regarding each other anthony swaying gently from side to side bloeckman almost trembling with fury
be careful
he cried in a strained voice
anthony might have remembered then a certain look bloeckman had given him in the biltmore hotel years before
but he remembered nothing nothing  i'll say it again you god  then bloeckman struck out with all the strength in the arm of a wellconditioned man of fortyfive struck out and caught anthony squarely in the mouth
anthony cracked up against the staircase recovered himself and made a wild drunken swing at his opponent but bloeckman who took exercise every day and knew something of sparring blocked it with ease and struck him twice in the face with two swift smashing jabs
anthony gave a little grunt and toppled over onto the green plush carpet finding as he fell that his mouth was full of blood and seemed oddly loose in front
he struggled to his feet panting and spitting and then as he started toward bloeckman who stood a few feet away his fists clenched but not up two waiters who had appeared from nowhere seized his arms and held him helpless
in back of them a dozen people had miraculously gathered
i'll kill him cried anthony pitching and straining from side to side
let me kill  throw him out
ordered bloeckman excitedly just as a small man with a pockmarked face pushed his way hurriedly through the spectators
any trouble mr
black
this bum tried to blackmail me
said bloeckman and then his voice rising to a faintly shrill note of pride he got what was coming to him
the little man turned to a waiter
call a policeman
he commanded
oh no said bloeckman quickly
i can't be bothered
just throw him out in the street ugh
what an outrage
he turned and with conscious dignity walked toward the washroom just as six brawny hands seized upon anthony and dragged him toward the door
the bum was propelled violently to the sidewalk where he landed on his hands and knees with a grotesque slapping sound and rolled over slowly onto his side
the shock stunned him
he lay there for a moment in acute distributed pain
then his discomfort became centralized in his stomach and he regained consciousness to discover that a large foot was prodding him
you've got to move on y' bum
move on
it was the bulky doorman speaking
a town car had stopped at the curb and its occupants had disembarkedthat is two of the women were standing on the dashboard waiting in offended delicacy until this obscene obstacle should be removed from their path
move on
or else i'll throw y'on
herei'll get him
this was a new voice anthony imagined that it was somehow more tolerant better disposed than the first
again arms were about him half lifting half dragging him into a welcome shadow four doors up the street and propping him against the stone front of a millinery shop
much obliged muttered anthony feebly
some one pushed his soft hat down upon his head and he winced
just sit still buddy and you'll feel better
those guys sure give you a bump
i'm going back and kill that dirty he tried to get to his feet but collapsed backward against the wall
you can't do nothin' now came the voice
get 'em some other time
i'm tellin' you straight ain't i
i'm helpin' you
anthony nodded
an' you better go home
you dropped a tooth tonight buddy
you know that
anthony explored his mouth with his tongue verifying the statement
then with an effort he raised his hand and located the gap
i'm agoin' to get you home friend
whereabouts do you live  oh by god
by god
interrupted anthony clenching his fists passionately
i'll show the dirty bunch
you help me show 'em and i'll fix it with you
my grandfather's adam patch of tarrytown  who
adam patch by god
you wanna go all the way to tarrytown
no
well you tell me where to go friend and i'll get a cab
anthony made out that his samaritan was a short broadshouldered individual somewhat the worse for wear
where d'you live hey
sodden and shaken as he was anthony felt that his address would be poor collateral for his wild boast about his grandfather
get me a cab he commanded feeling in his pockets
a taxi drove up
again anthony essayed to rise but his ankle swung loose as though it were in two sections
the samaritan must needs help him inand climb in after him
see here fella said he you're soused and you're bunged up and you won't be able to get in your house 'less somebody carries you in so i'm going with you and i know you'll make it all right with me
where d'you live
with some reluctance anthony gave his address
then as the cab moved off he leaned his head against the man's shoulder and went into a shadowy painful torpor
when he awoke the man had lifted him from the cab in front of the apartment on claremont avenue and was trying to set him on his feet
can y' walk
yessort of
you better not come in with me
again he felt helplessly in his pockets
say he continued apologetically swaying dangerously on his feet i'm afraid i haven't got a cent
huh
i'm cleaned out
saaay
didn't i hear you promise you'd fix it with me
who's goin' to pay the taxi bill
he turned to the driver for confirmation
didn't you hear him say he'd fix it
all that about his grandfather
matter of fact muttered anthony imprudently it was you did all the talking however if you come round tomorrow  at this point the taxidriver leaned from his cab and said ferociously  ah poke him one the dirty cheap skate
if he wasn't a bum they wouldn'ta throwed him out
in answer to this suggestion the fist of the samaritan shot out like a batteringram and sent anthony crashing down against the stone steps of the apartmenthouse where he lay without movement while the tall buildings rocked to and fro above him  after a long while he awoke and was conscious that it had grown much colder
he tried to move himself but his muscles refused to function
he was curiously anxious to know the time but he reached for his watch only to find the pocket empty
involuntarily his lips formed an immemorial phrase  what a night
strangely enough he was almost sober
without moving his head he looked up to where the moon was anchored in midsky shedding light down into claremont avenue as into the bottom of a deep and uncharted abyss
there was no sign or sound of life save for the continuous buzzing in his own ears but after a moment anthony himself broke the silence with a distinct and peculiar murmur
it was the sound that he had consistently attempted to make back there in the boul' mich' when he had been face to face with bloeckmanthe unmistakable sound of ironic laughter
and on his torn and bleeding lips it was like a pitiful retching of the soul
three weeks later the trial came to an end
the seemingly endless spool of legal red tape having unrolled over a period of four and a half years suddenly snapped off
anthony and gloria and on the other side edward shuttleworth and a platoon of beneficiaries testified and lied and illbehaved generally in varying degrees of greed and desperation
anthony awoke one morning in march realizing that the verdict was to be given at four that afternoon and at the thought he got up out of his bed and began to dress
with his extreme nervousness there was mingled an unjustified optimism as to the outcome
he believed that the decision of the lower court would be reversed if only because of the reaction due to excessive prohibition that had recently set in against reforms and reformers
he counted more on the personal attacks that they had levelled at shuttleworth than on the more sheerly legal aspects of the proceedings
dressed he poured himself a drink of whiskey and then went into gloria's room where he found her already wide awake
she had been in bed for a week humoring herself anthony fancied though the doctor had said that she had best not be disturbed
good morning she murmured without smiling
her eyes seemed unusually large and dark
how do you feel
he asked grudgingly
better
yes
much
yes
do you feel well enough to go down to court with me this afternoon
she nodded
yes
i want to
dick said yesterday that if the weather was nice he was coming up in his car and take me for a ride in central parkand look the room's all full of sunshine
anthony glanced mechanically out the window and then sat down upon the bed
god i'm nervous
he exclaimed
please don't sit there she said quickly
why not
you smell of whiskey
i can't stand it
he got up absentmindedly and left the room
a little later she called to him and he went out and brought her some potato salad and cold chicken from the delicatessen
at two o'clock richard caramel's car arrived at the door and when he phoned up anthony took gloria down in the elevator and walked with her to the curb
she told her cousin that it was sweet of him to take her riding
don't be simple dick replied disparagingly
it's nothing
but he did not mean that it was nothing and this was a curious thing
richard caramel had forgiven many people for many offenses
but he had never forgiven his cousin gloria gilbert for a statement she had made just prior to her wedding seven years before
she had said that she did not intend to read his book
richard caramel remembered thishe had remembered it well for seven years
what time will i expect you back
asked anthony
we won't come back she answered we'll meet you down there at four
all right he muttered i'll meet you
upstairs he found a letter waiting for him
it was a mimeographed notice urging the boys in condescendingly colloquial language to pay the dues of the american legion
he threw it impatiently into the wastebasket and sat down with his elbows on the window sill looking down blindly into the sunny street
italyif the verdict was in their favor it meant italy
the word had become a sort of talisman to him a land where the intolerable anxieties of life would fall away like an old garment
they would go to the wateringplaces first and among the bright and colorful crowds forget the gray appendages of despair
marvellously renewed he would walk again in the piazza di spanga at twilight moving in that drifting flotsam of dark women and ragged beggars of austere barefooted friars
the thought of italian women stirred him faintlywhen his purse hung heavy again even romance might fly back to perch upon itthe romance of blue canals in venice of the golden green hills of fiesole after rain and of women women who changed dissolved melted into other women and receded from his life but who were always beautiful and always young
but it seemed to him that there should be a difference in his attitude
all the distress that he had ever known the sorrow and the pain had been because of women
it was something that in different ways they did to him unconsciously almost casuallyperhaps finding him tenderminded and afraid they killed the things in him that menaced their absolute sway
turning about from the window he faced his reflection in the mirror contemplating dejectedly the wan pasty face the eyes with their crisscross of lines like shreds of dried blood the stooped and flabby figure whose very sag was a document in lethargy
he was thirty threehe looked forty
well things would be different
the doorbell rang abruptly and he started as though he had been dealt a blow
recovering himself he went into the hall and opened the outer door
it was dot
the encounter  he retreated before her into the living room comprehending only a word here and there in the slow flood of sentences that poured from her steadily one after the other in a persistent monotone
she was decently and shabbily dresseda somehow pitiable little hat adorned with pink and blue flowers covered and hid her dark hair
he gathered from her words that several days before she had seen an item in the paper concerning the lawsuit and had obtained his address from the clerk of the appellate division
she had called up the apartment and had been told that anthony was out by a woman to whom she had refused to give her name
in a living room he stood by the door regarding her with a sort of stupefied horror as she rattled on his predominant sensation was that all the civilization and convention around him was curiously unreal she was in a milliner's shop on sixth avenue she said
it was a lonesome life
she had been sick for a long while after he left for camp mills her mother had come down and taken her home again to carolina she had come to new york with the idea of finding anthony
she was appallingly in earnest
her violet eyes were red with tears her soft intonation was ragged with little gasping sobs
that was all
she had never changed
she wanted him now and if she couldn't have him she must die  you'll have to get out he said at length speaking with tortuous intensity
haven't i enough to worry me now without you coming here
my god
you'll have to get out
  sobbing she sat down in a chair
i love you she cried i don't care what you say to me
i love you
i don't care
he almost shrieked get outoh get out
haven't you done me harm enough
haven'tyoudoneenough
hit me
she implored himwildly stupidly
oh hit me and i'll kiss the hand you hit me with
his voice rose until it was pitched almost at a scream
i'll kill you
he cried
if you don't get out i'll kill you i'll kill you
there was madness in his eyes now but unintimidated dot rose and took a step toward him
anthony
anthony  he made a little clicking sound with his teeth and drew back as though to spring at herthen changing his purpose he looked wildly about him on the floor and wall
i'll kill you
he was muttering in short broken gasps
i'll kill you
he seemed to bite at the word as though to force it into materialization
alarmed at last she made no further movement forward but meeting his frantic eyes took a step back toward the door
anthony began to race here and there on his side of the room still giving out his single cursing cry
then he found what he had been seekinga stiff oaken chair that stood beside the table
uttering a harsh broken shout he seized it swung it above his head and let it go with all his raging strength straight at the white frightened face across the room  then a thick impenetrable darkness came down upon him and blotted out thought rage and madness togetherwith almost a tangible snapping sound the face of the world changed before his eyes  gloria and dick came in at five and called his name
there was no answerthey went into the living room and found a chair with its back smashed lying in the doorway and they noticed that all about the room there was a sort of disorderthe rugs had slid the pictures and bricbrac were upset upon the centre table
the air was sickly sweet with cheap perfume
they found anthony sitting in a patch of sunshine on the floor of his bedroom
before him open were spread his three big stampbooks and when they entered he was running his hands through a great pile of stamps that he had dumped from the back of one of them
looking up and seeing dick and gloria he put his head critically on one side and motioned them back
anthony
cried gloria tensely we've won
they reversed the decision
don't come in he murmured wanly you'll muss them
i'm sorting and i know you'll step in them
everything always gets mussed
what are you doing
demanded dick in astonishment
going back to childhood
don't you realize you've won the suit
they've reversed the decision of the lower courts
you're worth thirty millions
anthony only looked at him reproachfully
shut the door when you go out
he spoke like a pert child
with a faint horror dawning in her eyes gloria gazed at him  anthony
she cried what is it
what's the matter
why didn't you comewhy what is it
see here said anthony softly you two get outnow both of you
or else i'll tell my grandfather
he held up a handful of stamps and let them come drifting down about him like leaves varicolored and bright turning and fluttering gaudily upon the sunny air stamps of england and ecuador venezuela and spainitaly
together with the sparrows  that exquisite heavenly irony which has tabulated the demise of so many generations of sparrows doubtless records the subtlest verbal inflections of the passengers of such ships as the berengaria
and doubtless it was listening when the young man in the plaid cap crossed the deck quickly and spoke to the pretty girl in yellow
that's him he said pointing to a bundled figure seated in a wheel chair near the rail
that's anthony patch
first time he's been on deck
ohthat's him
yes
he's been a little crazy they say ever since he got his money four or five months ago
you see the other fellow shuttleworth the religious fellow the one that didn't get the money he locked himself up in a room in a hotel and shot himself  oh he did  but i guess anthony patch don't care much
he got his thirty million
and he's got his private physician along in case he doesn't feel just right about it
has she been on deck
he asked
the pretty girl in yellow looked around cautiously
she was here a minute ago
she had on a russiansable coat that must have cost a small fortune
she frowned and then added decisively i can't stand her you know
she seems sort ofsort of dyed and unclean if you know what i mean
some people just have that look about them whether they are or not
sure i know agreed the man with the plaid cap
she's not badlooking though
he paused
wonder what he's thinking abouthis money i guess or maybe he's got remorse about that fellow shuttleworth
probably  but the man in the plaid cap was quite wrong
anthony patch sitting near the rail and looking out at the sea was not thinking of his money for he had seldom in his life been really preoccupied with material vainglory nor of edward shuttleworth for it is best to look on the sunny side of these things
nohe was concerned with a series of reminiscences much as a general might look back upon a successful campaign and analyze his victories
he was thinking of the hardships the insufferable tribulations he had gone through
they had tried to penalize him for the mistakes of his youth
he had been exposed to ruthless misery his very craving for romance had been punished his friends had deserted himeven gloria had turned against him
he had been alone alonefacing it all
only a few months before people had been urging him to give in to submit to mediocrity to go to work
but he had known that he was justified in his way of lifeand he had stuck it out stanchly
why the very friends who had been most unkind had come to respect him to know he had been right all along
had not the lacys and the merediths and the cartwrightsmiths called on gloria and him at the ritzcarlton just a week before they sailed
great tears stood in his eyes and his voice was tremulous as he whispered to himself
i showed them he was saying
it was a hard fight but i didn't give up and i came through
