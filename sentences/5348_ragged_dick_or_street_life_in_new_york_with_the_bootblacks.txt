chapter i  ragged dick is introduced to the reader   wake up there youngster said a rough voice
ragged dick opened his eyes slowly and stared stupidly in the face of the speaker but did not offer to get up
wake up you young vagabond
said the man a little impatiently i suppose you'd lay there all day if i hadn't called you
what time is it
asked dick
seven o'clock
seven o'clock
i oughter've been up an hour ago
i know what 'twas made me so precious sleepy
i went to the old bowery last night and didn't turn in till past twelve
you went to the old bowery
where'd you get your money
asked the man who was a porter in the employ of a firm doing business on spruce street
made it by shines in course
my guardian don't allow me no money for theatres so i have to earn it
some boys get it easier than that said the porter significantly
you don't catch me stealin' if that's what you mean said dick
don't you ever steal then
no and i wouldn't
lots of boys does it but i wouldn't
well i'm glad to hear you say that
i believe there's some good in you dick after all
oh i'm a rough customer
said dick
but i wouldn't steal
it's mean
i'm glad you think so dick and the rough voice sounded gentler than at first
have you got any money to buy your breakfast
no but i'll soon get some
while this conversation had been going on dick had got up
his bedchamber had been a wooden box half full of straw on which the young bootblack had reposed his weary limbs and slept as soundly as if it had been a bed of down
he dumped down into the straw without taking the trouble of undressing
getting up too was an equally short process
he jumped out of the box shook himself picked out one or two straws that had found their way into rents in his clothes and drawing a wellworn cap over his uncombed locks he was all ready for the business of the day
dick's appearance as he stood beside the box was rather peculiar
his pants were torn in several places and had apparently belonged in the first instance to a boy two sizes larger than himself
he wore a vest all the buttons of which were gone except two out of which peeped a shirt which looked as if it had been worn a month
to complete his costume he wore a coat too long for him dating back if one might judge from its general appearance to a remote antiquity
washing the face and hands is usually considered proper in commencing the day but dick was above such refinement
he had no particular dislike to dirt and did not think it necessary to remove several dark streaks on his face and hands
but in spite of his dirt and rags there was something about dick that was attractive
it was easy to see that if he had been clean and well dressed he would have been decidedly goodlooking
some of his companions were sly and their faces inspired distrust but dick had a frank straightforward manner that made him a favorite
dick's business hours had commenced
he had no office to open
his little blackingbox was ready for use and he looked sharply in the faces of all who passed addressing each with shine yer boots sir
how much
asked a gentleman on his way to his office
ten cents said dick dropping his box and sinking upon his knees on the sidewalk flourishing his brush with the air of one skilled in his profession
ten cents
isn't that a little steep
well you know 'taint all clear profit said dick who had already set to work
there's the blacking costs something and i have to get a new brush pretty often
and you have a large rent too said the gentleman quizzically with a glance at a large hole in dick's coat
yes sir said dick always ready to joke i have to pay such a big rent for my manshun up on fifth avenoo that i can't afford to take less than ten cents a shine
i'll give you a bully shine sir
be quick about it for i am in a hurry
so your house is on fifth avenue is it
it isn't anywhere else said dick and dick spoke the truth there
what tailor do you patronize
asked the gentleman surveying dick's attire
would you like to go to the same one
asked dick shrewdly
well no it strikes me that he didn't give you a very good fit
this coat once belonged to general washington said dick comically
he wore it all through the revolution and it got torn some 'cause he fit so hard
when he died he told his widder to give it to some smart young feller that hadn't got none of his own so she gave it to me
but if you'd like it sir to remember general washington by i'll let you have it reasonable
thank you but i wouldn't want to deprive you of it
and did your pants come from general washington too
no they was a gift from lewis napoleon
lewis had outgrown 'em and sent 'em to mehe's bigger than me and that's why they don't fit
it seems you have distinguished friends
now my lad i suppose you would like your money
i shouldn't have any objection said dick
i believe said the gentleman examining his pocketbook i haven't got anything short of twentyfive cents
have you got any change
not a cent said dick
all my money's invested in the erie railroad
that's unfortunate
shall i get the money changed sir
i can't wait i've got to meet an appointment immediately
i'll hand you twentyfive cents and you can leave the change at my office any time during the day
all right sir
where is it
no
 fulton street
shall you remember
yes sir
what name
greysonoffice on second floor
all right sir i'll bring it
i wonder whether the little scamp will prove honest said mr greyson to himself as he walked away
if he does i'll give him my custom regularly
if he don't as is most likely i shan't mind the loss of fifteen cents
mr greyson didn't understand dick
our ragged hero wasn't a model boy in all respects
i am afraid he swore sometimes and now and then he played tricks upon unsophisticated boys from the country or gave a wrong direction to honest old gentlemen unused to the city
a clergyman in search of the cooper institute he once directed to the tombs prison and following him unobserved was highly delighted when the unsuspicious stranger walked up the front steps of the great stone building on centre street and tried to obtain admission
i guess he wouldn't want to stay long if he did get in thought ragged dick hitching up his pants
leastways i shouldn't
they're so precious glad to see you that they won't let you go but board you gratooitous and never send in no bills
another of dick's faults was his extravagance
being always wideawake and ready for business he earned enough to have supported him comfortably and respectably
there were not a few young clerks who employed dick from time to time in his professional capacity who scarcely earned as much as he greatly as their style and dress exceeded his
but dick was careless of his earnings
where they went he could hardly have told himself
however much he managed to earn during the day all was generally spent before morning
he was fond of going to the old bowery theatre and to tony pastor's and if he had any money left afterwards he would invite some of his friends in somewhere to have an oysterstew so it seldom happened that he commenced the day with a penny
then i am sorry to add that dick had formed the habit of smoking
this cost him considerable for dick was rather fastidious about his cigars and wouldn't smoke the cheapest
besides having a liberal nature he was generally ready to treat his companions
but of course the expense was the smallest objection
no boy of fourteen can smoke without being affected injuriously
men are frequently injured by smoking and boys always
but large numbers of the newsboys and bootblacks form the habit
exposed to the cold and wet they find that it warms them up and the selfindulgence grows upon them
it is not uncommon to see a little boy too young to be out of his mother's sight smoking with all the apparent satisfaction of a veteran smoker
there was another way in which dick sometimes lost money
there was a noted gamblinghouse on baxter street which in the evening was sometimes crowded with these juvenile gamesters who staked their hard earnings generally losing of course and refreshing themselves from time to time with a vile mixture of liquor at two cents a glass
sometimes dick strayed in here and played with the rest
i have mentioned dick's faults and defects because i want it understood to begin with that i don't consider him a model boy
but there were some good points about him nevertheless
he was above doing anything mean or dishonorable
he would not steal or cheat or impose upon younger boys but was frank and straightforward manly and selfreliant
his nature was a noble one and had saved him from all mean faults
i hope my young readers will like him as i do without being blind to his faults
perhaps although he was only a bootblack they may find something in him to imitate
and now having fairly introduced ragged dick to my young readers i must refer them to the next chapter for his further adventures
chapter ii  johnny nolan   after dick had finished polishing mr greyson's boots he was fortunate enough to secure three other customers two of them reporters in the tribune establishment which occupies the corner of spruce street and printing house square
when dick had got through with his last customer the city hall clock indicated eight o'clock
he had been up an hour and hard at work and naturally began to think of breakfast
he went up to the head of spruce street and turned into nassau
two blocks further and he reached ann street
on this street was a small cheap restaurant where for five cents dick could get a cup of coffee and for ten cents more a plate of beefsteak with a plate of bread thrown in
these dick ordered and sat down at a table
it was a small apartment with a few plain tables unprovided with cloths for the class of customers who patronized it were not very particular
our hero's breakfast was soon before him
neither the coffee nor the steak were as good as can be bought at delmonico's but then it is very doubtful whether in the present state of his wardrobe dick would have been received at that aristocratic restaurant even if his means had admitted of paying the high prices there charged
dick had scarcely been served when he espied a boy about his own size standing at the door looking wistfully into the restaurant
this was johnny nolan a boy of fourteen who was engaged in the same profession as ragged dick
his wardrobe was in very much the same condition as dick's
had your breakfast johnny
inquired dick cutting off a piece of steak
no
come in then
here's room for you
i aint got no money said johnny looking a little enviously at his more fortunate friend
haven't you had any shines
yes i had one but i shan't get any pay till tomorrow
are you hungry
try me and see
come in
i'll stand treat this morning
johnny nolan was nowise slow to accept this invitation and was soon seated beside dick
what'll you have johnny
same as you
cup o' coffee and beefsteak ordered dick
these were promptly brought and johnny attacked them vigorously
now in the bootblacking business as well as in higher avocations the same rule prevails that energy and industry are rewarded and indolence suffers
dick was energetic and on the alert for business but johnny the reverse
the consequence was that dick earned probably three times as much as the other
how do you like it
asked dick surveying johnny's attacks upon the steak with evident complacency
it's hunky
i don't believe hunky is to be found in either webster's or worcester's big dictionary but boys will readily understand what it means
do you come here often
asked johnny
most every day
you'd better come too
i can't afford it
well you'd ought to then said dick
what do you do i'd like to know
i don't get near as much as you dick
well you might if you tried
i keep my eyes openthat's the way i get jobs
you're lazy that's what's the matter
johnny did not see fit to reply to this charge
probably he felt the justice of it and preferred to proceed with the breakfast which he enjoyed the more as it cost him nothing
breakfast over dick walked up to the desk and settled the bill
then followed by johnny he went out into the street
where are you going johnny
up to mr taylor's on spruce street to see if he don't want a shine
do you work for him reg'lar
yes
him and his partner wants a shine most every day
where are you goin'
down front of the astor house
i guess i'll find some customers there
at this moment johnny started and dodging into an entry way hid behind the door considerably to dick's surprise
what's the matter now
asked our hero
has he gone
asked johnny his voice betraying anxiety
who gone i'd like to know
that man in the brown coat
what of him
you aint scared of him are you
yes he got me a place once
where
ever so far off
what if he did
i ran away
didn't you like it
no i had to get up too early
it was on a farm and i had to get up at five to take care of the cows
i like new york best
didn't they give you enough to eat
oh yes plenty
and you had a good bed
yes
then you'd better have stayed
you don't get either of them here
where'd you sleep last night
up an alley in an old wagon
you had a better bed than that in the country didn't you
yes it was as soft asas cotton
johnny had once slept on a bale of cotton the recollection supplying him with a comparison
why didn't you stay
i felt lonely said johnny
johnny could not exactly explain his feelings but it is often the case that the young vagabond of the streets though his food is uncertain and his bed may be any old wagon or barrel that he is lucky enough to find unoccupied when night sets in gets so attached to his precarious but independent mode of life that he feels discontented in any other
he is accustomed to the noise and bustle and evervaried life of the streets and in the quiet scenes of the country misses the excitement in the midst of which he has always dwelt
johnny had but one tie to bind him to the city
he had a father living but he might as well have been without one
mr nolan was a confirmed drunkard and spent the greater part of his wages for liquor
his potations made him ugly and inflamed a temper never very sweet working him up sometimes to such a pitch of rage that johnny's life was in danger
some months before he had thrown a flatiron at his son's head with such terrific force that unless johnny had dodged he would not have lived long enough to obtain a place in our story
he fled the house and from that time had not dared to reenter it
somebody had given him a brush and box of blacking and he had set up in business on his own account
but he had not energy enough to succeed as has already been stated and i am afraid the poor boy had met with many hardships and suffered more than once from cold and hunger
dick had befriended him more than once and often given him a breakfast or dinner as the case might be
how'd you get away
asked dick with some curiosity
did you walk
no i rode on the cars
where'd you get your money
i hope you didn't steal it
i didn't have none
what did you do then
i got up about three o'clock and walked to albany
where's that
asked dick whose ideas on the subject of geography were rather vague
up the river
how far
about a thousand miles said johnny whose conceptions of distance were equally vague
go ahead
what did you do then
i hid on top of a freight car and came all the way without their seeing me
 that man in the brown coat was the man that got me the place and i'm afraid he'd want to send me back
 a fact
well said dick reflectively i dunno as i'd like to live in the country
i couldn't go to tony pastor's or the old bowery
there wouldn't be no place to spend my evenings
but i say it's tough in winter johnny 'specially when your overcoat's at the tailor's an' likely to stay there
that's so dick
but i must be goin' or mr taylor'll get somebody else to shine his boots
johnny walked back to nassau street while dick kept on his way to broadway
that boy soliloquized dick as johnny took his departure aint got no ambition
i'll bet he won't get five shines today
i'm glad i aint like him
i couldn't go to the theatre nor buy no cigars nor get half as much as i wanted to eatshine yer boots sir
dick always had an eye to business and this remark was addressed to a young man dressed in a stylish manner who was swinging a jaunty cane
i've had my boots blacked once already this morning but this confounded mud has spoiled the shine
i'll make 'em all right sir in a minute
go ahead then
the boots were soon polished in dick's best style which proved very satisfactory our hero being a proficient in the art
i haven't got any change said the young man fumbling in his pocket but here's a bill you may run somewhere and get changed
i'll pay you five cents extra for your trouble
he handed dick a twodollar bill which our hero took into a store close by
will you please change that sir
said dick walking up to the counter
the salesman to whom he proffered it took the bill and slightly glancing at it exclaimed angrily be off you young vagabond or i'll have you arrested
what's the row
you've offered me a counterfeit bill
i didn't know it said dick
don't tell me
be off or i'll have you arrested
chapter iii  dick makes a proposition   though dick was somewhat startled at discovering that the bill he had offered was counterfeit he stood his ground bravely
clear out of this shop you young vagabond repeated the clerk
then give me back my bill
that you may pass it again
no sir i shall do no such thing
it doesn't belong to me said dick
a gentleman that owes me for a shine gave it to me to change
a likely story said the clerk but he seemed a little uneasy
i'll go and call him said dick
he went out and found his late customer standing on the astor house steps
well youngster have you brought back my change
you were a precious long time about it
i began to think you had cleared out with the money
that aint my style said dick proudly
then where's the change
i haven't got it
where's the bill then
i haven't got that either
you young rascal
hold on a minute mister said dick and i'll tell you all about it
the man what took the bill said it wasn't good and kept it
the bill was perfectly good
so he kept it did he
i'll go with you to the store and see whether he won't give it back to me
dick led the way and the gentleman followed him into the store
at the reappearance of dick in such company the clerk flushed a little and looked nervous
he fancied that he could browbeat a ragged bootblack but with a gentleman he saw that it would be a different matter
he did not seem to notice the newcomers but began to replace some goods on the shelves
now said the young man point out the clerk that has my money
that's him said dick pointing out the clerk
the gentleman walked up to the counter
i will trouble you he said a little haughtily for a bill which that boy offered you and which you still hold in your possession
it was a bad bill said the clerk his cheek flushing and his manner nervous
it was no such thing
i require you to produce it and let the matter be decided
the clerk fumbled in his vestpocket and drew out a badlooking bill
this is a bad bill but it is not the one i gave the boy
it is the one he gave me
the young man looked doubtful
boy he said to dick is this the bill you gave to be changed
no it isn't
you lie you young rascal
exclaimed the clerk who began to find himself in a tight place and could not see the way out
this scene naturally attracted the attention of all in the store and the proprietor walked up from the lower end where he had been busy
what's all this mr
hatch
he demanded
that boy said the clerk came in and asked change for a bad bill
i kept the bill and told him to clear out
now he wants it again to pass on somebody else
show the bill
the merchant looked at it
yes that's a bad bill he said
there is no doubt about that
but it is not the one the boy offered said dick's patron
it is one of the same denomination but on a different bank
do you remember what bank it was on
it was on the merchants' bank of boston
are you sure of it
i am
perhaps the boy kept it and offered the other
you may search me if you want to said dick indignantly
he doesn't look as if he was likely to have any extra bills
i suspect that your clerk pocketed the good bill and has substituted the counterfeit note
it is a nice little scheme of his for making money
i haven't seen any bill on the merchants' bank said the clerk doggedly
you had better feel in your pockets
this matter must be investigated said the merchant firmly
if you have the bill produce it
i haven't got it said the clerk but he looked guilty notwithstanding
i demand that he be searched said dick's patron
i tell you i haven't got it
shall i send for a police officer mr hatch or will you allow yourself to be searched quietly
said the merchant
alarmed at the threat implied in these words the clerk put his hand into his vestpocket and drew out a twodollar bill on the merchants' bank
is this your note
asked the shopkeeper showing it to the young man
it is
i must have made a mistake faltered the clerk
i shall not give you a chance to make such another mistake in my employ said the merchant sternly
you may go up to the desk and ask for what wages are due you
i shall have no further occasion for your services
now youngster said dick's patron as they went out of the store after he had finally got the bill changed
i must pay you something extra for your trouble
here's fifty cents
thank you sir said dick
you're very kind
don't you want some more bills changed
not today said he with a smile
it's too expensive
i'm in luck thought our hero complacently
i guess i'll go to barnum's tonight and see the bearded lady the eightfoot giant the twofoot dwarf and the other curiosities too numerous to mention
dick shouldered his box and walked up as far as the astor house
he took his station on the sidewalk and began to look about him
just behind him were two personsone a gentleman of fifty the other a boy of thirteen or fourteen
they were speaking together and dick had no difficulty in hearing what was said
i am sorry frank that i can't go about and show you some of the sights of new york but i shall be full of business today
it is your first visit to the city too
yes sir
there's a good deal worth seeing here
but i'm afraid you'll have to wait to next time
you can go out and walk by yourself but don't venture too far or you will get lost
frank looked disappointed
i wish tom miles knew i was here he said
he would go around with me
where does he live
somewhere up town i believe
then unfortunately he is not available
if you would rather go with me than stay here you can but as i shall be most of the time in merchants'countingrooms i am afraid it would not be very interesting
i think said frank after a little hesitation that i will go off by myself
i won't go very far and if i lose my way i will inquire for the astor house
yes anybody will direct you here
very well frank i am sorry i can't do better for you
oh never mind uncle i shall be amused in walking around and looking at the shopwindows
there will be a great deal to see
now dick had listened to all this conversation
being an enterprising young man he thought he saw a chance for a speculation and determined to avail himself of it
accordingly he stepped up to the two just as frank's uncle was about leaving and said i know all about the city sir i'll show him around if you want me to
the gentleman looked a little curiously at the ragged figure before him
so you are a city boy are you
yes sir said dick i've lived here ever since i was a baby
and you know all about the public buildings i suppose
yes sir
and the central park
yes sir
i know my way all round
the gentleman looked thoughtful
i don't know what to say frank he remarked after a while
it is rather a novel proposal
he isn't exactly the sort of guide i would have picked out for you
still he looks honest
he has an open face and i think can be depended upon
i wish he wasn't so ragged and dirty said frank who felt a little shy about being seen with such a companion
i'm afraid you haven't washed your face this morning said mr whitney for that was the gentleman's name
they didn't have no washbowls at the hotel where i stopped said dick
what hotel did you stop at
the box hotel
the box hotel
yes sir i slept in a box on spruce street
frank surveyed dick curiously
how did you like it
he asked
i slept bully
suppose it had rained
then i'd have wet my best clothes said dick
are these all the clothes you have
yes sir
mr whitney spoke a few words to frank who seemed pleased with the suggestion
follow me my lad he said
dick in some surprise obeyed orders following mr whitney and frank into the hotel past the office to the foot of the staircase
here a servant of the hotel stopped dick but mr whitney explained that he had something for him to do and he was allowed to proceed
they entered a long entry and finally paused before a door
this being opened a pleasant chamber was disclosed
come in my lad said mr whitney
dick and frank entered
chapter iv  dick's new suit   now said mr whitney to dick my nephew here is on his way to a boardingschool
he has a suit of clothes in his trunk about half worn
he is willing to give them to you
i think they will look better than those you have on
dick was so astonished that he hardly knew what to say
presents were something that he knew very little about never having received any to his knowledge
that so large a gift should be made to him by a stranger seemed very wonderful
the clothes were brought out and turned out to be a neat gray suit
before you put them on my lad you must wash yourself
clean clothes and a dirty skin don't go very well together
frank you may attend to him
i am obliged to go at once
have you got as much money as you require
yes uncle
one more word my lad said mr whitney addressing dick i may be rash in trusting a boy of whom i know nothing but i like your looks and i think you will prove a proper guide for my nephew
yes i will sir said dick earnestly
honor bright
very well
a pleasant time to you
the process of cleansing commenced
to tell the truth dick needed it and the sensation of cleanliness he found both new and pleasant
frank added to his gift a shirt stockings and an old pair of shoes
i am sorry i haven't any cap said he
i've got one said dick
it isn't so new as it might be said frank surveying an old felt hat which had once been black but was now dingy with a large hole in the top and a portion of the rim torn off
no said dick my grandfather used to wear it when he was a boy and i've kep' it ever since out of respect for his memory
but i'll get a new one now
i can buy one cheap on chatham street
is that near here
only five minutes' walk
then we can get one on the way
when dick was dressed in his new attire with his face and hands clean and his hair brushed it was difficult to imagine that he was the same boy
he now looked quite handsome and might readily have been taken for a young gentleman except that his hands were red and grimy
look at yourself said frank leading him before the mirror
by gracious
said dick starting back in astonishment that isn't me is it
don't you know yourself
asked frank smiling
it reminds me of cinderella said dick when she was changed into a fairy princess
i see it one night at barnum's
what'll johnny nolan say when he sees me
he won't dare to speak to such a young swell as i be now
aint it rich
and dick burst into a loud laugh
his fancy was tickled by the anticipation of his friend's surprise
then the thought of the valuable gifts he had received occurred to him and he looked gratefully at frank
you're a brick he said
a what
a brick
you're a jolly good fellow to give me such a present
you're quite welcome dick said frank kindly
i'm better off than you are and i can spare the clothes just as well as not
you must have a new hat though
but that we can get when we go out
the old clothes you can make into a bundle
wait a minute till i get my handkercher and dick pulled from the pocket of the pants a dirty rag which might have been white once though it did not look like it and had apparently once formed a part of a sheet or shirt
you mustn't carry that said frank
but i've got a cold said dick
oh i don't mean you to go without a handkerchief
i'll give you one
frank opened his trunk and pulled out two which he gave to dick
i wonder if i aint dreamin' said dick once more surveying himself doubtfully in the glass
i'm afraid i'm dreamin' and shall wake up in a barrel as i did night afore last
shall i pinch you so you can wake here
asked frank playfully
yes said dick seriously i wish you would
he pulled up the sleeve of his jacket and frank pinched him pretty hard so that dick winced
yes i guess i'm awake said dick you've got a pair of nippers you have
but what shall i do with my brush and blacking
he asked
you can leave them here till we come back said frank
they will be safe
hold on a minute said dick surveying frank's boots with a professional eye you aint got a good shine on them boots
i'll make 'em shine so you can see your face in 'em
and he was as good as his word
thank you said frank now you had better brush your own shoes
this had not occurred to dick for in general the professional bootblack considers his blacking too valuable to expend on his own shoes or boots if he is fortunate enough to possess a pair
the two boys now went downstairs together
they met the same servant who had spoken to dick a few minutes before but there was no recognition
he don't know me said dick
he thinks i'm a young swell like you
what's a swell
oh a feller that wears nobby clothes like you
and you too dick
yes said dick who'd ever have thought as i should have turned into a swell
they had now got out on broadway and were slowly walking along the west side by the park when who should dick see in front of him but johnny nolan
instantly dick was seized with a fancy for witnessing johnny's amazement at his change in appearance
he stole up behind him and struck him on the back
hallo johnny how many shines have you had
johnny turned round expecting to see dick whose voice he recognized but his astonished eyes rested on a nicely dressed boy the hat alone excepted who looked indeed like dick but so transformed in dress that it was difficult to be sure of his identity
what luck johnny
repeated dick
johnny surveyed him from head to foot in great bewilderment
who be you
he said
well that's a good one laughed dick so you don't know dick
where'd you get all them clothes
asked johnny
have you been stealin'
say that again and i'll lick you
no i've lent my clothes to a young feller as was goin' to a party and didn't have none fit to wear and so i put on my secondbest for a change
without deigning any further explanation dick went off followed by the astonished gaze of johnny nolan who could not quite make up his mind whether the neatlooking boy he had been talking with was really ragged dick or not
in order to reach chatham street it was necessary to cross broadway
this was easier proposed than done
there is always such a throng of omnibuses drays carriages and vehicles of all kinds in the neighborhood of the astor house that the crossing is formidable to one who is not used to it
dick made nothing of it dodging in and out among the horses and wagons with perfect selfpossession
reaching the opposite sidewalk he looked back and found that frank had retreated in dismay and that the width of the street was between them
come across
called out dick
i don't see any chance said frank looking anxiously at the prospect before him
i'm afraid of being run over
if you are you can sue 'em for damages said dick
finally frank got safely over after several narrow escapes as he considered them
is it always so crowded
he asked
a good deal worse sometimes said dick
i knowed a young man once who waited six hours for a chance to cross and at last got run over by an omnibus leaving a widder and a large family of orphan children
his widder a beautiful young woman was obliged to start a peanut and apple stand
there she is now
where
dick pointed to a hideous old woman of large proportions wearing a bonnet of immense size who presided over an applestand close by
frank laughed
if that is the case he said i think i will patronize her
leave it to me said dick winking
he advanced gravely to the applestand and said old lady have you paid your taxes
the astonished woman opened her eyes
i'm a gov'ment officer said dick sent by the mayor to collect your taxes
i'll take it in apples just to oblige
that big red one will about pay what you're owin' to the gov'ment
i don't know nothing about no taxes said the old woman in bewilderment
then said dick i'll let you off this time
give us two of your best apples and my friend here the president of the common council will pay you
frank smiling paid three cents apiece for the apples and they sauntered on dick remarking if these apples aint good old lady we'll return 'em and get our money back
this would have been rather difficult in his case as the apple was already half consumed
chatham street where they wished to go being on the east side the two boys crossed the park
this is an enclosure of about ten acres which years ago was covered with a green sward but is now a great thoroughfare for pedestrians and contains several important public buildings
dick pointed out the city hall the hall of records and the rotunda
the former is a white building of large size and surmounted by a cupola
that's where the mayor's office is said dick
him and me are very good friends
i once blacked his boots by partic'lar appointment
that's the way i pay my city taxes
chapter v  chatham street and broadway   they were soon in chatham street walking between rows of readymade clothing shops many of which had half their stock in trade exposed on the sidewalk
the proprietors of these establishments stood at the doors watching attentively the passersby extending urgent invitations to any who even glanced at the goods to enter
walk in young gentlemen said a stout man at the entrance of one shop
no i thank you replied dick as the fly said to the spider
we're selling off at less than cost
of course you be
that's where you makes your money said dick
there aint nobody of any enterprise that pretends to make any profit on his goods
the chatham street trader looked after our hero as if he didn't quite comprehend him but dick without waiting for a reply passed on with his companion
in some of the shops auctions seemed to be going on
i am only offered two dollars gentlemen for this elegant pair of doeskin pants made of the very best of cloth
it's a frightful sacrifice
who'll give an eighth
thank you sir
only seventeen shillings
why the cloth cost more by the yard
this speaker was standing on a little platform haranguing to three men holding in his hand meanwhile a pair of pants very loose in the legs and presenting a cheap bowery look
frank and dick paused before the shop door and finally saw them knocked down to rather a verdantlooking individual at three dollars
clothes seem to be pretty cheap here said frank
yes but baxter street is the cheapest place
is it
yes
johnny nolan got a whole rigout there last week for a dollarcoat cap vest pants and shoes
they was very good measure too like my best clothes that i took off to oblige you
i shall know where to come for clothes next time said frank laughing
i had no idea the city was so much cheaper than the country
i suppose the baxter street tailors are fashionable
in course they are
me and horace greeley always go there for clothes
when horace gets a new suit i always have one made just like it but i can't go the white hat
it aint becomin' to my style of beauty
a little farther on a man was standing out on the sidewalk distributing small printed handbills
one was handed to frank which he read as follows  grand closingout salea variety of beautiful and costly articles for sale at a dollar apiece
unparalleled inducements
walk in gentlemen
whereabouts is this sale
asked frank
in here young gentlemen said a blackwhiskered individual who appeared suddenly on the scene
walk in
shall we go in dick
it's a swindlin' shop said dick in a low voice
i've been there
that man's a regular cheat
he's seen me before but he don't know me coz of my clothes
step in and see the articles said the man persuasively
you needn't buy you know
are all the articles worth more'n a dollar
asked dick
yes said the other and some worth a great deal more
such as what
well there's a silver pitcher worth twenty dollars
and you sell it for a dollar
that's very kind of you said dick innocently
walk in and you'll understand it
no i guess not said dick
my servants is so dishonest that i wouldn't like to trust 'em with a silver pitcher
come along frank
i hope you'll succeed in your charitable enterprise of supplyin' the public with silver pitchers at nineteen dollars less than they are worth
how does he manage dick
asked frank as they went on
all his articles are numbered and he makes you pay a dollar and then shakes some dice and whatever the figgers come to is the number of the article you draw
most of 'em aint worth sixpence
a hat and cap store being close at hand dick and frank went in
for seventyfive cents which frank insisted on paying dick succeeded in getting quite a neatlooking cap which corresponded much better with his appearance than the one he had on
the last not being considered worth keeping dick dropped on the sidewalk from which on looking back he saw it picked up by a brother bootblack who appeared to consider it better than his own
they retraced their steps and went up chambers street to broadway
at the corner of broadway and chambers street is a large white marble warehouse which attracted frank's attention
what building is that
he asked with interest
that belongs to my friend a t stewart said dick
it's the biggest store on broadway
 if i ever retire from bootblackin' and go into mercantile pursuits i may buy him out or build another store that'll take the shine off this one
 mr stewart's tenth street store was not open at the time dick spoke
were you ever in the store
asked frank
no said dick but i'm intimate with one of stewart's partners
he is a cash boy and does nothing but take money all day
a very agreeable employment said frank laughing
yes said dick i'd like to be in it
the boys crossed to the west side of broadway and walked slowly up the street
to frank it was a very interesting spectacle
accustomed to the quiet of the country there was something fascinating in the crowds of people thronging the sidewalks and the great variety of vehicles constantly passing and repassing in the street
then again the shopwindows with their multifarious contents interested and amused him and he was constantly checking dick to look in at some wellstocked window
i don't see how so many shopkeepers can find people enough to buy of them he said
we haven't got but two stores in our village and broadway seems to be full of them
yes said dick and its pretty much the same in the avenoos 'specially the third sixth and eighth avenoos
the bowery too is a great place for shoppin'
there everybody sells cheaper'n anybody else and nobody pretends to make no profit on their goods
where's barnum's museum
asked frank
oh that's down nearly opposite the astor house said dick
didn't you see a great building with lots of flags
yes
well that's barnum's
 that's where the happy family live and the lions and bears and curiosities generally
it's a tiptop place
haven't you ever been there
it's most as good as the old bowery only the plays isn't quite so excitin'
 since destroyed by fire and rebuilt farther up broadway and again burned down in february
i'll go if i get time said frank
there is a boy at home who came to new york a month ago and went to barnum's and has been talking about it ever since so i suppose it must be worth seeing
they've got a great play at the old bowery now pursued dick
'tis called the 'demon of the danube'
the demon falls in love with a young woman and drags her by the hair up to the top of a steep rock where his castle stands
that's a queer way of showing his love said frank laughing
she didn't want to go with him you know but was in love with another chap
when he heard about his girl bein' carried off he felt awful and swore an oath not to rest till he had got her free
well at last he got into the castle by some underground passage and he and the demon had a fight
oh it was bully seein' 'em roll round on the stage cuttin' and slashin' at each other
and which got the best of it
at first the demon seemed to be ahead but at last the young baron got him down and struck a dagger into his heart sayin' 'die false and perjured villain
the dogs shall feast upon thy carcass'
and then the demon give an awful howl and died
then the baron seized his body and threw it over the precipice
it seems to me the actor who plays the demon ought to get extra pay if he has to be treated that way
that's so said dick but i guess he's used to it
it seems to agree with his constitution
what building is that
asked frank pointing to a structure several rods back from the street with a large yard in front
it was an unusual sight for broadway all the other buildings in that neighborhood being even with the street
that is the new york hospital said dick
they're a rich institution and take care of sick people on very reasonable terms
did you ever go in there
yes said dick there was a friend of mine johnny mullen he was a newsboy got run over by a omnibus as he was crossin' broadway down near park place
he was carried to the hospital and me and some of his friends paid his board while he was there
it was only three dollars a week which was very cheap considerin' all the care they took of him
i got leave to come and see him while he was here
everything looked so nice and comfortable that i thought a little of coaxin' a omnibus driver to run over me so i might go there too
did your friend have to have his leg cut off
asked frank interested
no said dick though there was a young student there that was very anxious to have it cut off but it wasn't done and johnny is around the streets as well as ever
while this conversation was going on they reached no
 at the corner of franklin street
   now the office of the merchants' union express company
that's taylor's saloon said dick
when i come into a fortun' i shall take my meals there reg'lar
i have heard of it very often said frank
it is said to be very elegant
suppose we go in and take an icecream
it will give us a chance to see it to better advantage
thank you said dick i think that's the most agreeable way of seein' the place myself
the boys entered and found themselves in a spacious and elegant saloon resplendent with gilding and adorned on all sides by costly mirrors
they sat down to a small table with a marble top and frank gave the order
it reminds me of aladdin's palace said frank looking about him
does it
said dick he must have had plenty of money
he had an old lamp which he had only to rub when the slave of the lamp would appear and do whatever he wanted
that must have been a valooable lamp
i'd be willin' to give all my erie shares for it
there was a tall gaunt individual at the next table who apparently heard this last remark of dick's
turning towards our hero he said may i inquire young man whether you are largely interested in this erie railroad
i haven't got no property except what's invested in erie said dick with a comical sideglance at frank
indeed
i suppose the investment was made by your guardian
no said dick i manage my property myself
and i presume your dividends have not been large
why no said dick you're about right there
they haven't
as i supposed
it's poor stock
now my young friend i can recommend a much better investment which will yield you a large annual income
i am agent of the excelsior copper mining company which possesses one of the most productive mines in the world
it's sure to yield fifty per cent
on the investment
now all you have to do is to sell out your erie shares and invest in our stock and i'll insure you a fortune in three years
how many shares did you say you had
i didn't say that i remember said dick
your offer is very kind and obligin' and as soon as i get time i'll see about it
i hope you will said the stranger
permit me to give you my card
'samuel snap no
 wall street'
i shall be most happy to receive a call from you and exhibit the maps of our mine
i should be glad to have you mention the matter also to your friends
i am confident you could do no greater service than to induce them to embark in our enterprise
very good said dick
here the stranger left the table and walked up to the desk to settle his bill
you see what it is to be a man of fortun' frank said dick and wear good clothes
i wonder what that chap'll say when he sees me blackin' boots tomorrow in the street
perhaps you earn your money more honorably than he does after all said frank
some of these mining companies are nothing but swindles got up to cheat people out of their money
he's welcome to all he gets out of me said dick
chapter vi  up broadway to madison square   as the boys pursued their way up broadway dick pointed out the prominent hotels and places of amusement
frank was particularly struck with the imposing fronts of the st nicholas and metropolitan hotels the former of white marble the latter of a subdued brown hue but not less elegant in its internal appointments
he was not surprised to be informed that each of these splendid structures cost with the furnishing not far from a million dollars
at eighth street dick turned to the right and pointed out the clinton hall building now occupied by the mercantile library comprising at that time over fifty thousand volumes
   now not far from one hundred thousand
a little farther on they came to a large building standing by itself just at the opening of third and fourth avenues and with one side on each
what is that building
asked frank
that's the cooper institute said dick built by mr cooper a particular friend of mine
me and peter cooper used to go to school together
what is there inside
asked frank
there's a hall for public meetin's and lectures in the basement and a readin' room and a picture gallery up above said dick
directly opposite cooper institute frank saw a very large building of brick covering about an acre of ground
is that a hotel
he asked
no said dick that's the bible house
it's the place where they make bibles
i was in there oncesaw a big pile of 'em
did you ever read the bible
asked frank who had some idea of the neglected state of dick's education
no said dick i've heard it's a good book but i never read one
i aint much on readin'
it makes my head ache
i suppose you can't read very fast
i can read the little words pretty well but the big ones is what stick me
if i lived in the city you might come every evening to me and i would teach you
would you take so much trouble about me
asked dick earnestly
certainly i should like to see you getting on
there isn't much chance of that if you don't know how to read and write
you're a good feller said dick gratefully
i wish you did live in new york
i'd like to know somethin'
whereabouts do you live
about fifty miles off in a town on the left bank of the hudson
i wish you'd come up and see me sometime
i would like to have you come and stop two or three days
honor bright
i don't understand
do you mean it
asked dick incredulously
of course i do
why shouldn't i
what would your folks say if they knowed you asked a bootblack to visit you
you are none the worse for being a bootblack dick
i aint used to genteel society said dick
i shouldn't know how to behave
then i could show you
you won't be a bootblack all your life you know
no said dick i'm goin' to knock off when i get to be ninety
before that i hope said frank smiling
i really wish i could get somethin' else to do said dick soberly
i'd like to be a office boy and learn business and grow up 'spectable
why don't you try and see if you can't get a place dick
who'd take ragged dick
but you aint ragged now dick
no said dick i look a little better than i did in my washington coat and louis napoleon pants
but if i got in a office they wouldn't give me more'n three dollars a week and i couldn't live 'spectable on that
no i suppose not said frank thoughtfully
but you would get more at the end of the first year
yes said dick but by that time i'd be nothin' but skin and bones
frank laughed
that reminds me he said of the story of an irishman who out of economy thought he would teach his horse to feed on shavings
so he provided the horse with a pair of green spectacles which made the shavings look eatable
but unfortunately just as the horse got learned he up and died
the hoss must have been a fine specimen of architectur' by the time he got through remarked dick
whereabouts are we now
asked frank as they emerged from fourth avenue into union square
that is union park said dick pointing to a beautiful enclosure in the centre of which was a pond with a fountain playing
is that the statue of general washington
asked frank pointing to a bronze equestrian statue on a granite pedestal
yes said dick he's growed some since he was president
if he'd been as tall as that when he fit in the revolution he'd have walloped the britishers some i reckon
frank looked up at the statue which is fourteen and a half feet high and acknowledged the justice of dick's remark
how about the coat dick
he asked
would it fit you
well it might be rather loose said dick i aint much more'n ten feet high with my boots off
no i should think not said frank smiling
you're a queer boy dick
well i've been brought up queer
some boys is born with a silver spoon in their mouth
victoria's boys is born with a gold spoon set with di'monds but gold and silver was scarce when i was born and mine was pewter
perhaps the gold and silver will come by and by dick
did you ever hear of dick whittington
never did
was he a ragged dick
i shouldn't wonder if he was
at any rate he was very poor when he was a boy but he didn't stay so
before he died he became lord mayor of london
did he
asked dick looking interested
how did he do it
why you see a rich merchant took pity on him and gave him a home in his own house where he used to stay with the servants being employed in little errands
one day the merchant noticed dick picking up pins and needles that had been dropped and asked him why he did it
dick told him he was going to sell them when he got enough
the merchant was pleased with his saving disposition and when soon after he was going to send a vessel to foreign parts he told dick he might send anything he pleased in it and it should be sold to his advantage
now dick had nothing in the world but a kitten which had been given him a short time before
how much taxes did he have to pay on it
asked dick
not very high probably
but having only the kitten he concluded to send it along
after sailing a good many months during which the kitten grew up to be a strong cat the ship touched at an island never before known which happened to be infested with rats and mice to such an extent that they worried everybody's life out and even ransacked the king's palace
to make a long story short the captain seeing how matters stood brought dick's cat ashore and she soon made the rats and mice scatter
the king was highly delighted when he saw what havoc she made among the rats and mice and resolved to have her at any price
so he offered a great quantity of gold for her which of course the captain was glad to accept
it was faithfully carried back to dick and laid the foundation of his fortune
he prospered as he grew up and in time became a very rich merchant respected by all and before he died was elected lord mayor of london
that's a pretty good story said dick but i don't believe all the cats in new york will ever make me mayor
no probably not but you may rise in some other way
a good many distinguished men have once been poor boys
there's hope for you dick if you'll try
nobody ever talked to me so before said dick
they just called me ragged dick and told me i'd grow up to be a vagabone boys who are better educated need not be surprised at dick's blunders and come to the gallows
telling you so won't make it turn out so dick
if you'll try to be somebody and grow up into a respectable member of society you will
you may not become richit isn't everybody that becomes rich you knowbut you can obtain a good position and be respected
i'll try said dick earnestly
i needn't have been ragged dick so long if i hadn't spent my money in goin' to the theatre and treatin' boys to oysterstews and bettin' money on cards and such like
have you lost money that way
lots of it
one time i saved up five dollars to buy me a new rigout cos my best suit was all in rags when limpy jim wanted me to play a game with him
limpy jim
said frank interrogatively
yes he's lame that's what makes us call him limpy jim
i suppose you lost
yes i lost every penny and had to sleep out cos i hadn't a cent to pay for lodgin'
'twas a awful cold night and i got most froze
wouldn't jim let you have any of the money he had won to pay for a lodging
no i axed him for five cents but he wouldn't let me have it
can you get lodging for five cents
asked frank in surprise
yes said dick but not at the fifth avenue hotel
that's it right out there
chapter vii  the pocketbook   they had reached the junction of broadway and of fifth avenue
before them was a beautiful park of ten acres
on the lefthand side was a large marble building presenting a fine appearance with its extensive white front
this was the building at which dick pointed
is that the fifth avenue hotel
asked frank
i've heard of it often
my uncle william always stops there when he comes to new york
i once slept on the outside of it said dick
they was very reasonable in their charges and told me i might come again
perhaps sometime you'll be able to sleep inside said frank
i guess that'll be when queen victoria goes to the five points to live
it looks like a palace said frank
the queen needn't be ashamed to live in such a beautiful building as that
though frank did not know it one of the queen's palaces is far from being as fine a looking building as the fifth avenue hotel
st james' palace is a very uglylooking brick structure and appears much more like a factory than like the home of royalty
there are few hotels in the world as finelooking as this democratic institution
at that moment a gentleman passed them on the sidewalk who looked back at dick as if his face seemed familiar
i know that man said dick after he had passed
he's one of my customers
what is his name
i don't know
he looked back as if he thought he knew you
he would have knowed me at once if it hadn't been for my new clothes said dick
i don't look much like ragged dick now
i suppose your face looked familiar
all but the dirt said dick laughing
i don't always have the chance of washing my face and hands in the astor house
you told me said frank that there was a place where you could get lodging for five cents
where's that
it's the newsboys' lodgin' house on fulton street said dick up over the 'sun' office
it's a good place
i don't know what us boys would do without it
they give you supper for six cents and a bed for five cents more
i suppose some boys don't even have the five cents to paydo they
they'll trust the boys said dick
but i don't like to get trusted
i'd be ashamed to get trusted for five cents or ten either
one night i was comin' down chatham street with fifty cents in my pocket
i was goin' to get a good oysterstew and then go to the lodgin' house but somehow it slipped through a hole in my trowsespocket and i hadn't a cent left
if it had been summer i shouldn't have cared but it's rather tough stayin' out winter nights
frank who had always possessed a good home of his own found it hard to realize that the boy who was walking at his side had actually walked the streets in the cold without a home or money to procure the common comfort of a bed
what did you do
he asked his voice full of sympathy
i went to the 'times' office
i knowed one of the pressmen and he let me set down in a corner where i was warm and i soon got fast asleep
why don't you get a room somewhere and so always have a home to go to
i dunno said dick
i never thought of it
p'rhaps i may hire a furnished house on madison square
that's where flora mcflimsey lived
i don't know her said dick who had never read the popular poem of which she is the heroine
while this conversation was going on they had turned into twentyfifth street and had by this time reached third avenue
just before entering it their attention was drawn to the rather singular conduct of an individual in front of them
stopping suddenly he appeared to pick up something from the sidewalk and then looked about him in rather a confused way
i know his game whispered dick
come along and you'll see what it is
he hurried frank forward until they overtook the man who had come to a standstill
have you found anything
asked dick
yes said the man i've found this
he exhibited a wallet which seemed stuffed with bills to judge from its plethoric appearance
whew
exclaimed dick you're in luck
i suppose somebody has lost it said the man and will offer a handsome reward
which you'll get
unfortunately i am obliged to take the next train to boston
that's where i live
i haven't time to hunt up the owner
then i suppose you'll take the pocketbook with you said dick with assumed simplicity
i should like to leave it with some honest fellow who would see it returned to the owner said the man glancing at the boys
i'm honest said dick
i've no doubt of it said the other
well young man i'll make you an offer
you take the pocketbook  all right
hand it over then
wait a minute
there must be a large sum inside
i shouldn't wonder if there might be a thousand dollars
the owner will probably give you a hundred dollars reward
why don't you stay and get it
asked frank
i would only there is sickness in my family and i must get home as soon as possible
just give me twenty dollars and i'll hand you the pocketbook and let you make whatever you can out of it
come that's a good offer
what do you say
dick was well dressed so that the other did not regard it as at all improbable that he might possess that sum
he was prepared however to let him have it for less if necessary
twenty dollars is a good deal of money said dick appearing to hesitate
you'll get it back and a good deal more said the stranger persuasively
i don't know but i shall
what would you do frank
i don't know but i would said frank if you've got the money
he was not a little surprised to think that dick had so much by him
i don't know but i will said dick after some irresolution
i guess i won't lose much
you can't lose anything said the stranger briskly
only be quick for i must be on my way to the cars
i am afraid i shall miss them now
dick pulled out a bill from his pocket and handed it to the stranger receiving the pocketbook in return
at that moment a policeman turned the corner and the stranger hurriedly thrusting the bill into his pocket without looking at it made off with rapid steps
what is there in the pocketbook dick
asked frank in some excitement
i hope there's enough to pay you for the money you gave him
dick laughed
i'll risk that said he
but you gave him twenty dollars
that's a good deal of money
if i had given him as much as that i should deserve to be cheated out of it
but you diddidn't you
he thought so
what was it then
it was nothing but a drygoods circular got up to imitate a bankbill
frank looked sober
you ought not to have cheated him dick he said reproachfully
didn't he want to cheat me
i don't know
what do you s'pose there is in that pocketbook
asked dick holding it up
frank surveyed its ample proportions and answered sincerely enough money and a good deal of it
there aint stamps enough in it to buy a oysterstew said dick
if you don't believe it just look while i open it
so saying he opened the pocketbook and showed frank that it was stuffed out with pieces of blank paper carefully folded up in the shape of bills
frank who was unused to city life and had never heard anything of the dropgame looked amazed at this unexpected development
i knowed how it was all the time said dick
i guess i got the best of him there
this wallet's worth somethin'
i shall use it to keep my stiffkit's of erie stock in and all my other papers what aint of no use to anybody but the owner
that's the kind of papers it's got in it now said frank smiling
that's so
said dick
by hokey
he exclaimed suddenly if there aint the old chap comin' back ag'in
he looks as if he'd heard bad news from his sick family
by this time the pocketbook dropper had come up
approaching the boys he said in an undertone to dick give me back that pocketbook you young rascal
beg your pardon mister said dick but was you addressin' me
yes i was
'cause you called me by the wrong name
i've knowed some rascals but i aint the honor to belong to the family
he looked significantly at the other as he spoke which didn't improve the man's temper
accustomed to swindle others he did not fancy being practised upon in return
give me back that pocketbook he repeated in a threatening voice
couldn't do it said dick coolly
i'm go'n' to restore it to the owner
the contents is so valooable that most likely the loss has made him sick and he'll be likely to come down liberal to the honest finder
you gave me a bogus bill said the man
it's what i use myself said dick
you've swindled me
i thought it was the other way
none of your nonsense said the man angrily
if you don't give up that pocketbook i'll call a policeman
i wish you would said dick
they'll know most likely whether it's stewart or astor that's lost the pocketbook and i can get 'em to return it
the dropper whose object it was to recover the pocketbook in order to try the same game on a more satisfactory customer was irritated by dick's refusal and above all by the coolness he displayed
he resolved to make one more attempt
do you want to pass the night in the tombs
he asked
thank you for your very obligin' proposal said dick but it aint convenient today
any other time when you'd like to have me come and stop with you i'm agreeable but my two youngest children is down with the measles and i expect i'll have to set up all night to take care of 'em
is the tombs in gineral a pleasant place of residence
dick asked this question with an air of so much earnestness that frank could scarcely forbear laughing though it is hardly necessary to say that the dropper was by no means so inclined
you'll know sometime he said scowling
i'll make you a fair offer said dick
if i get more'n fifty dollars as a reward for my honesty i'll divide with you
but i say aint it most time to go back to your sick family in boston
finding that nothing was to be made out of dick the man strode away with a muttered curse
you were too smart for him dick said frank
yes said dick i aint knocked round the city streets all my life for nothin'
chapter viii  dick's early history   have you always lived in new york dick
asked frank after a pause
ever since i can remember
i wish you'd tell me a little about yourself
have you got any father or mother
i aint got no mother
she died when i wasn't but three years old
my father went to sea but he went off before mother died and nothin' was ever heard of him
i expect he got wrecked or died at sea
and what became of you when your mother died
the folks she boarded with took care of me but they was poor and they couldn't do much
when i was seven the woman died and her husband went out west and then i had to scratch for myself
at seven years old
exclaimed frank in amazement
yes said dick i was a little feller to take care of myself but he continued with pardonable pride i did it
what could you do
sometimes one thing and sometimes another said dick
i changed my business accordin' as i had to
sometimes i was a newsboy and diffused intelligence among the masses as i heard somebody say once in a big speech he made in the park
them was the times when horace greeley and james gordon bennett made money
through your enterprise
suggested frank
yes said dick but i give it up after a while
what for
well they didn't always put news enough in their papers and people wouldn't buy 'em as fast as i wanted 'em to
so one mornin' i was stuck on a lot of heralds and i thought i'd make a sensation
so i called out 'great news
queen victoria assassinated'
all my heralds went off like hot cakes and i went off too but one of the gentlemen what got sold remembered me and said he'd have me took up and that's what made me change my business
that wasn't right dick said frank
i know it said dick but lots of boys does it
that don't make it any better
no said dick i was sort of ashamed at the time 'specially about one poor old gentlemana englishman he was
he couldn't help cryin' to think the queen was dead and his hands shook when he handed me the money for the paper
what did you do next
i went into the match business said dick but it was small sales and small profits
most of the people i called on had just laid in a stock and didn't want to buy
so one cold night when i hadn't money enough to pay for a lodgin' i burned the last of my matches to keep me from freezin'
but it cost too much to get warm that way and i couldn't keep it up
you've seen hard times dick said frank compassionately
yes said dick i've knowed what it was to be hungry and cold with nothin' to eat or to warm me but there's one thing i never could do he added proudly
what's that
i never stole said dick
it's mean and i wouldn't do it
were you ever tempted to
lots of times
once i had been goin' round all day and hadn't sold any matches except three cents' worth early in the mornin'
with that i bought an apple thinkin' i should get some more bimeby
when evenin' come i was awful hungry
i went into a baker's just to look at the bread
it made me feel kind o' good just to look at the bread and cakes and i thought maybe they would give me some
i asked 'em wouldn't they give me a loaf and take their pay in matches
but they said they'd got enough matches to last three months so there wasn't any chance for a trade
while i was standin' at the stove warmin' me the baker went into a back room and i felt so hungry i thought i would take just one loaf and go off with it
there was such a big pile i don't think he'd have known it
but you didn't do it
no i didn't and i was glad of it for when the man came in ag'in he said he wanted some one to carry some cake to a lady in st mark's place
his boy was sick and he hadn't no one to send so he told me he'd give me ten cents if i would go
my business wasn't very pressin' just then so i went and when i come back i took my pay in bread and cakes
didn't they taste good though
so you didn't stay long in the match business dick
no i couldn't sell enough to make it pay
then there was some folks that wanted me to sell cheaper to them so i couldn't make any profit
there was one old ladyshe was rich too for she lived in a big brick housebeat me down so that i didn't make no profit at all but she wouldn't buy without and i hadn't sold none that day so i let her have them
i don't see why rich folks should be so hard upon a poor boy that wants to make a livin'
there's a good deal of meanness in the world i'm afraid dick
if everybody was like you and your uncle said dick there would be some chance for poor people
if i was rich i'd try to help 'em along
perhaps you will be rich sometime dick
dick shook his head
i'm afraid all my wallets will be like this said dick indicating the one he had received from the dropper and will be full of papers what aint of no use to anybody except the owner
that depends very much on yourself dick said frank
stewart wasn't always rich you know
wasn't he
when he first came to new york as a young man he was a teacher and teachers are not generally very rich
at last he went into business starting in a small way and worked his way up by degrees
but there was one thing he determined in the beginning that he would be strictly honorable in all his dealings and never overreach any one for the sake of making money
if there was a chance for him dick there is a chance for you
he knowed enough to be a teacher and i'm awful ignorant said dick
but you needn't stay so
how can i help it
can't you learn at school
i can't go to school 'cause i've got my livin' to earn
it wouldn't do me much good if i learned to read and write and just as i'd got learned i starved to death
but are there no nightschools
yes
why don't you go
i suppose you don't work in the evenings
i never cared much about it said dick and that's the truth
but since i've got to talkin' with you i think more about it
i guess i'll begin to go
i wish you would dick
you'll make a smart man if you only get a little education
do you think so
asked dick doubtfully
i know so
a boy who has earned his own living since he was seven years old must have something in him
i feel very much interested in you dick
you've had a hard time of it so far in life but i think better times are in store
i want you to do well and i feel sure you can if you only try
you're a good fellow said dick gratefully
i'm afraid i'm a pretty rough customer but i aint as bad as some
i mean to turn over a new leaf and try to grow up 'spectable
there've been a great many boys begin as low down as you dick that have grown up respectable and honored
but they had to work pretty hard for it
i'm willin' to work hard said dick
and you must not only work hard but work in the right way
what's the right way
you began in the right way when you determined never to steal or do anything mean or dishonorable however strongly tempted to do so
that will make people have confidence in you when they come to know you
but in order to succeed well you must manage to get as good an education as you can
until you do you cannot get a position in an office or countingroom even to run errands
that's so said dick soberly
i never thought how awful ignorant i was till now
that can be remedied with perseverance said frank
a year will do a great deal for you
i'll go to work and see what i can do said dick energetically
chapter ix  a scene in a third avenue car   the boys had turned into third avenue a long street which commencing just below the cooper institute runs out to harlem
a man came out of a side street uttering at intervals a monotonous cry which sounded like glass puddin'
glass pudding
repeated frank looking in surprised wonder at dick
what does he mean
perhaps you'd like some said dick
i never heard of it before
suppose you ask him what he charges for his puddin'
frank looked more narrowly at the man and soon concluded that he was a glazier
oh i understand he said
he means 'glass put in'
frank's mistake was not a singular one
the monotonous cry of these men certainly sounds more like glass puddin' than the words they intend to utter
now said dick where shall we go
i should like to see central park said frank
is it far off
it is about a mile and a half from here said dick
this is twentyninth street and the park begins at fiftyninth street
it may be explained for the benefit of readers who have never visited new york that about a mile from the city hall the crossstreets begin to be numbered in regular order
there is a continuous line of houses as far as one hundred and thirtieth street where may be found the terminus of the harlem line of horsecars
when the entire island is laid out and settled probably the numbers will reach two hundred or more
central park which lies between fiftyninth street on the south and one hundred and tenth street on the north is true to its name occupying about the centre of the island
the distance between two parallel streets is called a block and twenty blocks make a mile
it will therefore be seen that dick was exactly right when he said they were a mile and a half from central park
that is too far to walk said frank
'twon't cost but six cents to ride said dick
you mean in the horsecars
yes
all right then
we'll jump aboard the next car
the third avenue and harlem line of horsecars is better patronized than any other in new york though not much can be said for the cars which are usually dirty and overcrowded
still when it is considered that only seven cents are charged for the entire distance to harlem about seven miles from the city hall the fare can hardly be complained of
but of course most of the profit is made from the waypassengers who only ride a short distance
a car was at that moment approaching but it seemed pretty crowded
shall we take that or wait for another
asked frank
the next'll most likely be as bad said dick
the boys accordingly signalled to the conductor to stop and got on the front platform
they were obliged to stand up till the car reached fortieth street when so many of the passengers had got off that they obtained seats
frank sat down beside a middleaged woman or lady as she probably called herself whose sharp visage and thin lips did not seem to promise a very pleasant disposition
when the two gentlemen who sat beside her arose she spread her skirts in the endeavor to fill two seats
disregarding this the boys sat down
there aint room for two she said looking sourly at frank
there were two here before
well there ought not to have been
some people like to crowd in where they're not wanted
and some like to take up a double allowance of room thought frank but he did not say so
he saw that the woman had a bad temper and thought it wisest to say nothing
frank had never ridden up the city as far as this and it was with much interest that he looked out of the car windows at the stores on either side
third avenue is a broad street but in the character of its houses and stores it is quite inferior to broadway though better than some of the avenues further east
fifth avenue as most of my readers already know is the finest street in the city being lined with splendid private residences occupied by the wealthier classes
many of the cross streets also boast houses which may be considered palaces so elegant are they externally and internally
frank caught glimpses of some of these as he was carried towards the park
after the first conversation already mentioned with the lady at his side he supposed he should have nothing further to do with her
but in this he was mistaken
while he was busy looking out of the car window she plunged her hand into her pocket in search of her purse which she was unable to find
instantly she jumped to the conclusion that it had been stolen and her suspicions fastened upon frank with whom she was already provoked for crowding her as she termed it
conductor
she exclaimed in a sharp voice
what's wanted ma'am
returned that functionary
i want you to come here right off
what's the matter
my purse has been stolen
there was four dollars and eighty cents in it
i know because i counted it when i paid my fare
who stole it
that boy she said pointing to frank who listened to the charge in the most intense astonishment
he crowded in here on purpose to rob me and i want you to search him right off
that's a lie
exclaimed dick indignantly
oh you're in league with him i dare say said the woman spitefully
you're as bad as he is i'll be bound
you're a nice female you be
said dick ironically
don't you dare to call me a female sir said the lady furiously
why you aint a man in disguise be you
said dick
you are very much mistaken madam said frank quietly
the conductor may search me if you desire it
a charge of theft made in a crowded car of course made quite a sensation
cautious passengers instinctively put their hands on their pockets to make sure that they too had not been robbed
as for frank his face flushed and he felt very indignant that he should even be suspected of so mean a crime
he had been carefully brought up and been taught to regard stealing as low and wicked
dick on the contrary thought it a capital joke that such a charge should have been made against his companion
though he had brought himself up and known plenty of boys and men too who would steal he had never done so himself
he thought it mean
but he could not be expected to regard it as frank did
he had been too familiar with it in others to look upon it with horror
meanwhile the passengers rather sided with the boys
appearances go a great ways and frank did not look like a thief
i think you must be mistaken madam said a gentleman sitting opposite
the lad does not look as if he would steal
you can't tell by looks said the lady sourly
they're deceitful villains are generally well dressed
be they
said dick
you'd ought to see me with my washington coat on
you'd think i was the biggest villain ever you saw
i've no doubt you are said the lady scowling in the direction of our hero
thank you ma'am said dick
'tisn't often i get such fine compliments
none of your impudence said the lady wrathfully
i believe you're the worst of the two
meanwhile the car had been stopped
how long are we going to stop here
demanded a passenger impatiently
i'm in a hurry if none of the rest of you are
i want my pocketbook said the lady defiantly
well ma'am i haven't got it and i don't see as it's doing you any good detaining us all here
conductor will you call a policeman to search that young scamp
continued the aggrieved lady
you don't expect i'm going to lose my money and do nothing about it
i'll turn my pockets inside out if you want me to said frank proudly
there's no need of a policeman
the conductor or any one else may search me
well youngster said the conductor if the lady agrees i'll search you
the lady signified her assent
frank accordingly turned his pockets inside out but nothing was revealed except his own portemonnaie and a penknife
well ma'am are you satisfied
asked the conductor
no i aint said she decidedly
you don't think he's got it still
no but he's passed it over to his confederate that boy there that's so full of impudence
that's me said dick comically
he confesses it said the lady i want him searched
all right said dick i'm ready for the operation only as i've got valooable property about me be careful not to drop any of my erie bonds
the conductor's hand forthwith dove into dick's pocket and drew out a rusty jackknife a battered cent about fifty cents in change and the capacious pocketbook which he had received from the swindler who was anxious to get back to his sick family in boston
is that yours ma'am
asked the conductor holding up the wallet which excited some amazement by its size among the other passengers
it seems to me you carry a large pocketbook for a young man of your age said the conductor
that's what i carry my cash and valooable papers in said dick
i suppose that isn't yours ma'am said the conductor turning to the lady
no said she scornfully
i wouldn't carry round such a great wallet as that
most likely he's stolen it from somebody else
what a prime detective you'd be
said dick
p'rhaps you know who i took it from
i don't know but my money's in it said the lady sharply
conductor will you open that wallet and see what there is in it
don't disturb the valooable papers said dick in a tone of pretended anxiety
the contents of the wallet excited some amusement among the passengers
there don't seem to be much money here said the conductor taking out a roll of tissue paper cut out in the shape of bills and rolled up
no said dick
didn't i tell you them were papers of no valoo to anybody but the owner
if the lady'd like to borrow i won't charge no interest
where is my money then
said the lady in some discomfiture
i shouldn't wonder if one of the young scamps had thrown it out of the window
you'd better search your pocket once more said the gentleman opposite
i don't believe either of the boys is in fault
they don't look to me as if they would steal
thank you sir said frank
the lady followed out the suggestion and plunging her hand once more into her pocket drew out a small portemonnaie
she hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry at this discovery
it placed her in rather an awkward position after the fuss she had made and the detention to which she had subjected the passengers now as it proved for nothing
is that the pocketbook you thought stolen
asked the conductor
yes said she rather confusedly
then you've been keeping me waiting all this time for nothing he said sharply
i wish you'd take care to be sure next time before you make such a disturbance for nothing
i've lost five minutes and shall not be on time
i can't help it was the cross reply i didn't know it was in my pocket
it seems to me you owe an apology to the boys you accused of a theft which they have not committed said the gentleman opposite
i shan't apologize to anybody said the lady whose temper was not of the best least of all to such whippersnappers as they are
thank you ma'am said dick comically your handsome apology is accepted
it aint of no consequence only i didn't like to expose the contents of my valooable pocketbook for fear it might excite the envy of some of my poor neighbors
you're a character said the gentleman who had already spoken with a smile
a bad character
muttered the lady
but it was quite evident that the sympathies of those present were against the lady and on the side of the boys who had been falsely accused while dick's drollery had created considerable amusement
the cars had now reached fiftyninth street the southern boundary of the park and here our hero and his companion got off
you'd better look out for pickpockets my lad said the conductor pleasantly
that big wallet of yours might prove a great temptation
that's so said dick
that's the misfortin' of being rich
astor and me don't sleep much for fear of burglars breakin' in and robbin' us of our valooable treasures
sometimes i think i'll give all my money to an orphan asylum and take it out in board
i guess i'd make money by the operation
while dick was speaking the car rolled away and the boys turned up fiftyninth street for two long blocks yet separated them from the park
chapter x  introduces a victim of misplaced confidence   what a queer chap you are dick
said frank laughing
you always seem to be in good spirits
no i aint always
sometimes i have the blues
when
well once last winter it was awful cold and there was big holes in my shoes and my gloves and all my warm clothes was at the tailor's
i felt as if life was sort of tough and i'd like it if some rich man would adopt me and give me plenty to eat and drink and wear without my havin' to look so sharp after it
then agin' when i've seen boys with good homes and fathers and mothers i've thought i'd like to have somebody to care for me
dick's tone changed as he said this from his usual levity and there was a touch of sadness in it
frank blessed with a good home and indulgent parents could not help pitying the friendless boy who had found life such uphill work
don't say you have no one to care for you dick he said lightly laying his hand on dick's shoulder
i will care for you
will you
if you will let me
i wish you would said dick earnestly
i'd like to feel that i have one friend who cares for me
central park was now before them but it was far from presenting the appearance which it now exhibits
it had not been long since work had been commenced upon it and it was still very rough and unfinished
a rough tract of land two miles and a half from north to south and a half a mile broad very rocky in parts was the material from which the park commissioners have made the present beautiful enclosure
there were no houses of good appearance near it buildings being limited mainly to rude temporary huts used by the workmen who were employed in improving it
the time will undoubtedly come when the park will be surrounded by elegant residences and compare favorably in this respect with the most attractive parts of any city in the world
but at the time when frank and dick visited it not much could be said in favor either of the park or its neighborhood
if this is central park said frank who naturally felt disappointed i don't think much of it
my father's got a large pasture that is much nicer
it'll look better some time said dick
there aint much to see now but rocks
we will take a walk over it if you want to
no said frank i've seen as much of it as i want to
besides i feel tired
then we'll go back
we can take the sixth avenue cars
they will bring us out at vesey street just beside the astor house
all right said frank
that will be the best course
i hope he added laughing our agreeable lady friend won't be there
i don't care about being accused of stealing again
she was a tough one said dick
wouldn't she make a nice wife for a man that likes to live in hot water and didn't mind bein' scalded two or three times a day
yes i think she'd just suit him
is that the right car dick
yes jump in and i'll follow
the sixth avenue is lined with stores many of them of very good appearance and would make a very respectable principal street for a goodsized city
but it is only one of several long business streets which run up the island and illustrate the extent and importance of the city to which they belong
no incidents worth mentioning took place during their ride down town
in about threequarters of an hour the boys got out of the car beside the astor house
are you goin' in now frank
asked dick
that depends upon whether you have anything else to show me
wouldn't you like to go to wall street
that's the street where there are so many bankers and brokersisn't it
yes i s'pose you aint afraid of bulls and bearsare you
bulls and bears
repeated frank puzzled
yes
what are they
the bulls is what tries to make the stocks go up and the bears is what try to growl 'em down
oh i see
yes i'd like to go
accordingly they walked down on the west side of broadway as far as trinity church and then crossing entered a street not very wide or very long but of very great importance
the reader would be astonished if he could know the amount of money involved in the transactions which take place in a single day in this street
it would be found that although broadway is much greater in length and lined with stores it stands second to wall street in this respect
what is that large marble building
asked frank pointing to a massive structure on the corner of wall and nassau streets
it was in the form of a parallelogram two hundred feet long by ninety wide and about eighty feet in height the ascent to the entrance being by eighteen granite steps
that's the custom house said dick
it looks like pictures i've seen of the parthenon at athens said frank meditatively
where's athens
asked dick
it aint in york stateis it
not the athens i mean at any rate
it is in greece and was a famous city two thousand years ago
that's longer than i can remember said dick
i can't remember distinctly more'n about a thousand years
what a chap you are dick
do you know if we can go in
the boys ascertained after a little inquiry that they would be allowed to do so
they accordingly entered the custom house and made their way up to the roof from which they had a fine view of the harbor the wharves crowded with shipping and the neighboring shores of long island and new jersey
towards the north they looked down for many miles upon continuous lines of streets and thousands of roofs with here and there a churchspire rising above its neighbors
dick had never before been up there and he as well as frank was interested in the grand view spread before them
at length they descended and were going down the granite steps on the outside of the building when they were addressed by a young man whose appearance is worth describing
he was tall and rather loosely put together with small eyes and rather a prominent nose
his clothing had evidently not been furnished by a city tailor
he wore a blue coat with brass buttons and pantaloons of rather scanty dimensions which were several inches too short to cover his lower limbs
he held in his hand a piece of paper and his countenance wore a look of mingled bewilderment and anxiety
be they apayin' out money inside there
he asked indicating the interior by a motion of his hand
i guess so said dick
are you agoin' in for some
wal yes
i've got an order here for sixty dollarsmade a kind of speculation this morning
how was it
asked frank
wal you see i brought down some money to put in the bank fifty dollars it was and i hadn't justly made up my mind what bank to put it into when a chap came up in a terrible hurry and said it was very unfortunate but the bank wasn't open and he must have some money right off
he was obliged to go out of the city by the next train
i asked him how much he wanted
he said fifty dollars
i told him i'd got that and he offered me a check on the bank for sixty and i let him have it
i thought that was a pretty easy way to earn ten dollars so i counted out the money and he went off
he told me i'd hear a bell ring when they began to pay out money
but i've waited most two hours and i haint heard it yet
i'd ought to be goin' for i told dad i'd be home tonight
do you think i can get the money now
will you show me the check
asked frank who had listened attentively to the countryman's story and suspected that he had been made the victim of a swindler
it was made out upon the washington bank in the sum of sixty dollars and was signed ephraim smith
washington bank
repeated frank
dick is there such a bank in the city
not as i knows on said dick
leastways i don't own any shares in it
aint this the washington bank
asked the countryman pointing to the building on the steps of which the three were now standing
no it's the custom house
and won't they give me any money for this
asked the young man the perspiration standing on his brow
i am afraid the man who gave it to you was a swindler said frank gently
and won't i ever see my fifty dollars again
asked the youth in agony
i am afraid not
what'll dad say
ejaculated the miserable youth
it makes me feel sick to think of it
i wish i had the feller here
i'd shake him out of his boots
what did he look like
i'll call a policeman and you shall describe him
perhaps in that way you can get track of your money
dick called a policeman who listened to the description and recognized the operator as an experienced swindler
he assured the countryman that there was very little chance of his ever seeing his money again
the boys left the miserable youth loudly bewailing his bad luck and proceeded on their way down the street
he's a baby said dick contemptuously
he'd ought to know how to take care of himself and his money
a feller has to look sharp in this city or he'll lose his eyeteeth before he knows it
i suppose you never got swindled out of fifty dollars dick
no i don't carry no such small bills
i wish i did he added
so do i dick
what's that building there at the end of the street
that's the wallstreet ferry to brooklyn
how long does it take to go across
not more'n five minutes
suppose we just ride over and back
all right
said dick
it's rather expensive but if you don't mind i don't
why how much does it cost
two cents apiece
i guess i can stand that
let us go
they passed the gate paying the fare to a man who stood at the entrance and were soon on the ferryboat bound for brooklyn
they had scarcely entered the boat when dick grasping frank by the arm pointed to a man just outside of the gentlemen's cabin
do you see that man frank
he inquired
yes what of him
he's the man that cheated the country chap out of his fifty dollars
chapter xi  dick as a detective   dick's ready identification of the rogue who had cheated the countryman surprised frank
what makes you think it is he
he asked
because i've seen him before and i know he's up to them kind of tricks
when i heard how he looked i was sure i knowed him
our recognizing him won't be of much use said frank
it won't give back the countryman his money
i don't know said dick thoughtfully
may be i can get it
how
asked frank incredulously
wait a minute and you'll see
dick left his companion and went up to the man whom he suspected
ephraim smith said dick in a low voice
the man turned suddenly and looked at dick uneasily
what did you say
he asked
i believe your name is ephraim smith continued dick
you're mistaken said the man and was about to move off
stop a minute said dick
don't you keep your money in the washington bank
i don't know any such bank
i'm in a hurry young man and i can't stop to answer any foolish questions
the boat had by this time reached the brooklyn pier and mr ephraim smith seemed in a hurry to land
look here said dick significantly you'd better not go on shore unless you want to jump into the arms of a policeman
what do you mean
asked the man startled
that little affair of yours is known to the police said dick about how you got fifty dollars out of a greenhorn on a false check and it mayn't be safe for you to go ashore
i don't know what you're talking about said the swindler with affected boldness though dick could see that he was ill at ease
yes you do said dick
there isn't but one thing to do
just give me back that money and i'll see that you're not touched
if you don't i'll give you up to the first p'liceman we meet
dick looked so determined and spoke so confidently that the other overcome by his fears no longer hesitated but passed a roll of bills to dick and hastily left the boat
all this frank witnessed with great amazement not understanding what influence dick could have obtained over the swindler sufficient to compel restitution
how did you do it
he asked eagerly
i told him i'd exert my influence with the president to have him tried by habeas corpus said dick
and of course that frightened him
but tell me without joking how you managed
dick gave a truthful account of what occurred and then said now we'll go back and carry the money
suppose we don't find the poor countryman
then the p'lice will take care of it
they remained on board the boat and in five minutes were again in new york
going up wall street they met the countryman a little distance from the custom house
his face was marked with the traces of deep anguish but in his case even grief could not subdue the cravings of appetite
he had purchased some cakes of one of the old women who spread out for the benefit of passersby an array of apples and seedcakes and was munching them with melancholy satisfaction
hilloa
said dick
have you found your money
no ejaculated the young man with a convulsive gasp
i shan't ever see it again
the mean skunk's cheated me out of it
consarn his picter
it took me most six months to save it up
i was workin' for deacon pinkham in our place
oh i wish i'd never come to new york
the deacon he told me he'd keep it for me but i wanted to put it in the bank and now it's all gone boo hoo
and the miserable youth having despatched his cakes was so overcome by the thought of his loss that he burst into tears
i say said dick dry up and see what i've got here
the youth no sooner saw the roll of bills and comprehended that it was indeed his lost treasure than from the depths of anguish he was exalted to the most ecstatic joy
he seized dick's hand and shook it with so much energy that our hero began to feel rather alarmed for its safety
'pears to me you take my arm for a pumphandle said he
couldn't you show your gratitood some other way
it's just possible i may want to use my arm ag'in some time
the young man desisted but invited dick most cordially to come up and stop a week with him at his country home assuring him that he wouldn't charge him anything for board
all right
said dick
if you don't mind i'll bring my wife along too
she's delicate and the country air might do her good
jonathan stared at him in amazement uncertain whether to credit the fact of his marriage
dick walked on with frank leaving him in an apparent state of stupefaction and it is possible that he has not yet settled the affair to his satisfaction
now said frank i think i'll go back to the astor house
uncle has probably got through his business and returned
all right said dick
the two boys walked up to broadway just where the tall steeple of trinity faces the street of bankers and brokers and walked leisurely to the hotel
when they arrived at the astor house dick said goodby frank
not yet said frank i want you to come in with me
dick followed his young patron up the steps
frank went to the readingroom where as he had thought probable he found his uncle already arrived and reading a copy of the evening post which he had just purchased outside
well boys he said looking up have you had a pleasant jaunt
yes sir said frank
dick's a capital guide
so this is dick said mr whitney surveying him with a smile
upon my word i should hardly have known him
i must congratulate him on his improved appearance
frank's been very kind to me said dick who rough streetboy as he was had a heart easily touched by kindness of which he had never experienced much
he's a tiptop fellow
i believe he is a good boy said mr whitney
i hope my lad you will prosper and rise in the world
you know in this free country poverty in early life is no bar to a man's advancement
i haven't risen very high myself he added with a smile but have met with moderate success in life yet there was a time when i was as poor as you
were you sir asked dick eagerly
yes my boy i have known the time i have been obliged to go without my dinner because i didn't have enough money to pay for it
how did you get up in the world asked dick anxiously
i entered a printingoffice as an apprentice and worked for some years
then my eyes gave out and i was obliged to give that up
not knowing what else to do i went into the country and worked on a farm
after a while i was lucky enough to invent a machine which has brought me in a great deal of money
but there was one thing i got while i was in the printingoffice which i value more than money
what was that sir
a taste for reading and study
during my leisure hours i improved myself by study and acquired a large part of the knowledge which i now possess
indeed it was one of my books that first put me on the track of the invention which i afterwards made
so you see my lad that my studious habits paid me in money as well as in another way
i'm awful ignorant said dick soberly
but you are young and i judge a smart boy
if you try to learn you can and if you ever expect to do anything in the world you must know something of books
i will said dick resolutely
i aint always goin' to black boots for a livin'
all labor is respectable my lad and you have no cause to be ashamed of any honest business yet when you can get something to do that promises better for your future prospects i advise you to do so
till then earn your living in the way you are accustomed to avoid extravagance and save up a little money if you can
thank you for your advice said our hero
there aint many that takes an interest in ragged dick
so that's your name said mr whitney
if i judge you rightly it won't be long before you change it
save your money my lad buy books and determine to be somebody and you may yet fill an honorable position
i'll try said dick
goodnight sir
wait a minute dick said frank
your blackingbox and old clothes are upstairs
you may want them
in course said dick
i couldn't get along without my best clothes and my stock in trade
you may go up to the room with him frank said mr whitney
the clerk will give you the key
i want to see you dick before you go
yes sir said dick
where are you going to sleep tonight dick
asked frank as they went upstairs together
p'r'aps at the fifth avenue hotelon the outside said dick
haven't you any place to sleep then
i slept in a box last night
in a box
yes on spruce street
poor fellow
said frank compassionately
oh 'twas a bully bedfull of straw
i slept like a top
don't you earn enough to pay for a room dick
yes said dick only i spend my money foolish goin' to the old bowery and tony pastor's and sometimes gamblin' in baxter street
you won't gamble any morewill you dick
said frank laying his hand persuasively on his companion's shoulder
no i won't said dick
you'll promise
yes and i'll keep it
you're a good feller
i wish you was goin' to be in new york
i am going to a boardingschool in connecticut
the name of the town is barnton
will you write to me dick
my writing would look like hens' tracks said our hero
never mind
i want you to write
when you write you can tell me how to direct and i will send you a letter
i wish you would said dick
i wish i was more like you
i hope you will make a much better boy dick
now we'll go in to my uncle
he wishes to see you before you go
they went into the readingroom
dick had wrapped up his blackingbrush in a newspaper with which frank had supplied him feeling that a guest of the astor house should hardly be seen coming out of the hotel displaying such a professional sign
uncle dick's ready to go said frank
goodby my lad said mr whitney
i hope to hear good accounts of you sometime
don't forget what i have told you
remember that your future position depends mainly upon yourself and that it will be high or low as you choose to make it
he held out his hand in which was a fivedollar bill
dick shrunk back
i don't like to take it he said
i haven't earned it
perhaps not said mr whitney but i give it to you because i remember my own friendless youth
i hope it may be of service to you
sometime when you are a prosperous man you can repay it in the form of aid to some poor boy who is struggling upward as you are now
i will sir said dick manfully
he no longer refused the money but took it gratefully and bidding frank and his uncle goodby went out into the street
a feeling of loneliness came over him as he left the presence of frank for whom he had formed a strong attachment in the few hours he had known him
chapter xii  dick hires a room on mott street   going out into the fresh air dick felt the pangs of hunger
he accordingly went to a restaurant and got a substantial supper
perhaps it was the new clothes he wore which made him feel a little more aristocratic
at all events instead of patronizing the cheap restaurant where he usually procured his meals he went into the refectory attached to lovejoy's hotel where the prices were higher and the company more select
in his ordinary dress dick would have been excluded but now he had the appearance of a very respectable gentlemanly boy whose presence would not discredit any establishment
his orders were therefore received with attention by the waiter and in due time a good supper was placed before him
i wish i could come here every day thought dick
it seems kind o' nice and 'spectable side of the other place
there's a gent at that other table that i've shined boots for more'n once
he don't know me in my new clothes
guess he don't know his bootblack patronizes the same establishment
his supper over dick went up to the desk and presenting his check tendered in payment his fivedollar bill as if it were one of a large number which he possessed
receiving back his change he went out into the street
two questions now arose how should he spend the evening and where should he pass the night
yesterday with such a sum of money in his possession he would have answered both questions readily
for the evening he would have passed it at the old bowery and gone to sleep in any outoftheway place that offered
but he had turned over a new leaf or resolved to do so
he meant to save his money for some useful purposeto aid his advancement in the world
so he could not afford the theatre
besides with his new clothes he was unwilling to pass the night out of doors
i should spile 'em he thought and that wouldn't pay
so he determined to hunt up a room which he could occupy regularly and consider as his own where he could sleep nights instead of depending on boxes and old wagons for a chance shelter
this would be the first step towards respectability and dick determined to take it
he accordingly passed through the city hall park and walked leisurely up centre street
he decided that it would hardly be advisable for him to seek lodgings in fifth avenue although his present cash capital consisted of nearly five dollars in money besides the valuable papers contained in his wallet
besides he had reason to doubt whether any in his line of business lived on that aristocratic street
he took his way to mott street which is considerably less pretentious and halted in front of a shabby brick lodginghouse kept by a mrs mooney with whose son tom dick was acquainted
dick rang the bell which sent back a shrill metallic response
the door was opened by a slatternly servant who looked at him inquiringly and not without curiosity
it must be remembered that dick was well dressed and that nothing in his appearance bespoke his occupation
being naturally a goodlooking boy he might readily be mistaken for a gentleman's son
well queen victoria said dick is your missus at home
my name's bridget said the girl
oh indeed
said dick
you looked so much like the queen's picter what she gave me last christmas in exchange for mine that i couldn't help calling you by her name
oh go along wid ye
said bridget
it's makin' fun ye are
if you don't believe me said dick gravely all you've got to do is to ask my partic'lar friend the duke of newcastle
bridget
called a shrill voice from the basement
the missus is calling me said bridget hurriedly
i'll tell her ye want her
all right
said dick
the servant descended into the lower regions and in a short time a stout redfaced woman appeared on the scene
well sir what's your wish
she asked
have you got a room to let
asked dick
is it for yourself you ask
questioned the woman in some surprise
dick answered in the affirmative
i haven't got any very good rooms vacant
there's a small room in the third story
i'd like to see it said dick
i don't know as it would be good enough for you said the woman with a glance at dick's clothes
i aint very partic'lar about accommodations said our hero
i guess i'll look at it
dick followed the landlady up two narrow staircases uncarpeted and dirty to the third landing where he was ushered into a room about ten feet square
it could not be considered a very desirable apartment
it had once been covered with an oilcloth carpet but this was now very ragged and looked worse than none
there was a single bed in the corner covered with an indiscriminate heap of bedclothing rumpled and not overclean
there was a bureau with the veneering scratched and in some parts stripped off and a small glass eight inches by ten cracked across the middle also two chairs in rather a disjointed condition
judging from dick's appearance mrs mooney thought he would turn from it in disdain
but it must be remembered that dick's past experience had not been of a character to make him fastidious
in comparison with a box or an empty wagon even this little room seemed comfortable
he decided to hire it if the rent proved reasonable
well what's the tax
asked dick
i ought to have a dollar a week said mrs mooney hesitatingly
say seventyfive cents and i'll take it said dick
every week in advance
yes
well as times is hard and i can't afford to keep it empty you may have it
when will you come
tonight said dick
it aint lookin' very neat
i don't know as i can fix it up tonight
well i'll sleep here tonight and you can fix it up tomorrow
i hope you'll excuse the looks
i'm a lone woman and my help is so shiftless i have to look after everything myself so i can't keep things as straight as i want to
all right
said dick
can you pay me the first week in advance
asked the landlady cautiously
dick responded by drawing seventyfive cents from his pocket and placing it in her hand
what's your business sir if i may inquire
said mrs mooney
oh i'm professional
said dick
indeed
said the landlady who did not feel much enlightened by this answer
how's tom
asked dick
do you know my tom
said mrs mooney in surprise
he's gone to seato californy
he went last week
did he
said dick
yes i knew him
mrs mooney looked upon her new lodger with increased favor on finding that he was acquainted with her son who by the way was one of the worst young scamps in mott street which is saying considerable
i'll bring over my baggage from the astor house this evening said dick in a tone of importance
from the astor house
repeated mrs mooney in fresh amazement
yes i've been stoppin' there a short time with some friends said dick
mrs mooney might be excused for a little amazement at finding that a guest from the astor house was about to become one of her lodgerssuch transfers not being common
did you say you was purfessional
she asked
yes ma'am said dick politely
you aint aa mrs mooney paused uncertain what conjecture to hazard
oh no nothing of the sort said dick promptly
how could you think so mrs
mooney
no offence sir said the landlady more perplexed than ever
certainly not said our hero
but you must excuse me now mrs mooney as i have business of great importance to attend to
you'll come round this evening
dick answered in the affirmative and turned away
i wonder what he is
thought the landlady following him with her eyes as he crossed the street
he's got good clothes on but he don't seem very particular about his room
well i've got all my rooms full now
that's one comfort
dick felt more comfortable now that he had taken the decisive step of hiring a lodging and paying a week's rent in advance
for seven nights he was sure of a shelter and a bed to sleep in
the thought was a pleasant one to our young vagrant who hitherto had seldom known when he rose in the morning where he should find a restingplace at night
i must bring my traps round said dick to himself
i guess i'll go to bed early tonight
it'll feel kinder good to sleep in a reg'lar bed
boxes is rather hard to the back and aint comfortable in case of rain
i wonder what johnny nolan would say if he knew i'd got a room of my own
chapter xiii  micky maguire   about nine o'clock dick sought his new lodgings
in his hands he carried his professional wardrobe namely the clothes which he had worn at the commencement of the day and the implements of his business
these he stowed away in the bureau drawers and by the light of a flickering candle took off his clothes and went to bed
dick had a good digestion and a reasonably good conscience consequently he was a good sleeper
perhaps too the soft feather bed conduced to slumber
at any rate his eyes were soon closed and he did not awake until halfpast six the next morning
he lifted himself on his elbow and stared around him in transient bewilderment
blest if i hadn't forgot where i was he said to himself
so this is my room is it
well it seems kind of 'spectable to have a room and a bed to sleep in
i'd orter be able to afford seventyfive cents a week
i've throwed away more money than that in one evenin'
there aint no reason why i shouldn't live 'spectable
i wish i knowed as much as frank
he's a tiptop feller
nobody ever cared enough for me before to give me good advice
it was kicks and cuffs and swearin' at me all the time
i'd like to show him i can do something
while dick was indulging in these reflections he had risen from bed and finding an accession to the furniture of his room in the shape of an ancient washstand bearing a cracked bowl and broken pitcher indulged himself in the rather unusual ceremony of a good wash on the whole dick preferred to be clean but it was not always easy to gratify his desire
lodging in the street as he had been accustomed to do he had had no opportunity to perform his toilet in the customary manner
even now he found himself unable to arrange his dishevelled locks having neither comb nor brush
he determined to purchase a comb at least as soon as possible and a brush too if he could get one cheap
meanwhile he combed his hair with his fingers as well as he could though the result was not quite so satisfactory as it might have been
a question now came up for consideration
for the first time in his life dick possessed two suits of clothes
should he put on the clothes frank had given him or resume his old rags
now twentyfour hours before at the time dick was introduced to the reader's notice no one could have been less fastidious as to his clothing than he
indeed he had rather a contempt for good clothes or at least he thought so
but now as he surveyed the ragged and dirty coat and the patched pants dick felt ashamed of them
he was unwilling to appear in the streets with them
yet if he went to work in his new suit he was in danger of spoiling it and he might not have it in his power to purchase a new one
economy dictated a return to the old garments
dick tried them on and surveyed himself in the cracked glass but the reflection did not please him
they don't look 'spectable he decided and forthwith taking them off again he put on the new suit of the day before
i must try to earn a little more he thought to pay for my room and to buy some new clo'es when these is wore out
he opened the door of his chamber and went downstairs and into the street carrying his blackingbox with him
it was dick's custom to commence his business before breakfast generally it must be owned because he began the day penniless and must earn his meal before he ate it
today it was different
he had four dollars left in his pocketbook but this he had previously determined not to touch
in fact he had formed the ambitious design of starting an account at a savings' bank in order to have something to fall back upon in case of sickness or any other emergency or at any rate as a reserve fund to expend in clothing or other necessary articles when he required them
hitherto he had been content to live on from day to day without a penny ahead but the new vision of respectability which now floated before dick's mind owing to his recent acquaintance with frank was beginning to exercise a powerful effect upon him
in dick's profession as in others there are lucky days when everything seems to flow prosperously
as if to encourage him in his newborn resolution our hero obtained no less than six jobs in the course of an hour and a half
this gave him sixty cents quite abundant to purchase his breakfast and a comb besides
his exertions made him hungry and entering a small eatinghouse he ordered a cup of coffee and a beefsteak
to this he added a couple of rolls
this was quite a luxurious breakfast for dick and more expensive than he was accustomed to indulge himself with
to gratify the curiosity of my young readers i will put down the items with their cost    coffee 
              cts
beefsteak 
              a couple of rolls  
                                           cts
it will thus be seen that our hero had expended nearly onehalf of his morning's earnings
some days he had been compelled to breakfast on five cents and then he was forced to content himself with a couple of apples or cakes
but a good breakfast is a good preparation for a busy day and dick sallied forth from the restaurant lively and alert ready to do a good stroke of business
dick's change of costume was liable to lead to one result of which he had not thought
his brother bootblacks might think he had grown aristocratic and was putting on airsthat in fact he was getting above his business and desirous to outshine his associates
dick had not dreamed of this because in fact in spite of his newborn ambition he entertained no such feeling
there was nothing of what boys call bigfeeling about him
he was a borough democrat using the word not politically but in its proper sense and was disposed to fraternize with all whom he styled good fellows without regard to their position
it may seem a little unnecessary to some of my readers to make this explanation but they must remember that pride and bigfeeling are confined to no age or class but may be found in boys as well as men and in bootblacks as well as those of a higher rank
the morning being a busy time with the bootblacks dick's changed appearance had not as yet attracted much attention
but when business slackened a little our hero was destined to be reminded of it
among the downtown bootblacks was one hailing from the five pointsa stout redhaired freckledfaced boy of fourteen bearing the name of micky maguire
this boy by his boldness and recklessness as well as by his personal strength which was considerable had acquired an ascendancy among his fellow professionals and had a gang of subservient followers whom he led on to acts of ruffianism not unfrequently terminating in a month or two at blackwell's island
micky himself had served two terms there but the confinement appeared to have had very little effect in amending his conduct except perhaps in making him a little more cautious about an encounter with the copps as the members of the city police are for some unknown reason styled among the fivepoint boys
now micky was proud of his strength and of the position of leader which it had secured him
moreover he was democratic in his tastes and had a jealous hatred of those who wore good clothes and kept their faces clean
he called it putting on airs and resented the implied superiority
if he had been fifteen years older and had a trifle more education he would have interested himself in politics and been prominent at ward meetings and a terror to respectable voters on election day
as it was he contented himself with being the leader of a gang of young ruffians over whom he wielded a despotic power
now it is only justice to dick to say that so far as wearing good clothes was concerned he had never hitherto offended the eyes of micky maguire
indeed they generally looked as if they patronized the same clothing establishment
on this particular morning it chanced that micky had not been very fortunate in a business way and as a natural consequence his temper never very amiable was somewhat ruffled by the fact
he had had a very frugal breakfastnot because he felt abstemious but owing to the low state of his finances
he was walking along with one of his particular friends a boy nicknamed limpy jim so called from a slight peculiarity in his walk when all at once he espied our friend dick in his new suit
my eyes
he exclaimed in astonishment jim just look at ragged dick
he's come into a fortun' and turned gentleman
see his new clothes
so he has said jim
where'd he get 'em i wonder
hooked 'em p'raps
let's go and stir him up a little
we don't want no gentlemen on our beat
so he's puttin' on airsis he
i'll give him a lesson
so saying the two boys walked up to our hero who had not observed them his back being turned and micky maguire gave him a smart slap on the shoulder
dick turned round quickly
chapter xiv  a battle and a victory   what's that for
demanded dick turning round to see who had struck him
you're gettin' mighty fine
said micky maguire surveying dick's new clothes with a scornful air
there was something in his words and tone which dick who was disposed to stand up for his dignity did not at all relish
well what's the odds if i am
he retorted
does it hurt you any
see him put on airs jim said micky turning to his companion
where'd you get them clo'es
never mind where i got 'em
maybe the prince of wales gave 'em to me
hear him now jim said micky
most likely he stole 'em
stealin' aint in my line
it might have been unconscious the emphasis which dick placed on the word my
at any rate micky chose to take offence
do you mean to say i steal
he demanded doubling up his fist and advancing towards dick in a threatening manner
i don't say anything about it answered dick by no means alarmed at this hostile demonstration
i know you've been to the island twice
p'r'aps 'twas to make a visit along of the mayor and aldermen
maybe you was a innocent victim of oppression
i aint a goin' to say
micky's freckled face grew red with wrath for dick had only stated the truth
do you mean to insult me
he demanded shaking the fist already doubled up in dick's face
maybe you want a lickin'
i aint partic'larly anxious to get one said dick coolly
they don't agree with my constitution which is nat'rally delicate
i'd rather have a good dinner than a lickin' any time
you're afraid sneered micky
isn't he jim
in course he is
p'r'aps i am said dick composedly but it don't trouble me much
do you want to fight
demanded micky encouraged by dick's quietness fancying he was afraid to encounter him
no i don't said dick
i aint fond of fightin'
it's a very poor amusement and very bad for the complexion 'specially for the eyes and nose which is apt to turn red white and blue
micky misunderstood dick and judged from the tenor of his speech that he would be an easy victim
as he knew dick very seldom was concerned in any street fightnot from cowardice as he imagined but because he had too much good sense to do so
being quarrelsome like all bullies and supposing that he was more than a match for our hero being about two inches taller he could no longer resist an inclination to assault him and tried to plant a blow in dick's face which would have hurt him considerably if he had not drawn back just in time
now though dick was far from quarrelsome he was ready to defend himself on all occasions and it was too much to expect that he would stand quiet and allow himself to be beaten
he dropped his blackingbox on the instant and returned micky's blow with such good effect that the young bully staggered back and would have fallen if he had not been propped up by his confederate limpy jim
go in micky
shouted the latter who was rather a coward on his own account but liked to see others fight
polish him off that's a good feller
micky was now boiling over with rage and fury and required no urging
he was fully determined to make a terrible example of poor dick
he threw himself upon him and strove to bear him to the ground but dick avoiding a close hug in which he might possibly have got the worst of it by an adroit movement tripped up his antagonist and stretched him on the side walk
hit him jim
exclaimed micky furiously
limpy jim did not seem inclined to obey orders
there was a quiet strength and coolness about dick which alarmed him
he preferred that micky should incur all the risks of battle and accordingly set himself to raising his fallen comrade
come micky said dick quietly you'd better give it up
i wouldn't have touched you if you hadn't hit me first
i don't want to fight
it's low business
you're afraid of hurtin' your clo'es said micky with a sneer
maybe i am said dick
i hope i haven't hurt yours
micky's answer to this was another attack as violent and impetuous as the first
but his fury was in the way
he struck wildly not measuring his blows and dick had no difficulty in turning aside so that his antagonist's blow fell upon the empty air and his momentum was such that he nearly fell forward headlong
dick might readily have taken advantage of his unsteadiness and knocked him down but he was not vindictive and chose to act on the defensive except when he could not avoid it
recovering himself micky saw that dick was a more formidable antagonist than he had supposed and was meditating another assault better planned which by its impetuosity might bear our hero to the ground
but there was an unlookedfor interference
look out for the 'copp' said jim in a low voice
micky turned round and saw a tall policeman heading towards him and thought it might be prudent to suspend hostilities
he accordingly picked up his blackbox and hitching up his pants walked off attended by limpy jim
what's that chap been doing
asked the policeman of dick
he was amoosin' himself by pitchin' into me replied dick
what for
he didn't like it 'cause i patronized a different tailor from him
well it seems to me you are dressed pretty smart for a bootblack said the policeman
i wish i wasn't a bootblack said dick
never mind my lad
it's an honest business said the policeman who was a sensible man and a worthy citizen
it's an honest business
stick to it till you get something better
i mean to said dick
it aint easy to get out of it as the prisoner remarked when he was asked how he liked his residence
i hope you don't speak from experience
no said dick i don't mean to get into prison if i can help it
do you see that gentleman over there
asked the officer pointing to a welldressed man who was walking on the other side of the street
yes
well he was once a newsboy
and what is he now
he keeps a bookstore and is quite prosperous
dick looked at the gentleman with interest wondering if he should look as respectable when he was a grown man
it will be seen that dick was getting ambitious
hitherto he had thought very little of the future but was content to get along as he could dining as well as his means would allow and spending the evenings in the pit of the old bowery eating peanuts between the acts if he was prosperous and if unlucky supping on dry bread or an apple and sleeping in an old box or a wagon
now for the first time he began to reflect that he could not black boots all his life
in seven years he would be a man and since his meeting with frank he felt that he would like to be a respectable man
he could see and appreciate the difference between frank and such a boy as micky maguire and it was not strange that he preferred the society of the former
in the course of the next morning in pursuance of his new resolutions for the future he called at a savings bank and held out four dollars in bills besides another dollar in change
there was a high railing and a number of clerks busily writing at desks behind it
dick never having been in a bank before did not know where to go
he went by mistake to the desk where money was paid out
where's your book
asked the clerk
i haven't got any
have you any money deposited here
no sir i want to leave some here
then go to the next desk
dick followed directions and presented himself before an elderly man with gray hair who looked at him over the rims of his spectacles
i want you to keep that for me said dick awkwardly emptying his money out on the desk
how much is there
five dollars
have you got an account here
no sir
of course you can write
the of course was said on account of dick's neat dress
have i got to do any writing
asked our hero a little embarrassed
we want you to sign your name in this book and the old gentleman shoved round a large folio volume containing the names of depositors
dick surveyed the book with some awe
i aint much on writin' he said
very well write as well as you can
the pen was put into dick's hand and after dipping it in the inkstand he succeeded after a hard effort accompanied by many contortions of the face in inscribing upon the book of the bank the name  dick hunter
dickthat means richard i suppose said the bank officer who had some difficulty in making out the signature
no ragged dick is what folks call me
you don't look very ragged
no i've left my rags to home
they might get wore out if i used 'em too common
well my lad i'll make out a book in the name of dick hunter since you seem to prefer dick to richard
i hope you will save up your money and deposit more with us
our hero took his bankbook and gazed on the entry five dollars with a new sense of importance
he had been accustomed to joke about erie shares but now for the first time he felt himself a capitalist on a small scale to be sure but still it was no small thing for dick to have five dollars which he could call his own
he firmly determined that he would lay by every cent he could spare from his earnings towards the fund he hoped to accumulate
but dick was too sensible not to know that there was something more than money needed to win a respectable position in the world
he felt that he was very ignorant
of reading and writing he only knew the rudiments and that with a slight acquaintance with arithmetic was all he did know of books
dick knew he must study hard and he dreaded it
he looked upon learning as attended with greater difficulties than it really possesses
but dick had good pluck
he meant to learn nevertheless and resolved to buy a book with his first spare earnings
when dick went home at night he locked up his bankbook in one of the drawers of the bureau
it was wonderful how much more independent he felt whenever he reflected upon the contents of that drawer and with what an important air of joint ownership he regarded the bank building in which his small savings were deposited
chapter xv  dick secures a tutor   the next morning dick was unusually successful having plenty to do and receiving for one job twentyfive centsthe gentleman refusing to take change
then flashed upon dick's mind the thought that he had not yet returned the change due to the gentleman whose boots he had blacked on the morning of his introduction to the reader
what'll he think of me
said dick to himself
i hope he won't think i'm mean enough to keep the money
now dick was scrupulously honest and though the temptation to be otherwise had often been strong he had always resisted it
he was not willing on any account to keep money which did not belong to him and he immediately started for  fulton street the address which had been given him where he found mr greyson's name on the door of an office on the first floor
the door being open dick walked in
is mr greyson in
he asked of a clerk who sat on a high stool before a desk
not just now
he'll be in soon
will you wait
yes said dick
very well take a seat then
dick sat down and took up the morning tribune but presently came to a word of four syllables which he pronounced to himself a sticker and laid it down
but he had not long to wait for five minutes later mr greyson entered
did you wish to speak to me my lad
said he to dick whom in his new clothes he did not recognize
yes sir said dick
i owe you some money
indeed
said mr greyson pleasantly that's an agreeable surprise
i didn't know but you had come for some
so you are a debtor of mine and not a creditor
i b'lieve that's right said dick drawing fifteen cents from his pocket and placing in mr greyson's hand
fifteen cents
repeated he in some surprise
how do you happen to be indebted to me in that amount
you gave me a quarter for ashinin' your boots yesterday mornin' and couldn't wait for the change
i meant to have brought it before but i forgot all about it till this mornin'
it had quite slipped my mind also
but you don't look like the boy i employed
if i remember rightly he wasn't as well dressed as you
no said dick
i was dressed for a party then but the clo'es was too well ventilated to be comfortable in cold weather
you're an honest boy said mr greyson
who taught you to be honest
nobody said dick
but it's mean to cheat and steal
i've always knowed that
then you've got ahead of some of our business men
do you read the bible
no said dick
i've heard it's a good book but i don't know much about it
you ought to go to some sunday school
would you be willing
yes said dick promptly
i want to grow up 'spectable
but i don't know where to go
then i'll tell you
the church i attend is at the corner of fifth avenue and twentyfirst street
i've seen it said dick
i have a class in the sunday school there
if you'll come next sunday i'll take you into my class and do what i can to help you
thank you said dick but p'r'aps you'll get tired of teaching me
i'm awful ignorant
no my lad said mr greyson kindly
you evidently have some good principles to start with as you have shown by your scorn of dishonesty
i shall hope good things of you in the future
well dick said our hero apostrophizing himself as he left the office you're gettin' up in the world
you've got money invested and are goin' to attend church by partic'lar invitation on fifth avenue
i shouldn't wonder much if you should find cards when you get home from the mayor requestin' the honor of your company to dinner along with other distinguished guests
dick felt in very good spirits
he seemed to be emerging from the world in which he had hitherto lived into a new atmosphere of respectability and the change seemed very pleasant to him
at six o'clock dick went into a restaurant on chatham street and got a comfortable supper
he had been so successful during the day that after paying for this he still had ninety cents left
while he was despatching his supper another boy came in smaller and slighter than dick and sat down beside him
dick recognized him as a boy who three months before had entered the ranks of the bootblacks but who from a natural timidity had not been able to earn much
he was illfitted for the coarse companionship of the street boys and shrank from the rude jokes of his present associates
dick had never troubled him for our hero had a certain chivalrous feeling which would not allow him to bully or disturb a younger and weaker boy than himself
how are you fosdick
said dick as the other seated himself
pretty well said fosdick
i suppose you're all right
oh yes i'm right side up with care
i've been havin' a bully supper
what are you goin' to have
some bread and butter
why don't you get a cup o' coffee
why said fosdick reluctantly i haven't got money enough tonight
never mind said dick i'm in luck today i'll stand treat
that's kind in you said fosdick gratefully
oh never mind that said dick
accordingly he ordered a cup of coffee and a plate of beefsteak and was gratified to see that his young companion partook of both with evident relish
when the repast was over the boys went out into the street together dick pausing at the desk to settle for both suppers
where are you going to sleep tonight fosdick
asked dick as they stood on the sidewalk
i don't know said fosdick a little sadly
in some doorway i expect
but i'm afraid the police will find me out and make me move on
i'll tell you what said dick you must go home with me
i guess my bed will hold two
have you got a room
asked the other in surprise
yes said dick rather proudly and with a little excusable exultation
i've got a room over in mott street there i can receive my friends
that'll be better than sleepin' in a doorwaywon't it
yes indeed it will said fosdick
how lucky i was to come across you
it comes hard to me living as i do
when my father was alive i had every comfort
that's more'n i ever had said dick
but i'm goin' to try to live comfortable now
is your father dead
yes said fosdick sadly
he was a printer but he was drowned one dark night from a fulton ferryboat and as i had no relations in the city and no money i was obliged to go to work as quick as i could
but i don't get on very well
didn't you have no brothers nor sisters
asked dick
no said fosdick father and i used to live alone
he was always so much company to me that i feel very lonesome without him
there's a man out west somewhere that owes him two thousand dollars
he used to live in the city and father lent him all his money to help him go into business but he failed or pretended to and went off
if father hadn't lost that money he would have left me well off but no money would have made up his loss to me
what's the man's name that went off with your father's money
his name is hiram bates
p'r'aps you'll get the money again sometime
there isn't much chance of it said fosdick
i'd sell out my chances of that for five dollars
maybe i'll buy you out sometime said dick
now come round and see what sort of a room i've got
i used to go to the theatre evenings when i had money but now i'd rather go to bed early and have a good sleep
i don't care much about theatres said fosdick
father didn't use to let me go very often
he said it wasn't good for boys
i like to go to the old bowery sometimes
they have tiptop plays there
can you read and write well
he asked as a sudden thought came to him
yes said fosdick
father always kept me at school when he was alive and i stood pretty well in my classes
i was expecting to enter at the free academy next year
 now the college of the city of new york
then i'll tell you what said dick i'll make a bargain with you
i can't read much more'n a pig and my writin' looks like hens' tracks
i don't want to grow up knowin' no more'n a fouryearold boy
if you'll teach me readin' and writin' evenin's you shall sleep in my room every night
that'll be better'n doorsteps or old boxes where i've slept many a time
are you in earnest
said fosdick his face lighting up hopefully
in course i am said dick
it's fashionable for young gentlemen to have private tootors to introduct 'em into the flowerbeds of literatoor and science and why shouldn't i foller the fashion
you shall be my perfessor only you must promise not to be very hard if my writin' looks like a railfence on a bender
i'll try not to be too severe said fosdick laughing
i shall be thankful for such a chance to get a place to sleep
have you got anything to read out of
no said dick
my extensive and wellselected library was lost overboard in a storm when i was sailin' from the sandwich islands to the desert of sahara
but i'll buy a paper
that'll do me a long time
accordingly dick stopped at a paperstand and bought a copy of a weekly paper filled with the usual variety of reading matterstories sketches poems etc
they soon arrived at dick's lodginghouse
our hero procuring a lamp from the landlady led the way into his apartment which he entered with the proud air of a proprietor
well how do you like it fosdick
he asked complacently
the time was when fosdick would have thought it untidy and not particularly attractive
but he had served a severe apprenticeship in the streets and it was pleasant to feel himself under shelter and he was not disposed to be critical
it looks very comfortable dick he said
the bed aint very large said dick but i guess we can get along
oh yes said fosdick cheerfully
i don't take up much room
then that's all right
there's two chairs you see one for you and one for me
in case the mayor comes in to spend the evenin' socially he can sit on the bed
the boys seated themselves and five minutes later under the guidance of his young tutor dick had commenced his studies
chapter xvi  the first lesson   fortunately for dick his young tutor was well qualified to instruct him
henry fosdick though only twelve years old knew as much as many boys of fourteen
he had always been studious and ambitious to excel
his father being a printer employed in an office where books were printed often brought home new books in sheets which henry was always glad to read
mr fosdick had been besides a subscriber to the mechanics' apprentices' library which contains many thousands of wellselected and instructive books
thus henry had acquired an amount of general information unusual in a boy of his age
perhaps he had devoted too much time to study for he was not naturally robust
all this however fitted him admirably for the office to which dick had appointed himthat of his private instructor
the two boys drew up their chairs to the rickety table and spread out the paper before them
the exercises generally commence with ringin' the bell said dick but as i aint got none we'll have to do without
and the teacher is generally provided with a rod said fosdick
isn't there a poker handy that i can use in case my scholar doesn't behave well
'taint lawful to use firearms said dick
now dick said fosdick before we begin i must find out how much you already know
can you read any
not enough to hurt me said dick
all i know about readin' you could put in a nutshell and there'd be room left for a small family
i suppose you know your letters
yes said dick i know 'em all but not intimately
i guess i can call 'em all by name
where did you learn them
did you ever go to school
yes i went two days
why did you stop
it didn't agree with my constitution
you don't look very delicate said fosdick
no said dick i aint troubled much that way but i found lickins didn't agree with me
did you get punished
awful said dick
what for
for indulgin' in a little harmless amoosement said dick
you see the boy that was sittin' next to me fell asleep which i considered improper in schooltime so i thought i'd help the teacher a little by wakin' him up
so i took a pin and stuck into him but i guess it went a little too far for he screeched awful
the teacher found out what it was that made him holler and whipped me with a ruler till i was black and blue
i thought 'twas about time to take a vacation so that's the last time i went to school
you didn't learn to read in that time of course
no said dick but i was a newsboy a little while so i learned a little just so's to find out what the news was
sometimes i didn't read straight and called the wrong news
one mornin' i asked another boy what the paper said and he told me the king of africa was dead
i thought it was all right till folks began to laugh
well dick if you'll only study well you won't be liable to make such mistakes
i hope so said dick
my friend horace greeley told me the other day that he'd get me to take his place now and then when he was off makin' speeches if my edication hadn't been neglected
i must find a good piece for you to begin on said fosdick looking over the paper
find an easy one said dick with words of one story
fosdick at length found a piece which he thought would answer
he discovered on trial that dick had not exaggerated his deficiencies
words of two syllables he seldom pronounced right and was much surprised when he was told how through was sounded
seems to me it's throwin' away letters to use all them he said
how would you spell it
asked his young teacher
thru said dick
well said fosdick there's a good many other words that are spelt with more letters than they need to have
but it's the fashion and we must follow it
but if dick was ignorant he was quick and had an excellent capacity
moreover he had perseverance and was not easily discouraged
he had made up his mind he must know more and was not disposed to complain of the difficulty of his task
fosdick had occasion to laugh more than once at his ludicrous mistakes but dick laughed too and on the whole both were quite interested in the lesson
at the end of an hour and a half the boys stopped for the evening
you're learning fast dick said fosdick
at this rate you will soon learn to read well
will i
asked dick with an expression of satisfaction
i'm glad of that
i don't want to be ignorant
i didn't use to care but i do now
i want to grow up 'spectable
so do i dick
we will both help each other and i am sure we can accomplish something
but i am beginning to feel sleepy
so am i said dick
them hard words make my head ache
i wonder who made 'em all
that's more than i can tell
i suppose you've seen a dictionary
that's another of 'em
no i can't say i have though i may have seen him in the street without knowin' him
a dictionary is a book containing all the words in the language
how many are there
i don't rightly know but i think there are about fifty thousand
it's a pretty large family said dick
have i got to learn 'em all
that will not be necessary
there are a large number which you would never find occasion to use
i'm glad of that said dick for i don't expect to live to be more'n a hundred and by that time i wouldn't be more'n half through
by this time the flickering lamp gave a decided hint to the boys that unless they made haste they would have to undress in the dark
they accordingly drew off their clothes and dick jumped into bed
but fosdick before doing so knelt down by the side of the bed and said a short prayer
what's that for
asked dick curiously
i was saying my prayers said fosdick as he rose from his knees
don't you ever do it
no said dick
nobody ever taught me
then i'll teach you
shall i
i don't know said dick dubiously
what's the good
fosdick explained as well as he could and perhaps his simple explanation was better adapted to dick's comprehension than one from an older person would have been
dick felt more free to ask questions and the example of his new friend for whom he was beginning to feel a warm attachment had considerable effect upon him
when therefore fosdick asked again if he should teach him a prayer dick consented and his young bedfellow did so
dick was not naturally irreligious
if he had lived without a knowledge of god and of religious things it was scarcely to be wondered at in a lad who from an early age had been thrown upon his own exertions for the means of living with no one to care for him or give him good advice
but he was so far good that he could appreciate goodness in others and this it was that had drawn him to frank in the first place and now to henry fosdick
he did not therefore attempt to ridicule his companion as some boys better brought up might have done but was willing to follow his example in what something told him was right
our young hero had taken an important step toward securing that genuine respectability which he was ambitious to attain
weary with the day's work and dick perhaps still more fatigued by the unusual mental effort he had made the boys soon sank into a deep and peaceful slumber from which they did not awaken till six o'clock the next morning
before going out dick sought mrs mooney and spoke to her on the subject of taking fosdick as a roommate
he found that she had no objection provided he would allow her twentyfive cents a week extra in consideration of the extra trouble which his companion might be expected to make
to this dick assented and the arrangement was definitely concluded
this over the two boys went out and took stations near each other
dick had more of a business turn than henry and less shrinking from publicity so that his earnings were greater
but he had undertaken to pay the entire expenses of the room and needed to earn more
sometimes when two customers presented themselves at the same time he was able to direct one to his friend
so at the end of the week both boys found themselves with surplus earnings
dick had the satisfaction of adding two dollars and a half to his deposits in the savings bank and fosdick commenced an account by depositing seventyfive cents
on sunday morning dick bethought himself of his promise to mr greyson to come to the church on fifth avenue
to tell the truth dick recalled it with some regret
he had never been inside a church since he could remember and he was not much attracted by the invitation he had received
but henry finding him wavering urged him to go and offered to go with him
dick gladly accepted the offer feeling that he required someone to lend him countenance under such unusual circumstances
dick dressed himself with scrupulous care giving his shoes a shine so brilliant that it did him great credit in a professional point of view and endeavored to clean his hands thoroughly but in spite of all he could do they were not so white as if his business had been of a different character
having fully completed his preparations he descended into the street and with henry by his side crossed over to broadway
the boys pursued their way up broadway which on sunday presents a striking contrast in its quietness to the noise and confusion of ordinary weekdays as far as union square then turned down fourteenth street which brought them to fifth avenue
suppose we dine at delmonico's said fosdick looking towards that famous restaurant
i'd have to sell some of my erie shares said dick
a short walk now brought them to the church of which mention has already been made
they stood outside a little abashed watching the fashionably attired people who were entering and were feeling a little undecided as to whether they had better enter also when dick felt a light touch upon his shoulder
turning round he met the smiling glance of mr greyson
so my young friend you have kept your promise he said
and whom have you brought with you
a friend of mine said dick
his name is henry fosdick
i am glad you have brought him
now follow me and i will give you seats
chapter xvii  dick's first appearance in society   it was the hour for morning service
the boys followed mr greyson into the handsome church and were assigned seats in his own pew
there were two persons already seated in ita goodlooking lady of middle age and a pretty little girl of nine
they were mrs greyson and her only daughter ida
they looked pleasantly at the boys as they entered smiling a welcome to them
the morning service commenced
it must be acknowledged that dick felt rather awkward
it was an unusual place for him and it need not be wondered at that he felt like a cat in a strange garret
he would not have known when to rise if he had not taken notice of what the rest of the audience did and followed their example
he was sitting next to ida and as it was the first time he had ever been near so welldressed a young lady he naturally felt bashful
when the hymns were announced ida found the place and offered a hymnbook to our hero
dick took it awkwardly but his studies had not yet been pursued far enough for him to read the words readily
however he resolved to keep up appearances and kept his eyes fixed steadily on the hymnbook
at length the service was over
the people began to file slowly out of church and among them of course mr greyson's family and the two boys
it seemed very strange to dick to find himself in such different companionship from what he had been accustomed and he could not help thinking wonder what johnny nolan 'ould say if he could see me now
but johnny's business engagements did not often summon him to fifth avenue and dick was not likely to be seen by any of his friends in the lower part of the city
we have our sunday school in the afternoon said mr greyson
i suppose you live at some distance from here
in mott street sir answered dick
that is too far to go and return
suppose you and your friend come and dine with us and then we can come here together in the afternoon
dick was as much astonished at this invitation as if he had really been invited by the mayor to dine with him and the board of aldermen
mr greyson was evidently a rich man and yet he had actually invited two bootblacks to dine with him
i guess we'd better go home sir said dick hesitating
i don't think you can have any very pressing engagements to interfere with your accepting my invitation said mr greyson goodhumoredly for he understood the reason of dick's hesitation
so i take it for granted that you both accept
before dick fairly knew what he intended to do he was walking down fifth avenue with his new friends
now our young hero was not naturally bashful but he certainly felt so now especially as miss ida greyson chose to walk by his side leaving henry fosdick to walk with her father and mother
what is your name
asked ida pleasantly
our hero was about to answer ragged dick when it occurred to him that in the present company he had better forget his old nickname
dick hunter he answered
dick
repeated ida
that means richard doesn't it
everybody calls me dick
i have a cousin dick said the young lady sociably
his name is dick wilson
i suppose you don't know him
no said dick
i like the name of dick said the young lady with charming frankness
without being able to tell why dick felt rather glad she did
he plucked up courage to ask her name
my name is ida answered the young lady
do you like it
yes said dick
it's a bully name
dick turned red as soon as he had said it for he felt that he had not used the right expression
the little girl broke into a silvery laugh
what a funny boy you are
she said
i didn't mean it said dick stammering
i meant it's a tiptop name
here ida laughed again and dick wished himself back in mott street
how old are you
inquired ida continuing her examination
i'm fourteengoin' on fifteen said dick
you're a big boy of your age said ida
my cousin dick is a year older than you but he isn't as large
dick looked pleased
boys generally like to be told that they are large of their age
how old be you
asked dick beginning to feel more at his ease
i'm nine years old said ida
i go to miss jarvis's school
i've just begun to learn french
do you know french
not enough to hurt me said dick
ida laughed again and told him that he was a droll boy
do you like it
asked dick
i like it pretty well except the verbs
i can't remember them well
do you go to school
i'm studying with a private tutor said dick
are you
so is my cousin dick
he's going to college this year
are you going to college
not this year
because if you did you know you'd be in the same class with my cousin
it would be funny to have two dicks in one class
they turned down twentyfourth street passing the fifth avenue hotel on the left and stopped before an elegant house with a brown stone front
the bell was rung and the door being opened the boys somewhat abashed followed mr greyson into a handsome hall
they were told where to hang their hats and a moment afterwards were ushered into a comfortable diningroom where a table was spread for dinner
dick took his seat on the edge of a sofa and was tempted to rub his eyes to make sure that he was really awake
he could hardly believe that he was a guest in so fine a mansion
ida helped to put the boys at their ease
do you like pictures
she asked
very much answered henry
the little girl brought a book of handsome engravings and seating herself beside dick to whom she seemed to have taken a decided fancy commenced showing them to him
there are the pyramids of egypt she said pointing to one engraving
what are they for
asked dick puzzled
i don't see any winders
no said ida i don't believe anybody lives there
do they papa
no my dear
they were used for the burial of the dead
the largest of them is said to be the loftiest building in the world with one exception
the spire of the cathedral of strasburg is twentyfour feet higher if i remember rightly
is egypt near here
asked dick
oh no it's ever so many miles off about four or five hundred
didn't you know
no said dick
i never heard
you don't appear to be very accurate in your information ida said her mother
four or five thousand miles would be considerably nearer the truth
after a little more conversation they sat down to dinner
dick seated himself in an embarrassed way
he was very much afraid of doing or saying something which would be considered an impropriety and had the uncomfortable feeling that everybody was looking at him and watching his behavior
where do you live dick
asked ida familiarly
in mott street
where is that
more than a mile off
is it a nice street
not very said dick
only poor folks live there
are you poor
little girls should be seen and not heard said her mother gently
if you are said ida i'll give you the fivedollar goldpiece aunt gave me for a birthday present
dick cannot be called poor my child said mrs greyson since he earns his living by his own exertions
do you earn your living
asked ida who was a very inquisitive young lady and not easily silenced
what do you do
dick blushed violently
at such a table and in presence of the servant who was standing at that moment behind his chair he did not like to say that he was a shoeblack although he well knew that there was nothing dishonorable in the occupation
mr greyson perceived his feelings and to spare them said you are too inquisitive ida
sometime dick may tell you but you know we don't talk of business on sundays
dick in his embarrassment had swallowed a large spoonful of hot soup which made him turn red in the face
for the second time in spite of the prospect of the best dinner he had ever eaten he wished himself back in mott street
henry fosdick was more easy and unembarrassed than dick not having led such a vagabond and neglected life
but it was to dick that ida chiefly directed her conversation having apparently taken a fancy to his frank and handsome face
i believe i have already said that dick was a very goodlooking boy especially now since he kept his face clean
he had a frank honest expression which generally won its way to the favor of those with whom he came in contact
dick got along pretty well at the table by dint of noticing how the rest acted but there was one thing he could not manage eating with his fork which by the way he thought a very singular arrangement
at length they arose from the table somewhat to dick's relief
again ida devoted herself to the boys and exhibited a profusely illustrated bible for their entertainment
dick was interested in looking at the pictures though he knew very little of their subjects
henry fosdick was much better informed as might have been expected
when the boys were about to leave the house with mr greyson for the sunday school ida placed her hand in dick's and said persuasively you'll come again dick won't you
thank you said dick i'd like to and he could not help thinking ida the nicest girl he had ever seen
yes said mrs greyson hospitably we shall be glad to see you both here again
thank you very much said henry fosdick gratefully
we shall like very much to come
i will not dwell upon the hour spent in sunday school nor upon the remarks of mr greyson to his class
he found dick's ignorance of religious subjects so great that he was obliged to begin at the beginning with him
dick was interested in hearing the children sing and readily promised to come again the next sunday
when the service was over dick and henry walked homewards
dick could not help letting his thoughts rest on the sweet little girl who had given him so cordial a welcome and hoping that he might meet her again
mr greyson is a nice manisn't he dick
asked henry as they were turning into mott street and were already in sight of their lodginghouse
aint he though
said dick
he treated us just as if we were young gentlemen
ida seemed to take a great fancy to you
she's a tiptop girl said dick but she asked so many questions that i didn't know what to say
he had scarcely finished speaking when a stone whizzed by his head and turning quickly he saw micky maguire running round the corner of the street which they had just passed
chapter xviii  micky maguire's second defeat   dick was no coward
nor was he in the habit of submitting passively to an insult
when therefore he recognized micky as his assailant he instantly turned and gave chase
micky anticipated pursuit and ran at his utmost speed
it is doubtful if dick would have overtaken him but micky had the ill luck to trip just as he had entered a narrow alley and falling with some violence received a sharp blow from the hard stones which made him scream with pain
ow
he whined
don't you hit a feller when he's down
what made you fire that stone at me
demanded our hero looking down at the fallen bully
just for fun said micky
it would have been a very agreeable s'prise if it had hit me said dick
s'posin' i fire a rock at you jest for fun
don't
exclaimed micky in alarm
it seems you don't like agreeable s'prises said dick any more'n the man did what got hooked by a cow one mornin' before breakfast
it didn't improve his appetite much
i've most broke my arm said micky ruefully rubbing the affected limb
if it's broke you can't fire no more stones which is a very cheerin' reflection said dick
ef you haven't money enough to buy a wooden one i'll lend you a quarter
there's one good thing about wooden ones they aint liable to get cold in winter which is another cheerin' reflection
i don't want none of yer cheerin' reflections said micky sullenly
yer company aint wanted here
thank you for your polite invitation to leave said dick bowing ceremoniously
i'm willin' to go but ef you throw any more stones at me micky maguire i'll hurt you worse than the stones did
the only answer made to this warning was a scowl from his fallen opponent
it was quite evident that dick had the best of it and he thought it prudent to say nothing
as i've got a friend waitin' outside i shall have to tear myself away said dick
you'd better not throw any more stones micky maguire for it don't seem to agree with your constitution
micky muttered something which dick did not stay to hear
he backed out of the alley keeping a watchful eye on his fallen foe and rejoined henry fosdick who was awaiting his return
who was it dick
he asked
a partic'lar friend of mine micky maguire said dick
he playfully fired a rock at my head as a mark of his 'fection
he loves me like a brother micky does
rather a dangerous kind of a friend i should think said fosdick
he might have killed you
i've warned him not to be so 'fectionate another time said dick
i know him said henry fosdick
he's at the head of a gang of boys living at the fivepoints
he threatened to whip me once because a gentleman employed me to black his boots instead of him
he's been at the island two or three times for stealing said dick
i guess he won't touch me again
he'd rather get hold of small boys
if he ever does anything to you fosdick just let me know and i'll give him a thrashing
dick was right
micky maguire was a bully and like most bullies did not fancy tackling boys whose strength was equal or superior to his own
although he hated dick more than ever because he thought our hero was putting on airs he had too lively a remembrance of his strength and courage to venture upon another open attack
he contented himself therefore whenever he met dick with scowling at him
dick took this very philosophically remarking that if it was soothin' to micky's feelings he might go ahead as it didn't hurt him much
it will not be necessary to chronicle the events of the next few weeks
a new life had commenced for dick
he no longer haunted the gallery of the old bowery and even tony pastor's hospitable doors had lost their old attractions
he spent two hours every evening in study
his progress was astonishingly rapid
he was gifted with a natural quickness and he was stimulated by the desire to acquire a fair education as a means of growin' up 'spectable as he termed it
much was due also to the patience and perseverance of henry fosdick who made a capital teacher
you're improving wonderfully dick said his friend one evening when dick had read an entire paragraph without a mistake
am i
said dick with satisfaction
yes
if you'll buy a writingbook tomorrow we can begin writing tomorrow evening
what else do you know henry
asked dick
arithmetic and geography and grammar
what a lot you know
said dick admiringly
i don't know any of them said fosdick
i've only studied them
i wish i knew a great deal more
i'll be satisfied when i know as much as you said dick
it seems a great deal to you now dick but in a few months you'll think differently
the more you know the more you'll want to know
then there aint any end to learnin'
said dick
no
well said dick i guess i'll be as much as sixty before i know everything
yes as old as that probably said fosdick laughing
anyway you know too much to be blackin' boots
leave that to ignorant chaps like me
you won't be ignorant long dick
you'd ought to get into some office or countin'room
i wish i could said fosdick earnestly
i don't succeed very well at blacking boots
you make a great deal more than i do
that's cause i aint troubled with bashfulness said dick
bashfulness aint as natural to me as it is to you
i'm always on hand as the cat said to the milk
you'd better give up shines fosdick and give your 'tention to mercantile pursuits
i've thought of trying to get a place said fosdick but no one would take me with these clothes and he directed his glance to his wellworn suit which he kept as neat as he could but which in spite of all his care began to show decided marks of use
there was also here and there a stain of blacking upon it which though an advertisement of his profession scarcely added to its good appearance
i almost wanted to stay at home from sunday school last sunday he continued because i thought everybody would notice how dirty and worn my clothes had got to be
if my clothes wasn't two sizes too big for you said dick generously i'd change
you'd look as if you'd got into your greatuncle's suit by mistake
you're very kind dick to think of changing said fosdick for your suit is much better than mine but i don't think that mine would suit you very well
the pants would show a little more of your ankles than is the fashion and you couldn't eat a very hearty dinner without bursting the buttons off the vest
that wouldn't be very convenient said dick
i aint fond of lacin' to show my elegant figger
but i say he added with a sudden thought how much money have we got in the savings' bank
fosdick took a key from his pocket and went to the drawer in which the bankbooks were kept and opening it brought them out for inspection
it was found that dick had the sum of eighteen dollars and ninety cents placed to his credit while fosdick had six dollars and fortyfive cents
to explain the large difference it must be remembered that dick had deposited five dollars before henry deposited anything being the amount he had received as a gift from mr whitney
how much does that make the lot of it
asked dick
i aint much on figgers yet you know
it makes twentyfive dollars and thirtyfive cents dick said his companion who did not understand the thought which suggested the question
take it and buy some clothes henry said dick shortly
what your money too
in course
no dick you are too generous
i couldn't think of it
almost threequarters of the money is yours
you must spend it on yourself
i don't need it said dick
you may not need it now but you will some time
i shall have some more then
that may be but it wouldn't be fair for me to use your money dick
i thank you all the same for your kindness
well i'll lend it to you then persisted dick and you can pay me when you get to be a rich merchant
but it isn't likely i ever shall be one
how d'you know
i went to a fortun' teller once and she told me i was born under a lucky star with a hard name and i should have a rich man for my particular friend who would make my fortun'
i guess you are going to be the rich man
fosdick laughed and steadily refused for some time to avail himself of dick's generous proposal but at length perceiving that our hero seemed much disappointed and would be really glad if his offer were accepted he agreed to use as much as might be needful
this at once brought back dick's goodhumor and he entered with great enthusiasm into his friend's plans
the next day they withdrew the money from the bank and when business got a little slack in the afternoon set out in search of a clothing store
dick knew enough of the city to be able to find a place where a good bargain could be obtained
he was determined that fosdick should have a good serviceable suit even if it took all the money they had
the result of their search was that for twentythree dollars fosdick obtained a very neat outfit including a couple of shirts a hat and a pair of shoes besides a dark mixed suit which appeared stout and of good quality
shall i send the bundle home
asked the salesman impressed by the offhand manner in which dick drew out the money in payment for the clothes
thank you said dick you're very kind but i'll take it home myself and you can allow me something for my trouble
all right said the clerk laughing i'll allow it on your next purchase
proceeding to their apartment in mott street fosdick at once tried on his new suit and it was found to be an excellent fit
dick surveyed his new friend with much satisfaction
you look like a young gentleman of fortun' he said and do credit to your governor
i suppose that means you dick said fosdick laughing
in course it does
you should say of course said fosdick who in virtue of his position as dick's tutor ventured to correct his language from time to time
how dare you correct your gov'nor
said dick with comic indignation
'i'll cut you off with a shillin' you young dog' as the markis says to his nephew in the play at the old bowery
chapter xix  fosdick changes his business   fosdick did not venture to wear his new clothes while engaged in his business
this he felt would have been wasteful extravagance
about ten o'clock in the morning when business slackened he went home and dressing himself went to a hotel where he could see copies of the morning herald and sun and noting down the places where a boy was wanted went on a round of applications
but he found it no easy thing to obtain a place
swarms of boys seemed to be out of employment and it was not unusual to find from fifty to a hundred applicants for a single place
there was another difficulty
it was generally desired that the boy wanted should reside with his parents
when fosdick on being questioned revealed the fact of his having no parents and being a boy of the street this was generally sufficient of itself to insure a refusal
merchants were afraid to trust one who had led such a vagabond life
dick who was always ready for an emergency suggested borrowing a white wig and passing himself off for fosdick's father or grandfather
but henry thought this might be rather a difficult character for our hero to sustain
after fifty applications and as many failures fosdick began to get discouraged
there seemed to be no way out of his present business for which he felt unfitted
i don't know but i shall have to black boots all my life he said one day despondently to dick
keep a stiff upper lip said dick
by the time you get to be a grayheaded veteran you may get a chance to run errands for some big firm on the bowery which is a very cheerin' reflection
so dick by his drollery and perpetual good spirits kept up fosdick's courage
as for me said dick i expect by that time to lay up a colossal fortun' out of shines and live in princely style on the avenoo
but one morning fosdick straying into french's hotel discovered the following advertisement in the columns of the herald  wanteda smart capable boy to run errands and make himself generally useful in a hat and cap store
salary three dollars a week at first
inquire at no
 broadway after ten o'clock am  he determined to make application and as the city hall clock just then struck the hour indicated lost no time in proceeding to the store which was only a few blocks distant from the astor house
it was easy to find the store as from a dozen to twenty boys were already assembled in front of it
they surveyed each other askance feeling that they were rivals and mentally calculating each other's chances
there isn't much chance for me said fosdick to dick who had accompanied him
look at all these boys
most of them have good homes i suppose and good recommendations while i have nobody to refer to
go ahead said dick
your chance is as good as anybody's
while this was passing between dick and his companion one of the boys a rather superciliouslooking young gentleman genteelly dressed and evidently having a very high opinion of his dress and himself turned suddenly to dick and remarked  i've seen you before
oh have you
said dick whirling round then p'r'aps you'd like to see me behind
at this unexpected answer all the boys burst into a laugh with the exception of the questioner who evidently considered that dick had been disrespectful
i've seen you somewhere he said in a surly tone correcting himself
most likely you have said dick
that's where i generally keep myself
there was another laugh at the expense of roswell crawford for that was the name of the young aristocrat
but he had his revenge ready
no boy relishes being an object of ridicule and it was with a feeling of satisfaction that he retorted  i know you for all your impudence
you're nothing but a bootblack
this information took the boys who were standing around by surprise for dick was welldressed and had none of the implements of his profession with him
s'pose i be said dick
have you got any objection
not at all said roswell curling his lip only you'd better stick to blacking boots and not try to get into a store
thank you for your kind advice said dick
is it gratooitous or do you expect to be paid for it
you're an impudent fellow
that's a very cheerin' reflection said dick goodnaturedly
do you expect to get this place when there's gentlemen's sons applying for it
a bootblack in a store
that would be a good joke
boys as well as men are selfish and looking upon dick as a possible rival the boys who listened seemed disposed to take the same view of the situation
that's what i say said one of them taking sides with roswell
don't trouble yourselves said dick
i aint agoin' to cut you out
i can't afford to give up a independent and loocrative purfession for a salary of three dollars a week
hear him talk
said roswell crawford with an unpleasant sneer
if you are not trying to get the place what are you here for
i came with a friend of mine said dick indicating fosdick who's goin' in for the situation
is he a bootblack too
demanded roswell superciliously
he
retorted dick loftily
didn't you know his father was a member of congress and intimately acquainted with all the biggest men in the state
the boys surveyed fosdick as if they did not quite know whether to credit this statement which for the credit of dick's veracity it will be observed he did not assert but only propounded in the form of a question
there was no time for comment however as just then the proprietor of the store came to the door and casting his eyes over the waiting group singled out roswell crawford and asked him to enter
well my lad how old are you
fourteen years old said roswell consequentially
are your parents living
only my mother
my father is dead
he was a gentleman he added complacently
oh was he
said the shopkeeper
do you live in the city
yes sir
in clinton place
have you ever been in a situation before
yes sir said roswell a little reluctantly
where was it
in an office on dey street
how long were you there
a week
it seems to me that was a short time
why did you not stay longer
because said roswell loftily the man wanted me to get to the office at eight o'clock and make the fire
i'm a gentleman's son and am not used to such dirty work
indeed
said the shopkeeper
well young gentleman you may step aside a few minutes
i will speak with some of the other boys before making my selection
several other boys were called in and questioned
roswell stood by and listened with an air of complacency
he could not help thinking his chances the best
the man can see i'm a gentleman and will do credit to his store he thought
at length it came to fosdick's turn
he entered with no very sanguine anticipations of success
unlike roswell he set a very low estimate upon his qualifications when compared with those of other applicants
but his modest bearing and quiet gentlemanly manner entirely free from pretension prepossessed the shopkeeper who was a sensible man in his favor
do you reside in the city
he asked
yes sir said henry
what is your age
twelve
have you ever been in any situation
no sir
i should like to see a specimen of your handwriting
here take the pen and write your name
henry fosdick had a very handsome handwriting for a boy of his age while roswell who had submitted to the same test could do little more than scrawl
do you reside with your parents
no sir they are dead
where do you live then
in mott street
roswell curled his lip when this name was pronounced for mott street as my new york readers know is in the immediate neighborhood of the fivepoints and very far from a fashionable locality
have you any testimonials to present
asked mr henderson for that was his name
fosdick hesitated
this was the question which he had foreseen would give him trouble
but at this moment it happened most opportunely that mr greyson entered the shop with the intention of buying a hat
yes said fosdick promptly i will refer to this gentleman
how do you do fosdick
asked mr greyson noticing him for the first time
how do you happen to be here
i am applying for a place sir said fosdick
may i refer the gentleman to you
certainly i shall be glad to speak a good word for you
mr henderson this is a member of my sundayschool class of whose good qualities and good abilities i can speak confidently
that will be sufficient said the shopkeeper who knew mr greyson's high character and position
he could have no better recommendation
you may come to the store tomorrow morning at half past seven o'clock
the pay will be three dollars a week for the first six months
if i am satisfied with you i shall then raise it to five dollars
the other boys looked disappointed but none more so than roswell crawford
he would have cared less if any one else had obtained the situation but for a boy who lived in mott street to be preferred to him a gentleman's son he considered indeed humiliating
in a spirit of petty spite he was tempted to say  he's a bootblack
ask him if he isn't
he's an honest and intelligent lad said mr greyson
as for you young man i only hope you have onehalf his good qualities
roswell crawford left the store in disgust and the other unsuccessful applicants with him
what luck fosdick
asked dick eagerly as his friend came out of the store
i've got the place said fosdick in accents of satisfaction but it was only because mr greyson spoke up for me
he's a trump said dick enthusiastically
the gentleman so denominated came out before the boys went away and spoke with them kindly
both dick and henry were highly pleased at the success of the application
the pay would indeed be small but expended economically fosdick thought he could get along on it receiving his room rent as before in return for his services as dick's private tutor
dick determined as soon as his education would permit to follow his companion's example
i don't know as you'll be willin' to room with a bootblack he said to henry now you're goin' into business
i couldn't room with a better friend dick said fosdick affectionately throwing his arm round our hero
when we part it'll be because you wish it
so fosdick entered upon a new career
chapter xx  nine months later   the next morning fosdick rose early put on his new suit and after getting breakfast set out for the broadway store in which he had obtained a position
he left his little blackingbox in the room
it'll do to brush my own shoes he said
who knows but i may have to come back to it again
no danger said dick i'll take care of the feet and you'll have to look after the heads now you're in a hatstore
i wish you had a place too said fosdick
i don't know enough yet said dick
wait till i've gradooated
and can put ab
after your name
what's that
it stands for bachelor of arts
it's a degree that students get when they graduate from college
oh said dick i didn't know but it meant a bootblack
i can put that after my name now
wouldn't dick hunter ab sound tiptop
i must be going said fosdick
it won't do for me to be late the very first morning
that's the difference between you and me said dick
i'm my own boss and there aint no one to find fault with me if i'm late
but i might as well be goin' too
there's a gent as comes down to his store pretty early that generally wants a shine
the two boys parted at the park
fosdick crossed it and proceeded to the hatstore while dick hitching up his pants began to look about him for a customer
it was seldom that dick had to wait long
he was always on the alert and if there was any business to do he was always sure to get his share of it
he had now a stronger inducement than ever to attend strictly to business his little stock of money in the savings bank having been nearly exhausted by his liberality to his roommate
he determined to be as economical as possible and moreover to study as hard as he could that he might be able to follow fosdick's example and obtain a place in a store or countingroom
as there were no striking incidents occurring in our hero's history within the next nine months i propose to pass over that period and recount the progress he made in that time
fosdick was still at the hatstore having succeeded in giving perfect satisfaction to mr henderson
his wages had just been raised to five dollars a week
he and dick still kept house together at mrs mooney's lodginghouse and lived very frugally so that both were able to save up money
dick had been unusually successful in business
he had several regular patrons who had been drawn to him by his ready wit and quick humor and from two of them he had received presents of clothing which had saved him any expense on that score
his income had averaged quite seven dollars a week in addition to this
of this amount he was now obliged to pay one dollar weekly for the room which he and fosdick occupied but he was still able to save one half the remainder
at the end of nine months therefore or thirtynine weeks it will be seen that he had accumulated no less a sum than one hundred and seventeen dollars
dick may be excused for feeling like a capitalist when he looked at the long row of deposits in his little bankbook
there were other boys in the same business who had earned as much money but they had had little care for the future and spent as they went along so that few could boast a bankaccount however small
you'll be a rich man some time dick said henry fosdick one evening
and live on fifth avenoo said dick
perhaps so
stranger things have happened
well said dick if such a misfortin' should come upon me i should bear it like a man
when you see a fifth avenoo manshun for sale for a hundred and seventeen dollars just let me know and i'll buy it as an investment
two hundred and fifty years ago you might have bought one for that price probably
real estate wasn't very high among the indians
just my luck said dick i was born too late
i'd orter have been an indian and lived in splendor on my present capital
i'm afraid you'd have found your present business rather unprofitable at that time
but dick had gained something more valuable than money
he had studied regularly every evening and his improvement had been marvellous
he could now read well write a fair hand and had studied arithmetic as far as interest
besides this he had obtained some knowledge of grammar and geography
if some of my boy readers who have been studying for years and got no farther than this should think it incredible that dick in less than a year and studying evenings only should have accomplished it they must remember that our hero was very much in earnest in his desire to improve
he knew that in order to grow up respectable he must be well advanced and he was willing to work
but then the reader must not forget that dick was naturally a smart boy
his street education had sharpened his faculties and taught him to rely upon himself
he knew that it would take him a long time to reach the goal which he had set before him and he had patience to keep on trying
he knew that he had only himself to depend upon and he determined to make the most of himselfa resolution which is the secret of success in nine cases out of ten
dick said fosdick one evening after they had completed their studies i think you'll have to get another teacher soon
why
asked dick in some surprise
have you been offered a more loocrative position
no said fosdick but i find i have taught you all i know myself
you are now as good a scholar as i am
is that true
said dick eagerly a flush of gratification coloring his brown cheek
yes said fosdick
you've made wonderful progress
i propose now that evening schools have begun that we join one and study together through the winter
all right said dick
i'd be willin' to go now but when i first began to study i was ashamed to have anybody know that i was so ignorant
do you really mean fosdick that i know as much as you
yes dick it's true
then i've got you to thank for it said dick earnestly
you've made me what i am
and haven't you paid me dick
by payin' the roomrent said dick impulsively
what's that
it isn't half enough
i wish you'd take half my money you deserve it
thank you dick but you're too generous
you've more than paid me
who was it took my part when all the other boys imposed upon me
and who gave me money to buy clothes and so got me my situation
oh that's nothing
said dick
it's a great deal dick
i shall never forget it
but now it seems to me you might try to get a situation yourself
do i know enough
you know as much as i do
then i'll try said dick decidedly
i wish there was a place in our store said fosdick
it would be pleasant for us to be together
never mind said dick there'll be plenty of other chances
p'r'aps a t stewart might like a partner
i wouldn't ask more'n a quarter of the profits
which would be a very liberal proposal on your part said fosdick smiling
but perhaps mr stewart might object to a partner living on mott street
i'd just as lieves move to fifth avenoo said dick
i aint got no prejudices in favor of mott street
nor i said fosdick and in fact i have been thinking it might be a good plan for us to move as soon as we could afford
mrs mooney doesn't keep the room quite so neat as she might
no said dick
she aint got no prejudices against dirt
look at that towel
dick held up the article indicated which had now seen service nearly a week and hard service at thatdick's avocation causing him to be rather hard on towels
yes said fosdick i've got about tired of it
i guess we can find some better place without having to pay much more
when we move you must let me pay my share of the rent
we'll see about that said dick
do you propose to move to fifth avenoo
not just at present but to some more agreeable neighborhood than this
we'll wait till you get a situation and then we can decide
a few days later as dick was looking about for customers in the neighborhood of the park his attention was drawn to a fellow bootblack a boy about a year younger than himself who appeared to have been crying
what's the matter tom
asked dick
haven't you had luck today
pretty good said the boy but we're havin' hard times at home
mother fell last week and broke her arm and tomorrow we've got to pay the rent and if we don't the landlord says he'll turn us out
haven't you got anything except what you earn
asked dick
no said tom not now
mother used to earn three or four dollars a week but she can't do nothin' now and my little sister and brother are too young
dick had quick sympathies
he had been so poor himself and obliged to submit to so many privations that he knew from personal experience how hard it was
tom wilkins he knew as an excellent boy who never squandered his money but faithfully carried it home to his mother
in the days of his own extravagance and shiftlessness he had once or twice asked tom to accompany him to the old bowery or tony pastor's but tom had always steadily refused
i'm sorry for you tom he said
how much do you owe for rent
two weeks now said tom
how much is it a week
two dollars a weekthat makes four
have you got anything towards it
no i've had to spend all my money for food for mother and the rest of us
i've had pretty hard work to do that
i don't know what we'll do
i haven't any place to go to and i'm afraid mother'll get cold in her arm
can't you borrow the money somewhere
asked dick
tom shook his head despondingly
all the people i know are as poor as i am said he
they'd help me if they could but it's hard work for them to get along themselves
i'll tell you what tom said dick impulsively i'll stand your friend
have you got any money
asked tom doubtfully
got any money
repeated dick
don't you know that i run a bank on my own account
how much is it you need
four dollars said tom
if we don't pay that before tomorrow night out we go
you haven't got as much as that have you
here are three dollars said dick drawing out his pocketbook
i'll let you have the rest tomorrow and maybe a little more
you're a right down good fellow dick said tom but won't you want it yourself
oh i've got some more said dick
maybe i'll never be able to pay you
s'pose you don't said dick i guess i won't fail
i won't forget it dick
i hope i'll be able to do somethin' for you sometime
all right said dick
i'd ought to help you
i haven't got no mother to look out for
i wish i had
there was a tinge of sadness in his tone as he pronounced the last four words but dick's temperament was sanguine and he never gave way to unavailing sadness
accordingly he began to whistle as he turned away only adding i'll see you tomorrow tom
the three dollars which dick had handed to tom wilkins were his savings for the present week
it was now thursday afternoon
his rent which amounted to a dollar he expected to save out of the earnings of friday and saturday
in order to give tom the additional assistance he had promised dick would be obliged to have recourse to his banksavings
he would not have ventured to trench upon it for any other reason but this
but he felt that it would be selfish to allow tom and his mother to suffer when he had it in his power to relieve them
but dick was destined to be surprised and that in a disagreeable manner when he reached home
chapter xxi  dick loses his bankbook   it was hinted at the close of the last chapter that dick was destined to be disagreeably surprised on reaching home
having agreed to give further assistance to tom wilkins he was naturally led to go to the drawer where he and fosdick kept their bankbooks
to his surprise and uneasiness the drawer proved to be empty  come here a minute fosdick he said
what's the matter dick
i can't find my bankbook nor yours either
what's 'come of them
i took mine with me this morning thinking i might want to put in a little more money
i've got it in my pocket now
but where's mine
asked dick perplexed
i don't know
i saw it in the drawer when i took mine this morning
are you sure
yes positive for i looked into it to see how much you had got
did you lock it again
asked dick
yes didn't you have to unlock it just now
so i did said dick
but it's gone now
somebody opened it with a key that fitted the lock and then locked it ag'in
that must have been the way
it's rather hard on a feller said dick who for the first time since we became acquainted with him began to feel downhearted
don't give it up dick
you haven't lost the money only the bankbook
aint that the same thing
no
you can go to the bank tomorrow morning as soon as it opens and tell them you have lost the book and ask them not to pay the money to any one except yourself
so i can said dick brightening up
that is if the thief hasn't been to the bank today
if he has they might detect him by his handwriting
i'd like to get hold of the one that stole it said dick indignantly
i'd give him a good lickin'
it must have been somebody in the house
suppose we go and see mrs mooney
she may know whether anybody came into our room today
the two boys went downstairs and knocked at the door of a little back sittingroom where mrs mooney generally spent her evenings
it was a shabby little room with a threadbare carpet on the floor the walls covered with a certain largefigured paper patches of which had been stripped off here and there exposing the plaster the remainder being defaced by dirt and grease
but mrs mooney had one of those comfortable temperaments which are tolerant of dirt and didn't mind it in the least
she was seated beside a small pine worktable industriously engaged in mending stockings
goodevening mrs mooney said fosdick politely
goodevening said the landlady
sit down if you can find chairs
i'm hard at work as you see but a poor lone widder can't afford to be idle
we can't stop long mrs mooney but my friend here has had something taken from his room today and we thought we'd come and see you about it
what is it
asked the landlady
you don't think i'd take anything
if i am poor it's an honest name i've always had as all my lodgers can testify
certainly not mrs mooney but there are others in the house that may not be honest
my friend has lost his bankbook
it was safe in the drawer this morning but tonight it is not to be found
how much money was there in it
asked mrs mooney
over a hundred dollars said fosdick
it was my whole fortun' said dick
i was goin' to buy a house next year
mrs mooney was evidently surprised to learn the extent of dick's wealth and was disposed to regard him with increased respect
was the drawer locked
she asked
yes
then it couldn't have been bridget
i don't think she has any keys
she wouldn't know what a bankbook was said fosdick
you didn't see any of the lodgers go into our room today did you
i shouldn't wonder if it was jim travis said mrs mooney suddenly
this james travis was a bartender in a low groggery in mulberry street and had been for a few weeks an inmate of mrs mooney's lodginghouse
he was a coarselooking fellow who from his appearance evidently patronized liberally the liquor he dealt out to others
he occupied a room opposite dick's and was often heard by the two boys reeling upstairs in a state of intoxication uttering shocking oaths
this travis had made several friendly overtures to dick and his roommate and had invited them to call round at the barroom where he tended and take something
but this invitation had never been accepted partly because the boys were better engaged in the evening and partly because neither of them had taken a fancy to mr travis which certainly was not strange for nature had not gifted him with many charms either of personal appearance or manners
the rejection of his friendly proffers had caused him to take a dislike to dick and henry whom he considered stiff and unsocial
what makes you think it was travis
asked fosdick
he isn't at home in the daytime
but he was today
he said he had got a bad cold and had to come home for a clean handkerchief
did you see him
asked dick
yes said mrs mooney
bridget was hanging out clothes and i went to the door to let him in
i wonder if he had a key that would fit our drawer said fosdick
yes said mrs mooney
the bureaus in the two rooms are just alike
i got 'em at auction and most likely the locks is the same
it must have been he said dick looking towards fosdick
yes said fosdick it looks like it
what's to be done
that's what i'd like to know said dick
of course he'll say he hasn't got it and he won't be such a fool as to leave it in his room
if he hasn't been to the bank it's all right said fosdick
you can go there the first thing tomorrow morning and stop their paying any money on it
but i can't get any money on it myself said dick
i told tom wilkins i'd let him have some more money tomorrow or his sick mother'll have to turn out of their lodgin's
how much money were you going to give him
i gave him three dollars today and was goin' to give him two dollars tomorrow
i've got the money dick
i didn't go to the bank this morning
all right
i'll take it and pay you back next week
no dick if you've given three dollars you must let me give two
no fosdick i'd rather give the whole
you know i've got more money than you
no i haven't either said dick the memory of his loss flashing upon him
i thought i was rich this morning but now i'm in destitoot circumstances
cheer up dick you'll get your money back
i hope so said our hero rather ruefully
the fact was that our friend dick was beginning to feel what is so often experienced by men who do business of a more important character and on a larger scale than he the bitterness of a reverse of circumstances
with one hundred dollars and over carefully laid away in the savings bank he had felt quite independent
wealth is comparative and dick probably felt as rich as many men who are worth a hundred thousand dollars
he was beginning to feel the advantages of his steady selfdenial and to experience the pleasures of property
not that dick was likely to be unduly attached to money
let it be said to his credit that it had never given him so much satisfaction as when it enabled him to help tom wilkins in his trouble
besides this there was another thought that troubled him
when he obtained a place he could not expect to receive as much as he was now making from blacking bootsprobably not more than three dollars a weekwhile his expenses without clothing would amount to four dollars
to make up the deficiency he had confidently relied upon his savings which would be sufficient to carry him along for a year if necessary
if he should not recover his money he would be compelled to continue a bootblack for at least six months longer and this was rather a discouraging reflection
on the whole it is not to be wondered at that dick felt unusually sober this evening and that neither of the boys felt much like studying
the two boys consulted as to whether it would be best to speak to travis about it
it was not altogether easy to decide
fosdick was opposed to it
it will only put him on his guard said he and i don't see as it will do any good
of course he will deny it
we'd better keep quiet and watch him and by giving notice at the bank we can make sure that he doesn't get any money on it
if he does present himself at the bank they will know at once that he is a thief and he can be arrested
this view seemed reasonable and dick resolved to adopt it
on the whole he began to think prospects were brighter than he had at first supposed and his spirits rose a little
how'd he know i had any bankbook
that's what i can't make out he said
don't you remember
said fosdick after a moment's thought we were speaking of our savings two or three evenings since
yes said dick
our door was a little open at the time and i heard somebody come upstairs and stop a minute in front of it
it must have been jim travis
in that way he probably found out about your money and took the opportunity today to get hold of it
this might or might not be the correct explanation
at all events it seemed probable
the boys were just on the point of going to bed later in the evening when a knock was heard at the door and to their no little surprise their neighbor jim travis proved to be the caller
he was a sallowcomplexioned young man with dark hair and bloodshot eyes
he darted a quick glance from one to the other as he entered which did not escape the boys' notice
how are ye tonight
he said sinking into one of the two chairs with which the room was scantily furnished
jolly said dick
how are you
tired as a dog was the reply
hard work and poor pay that's the way with me
i wanted to go to the theater tonight but i was hard up and couldn't raise the cash
here he darted another quick glance at the boys but neither betrayed anything
you don't go out much do you
he said  not much said fosdick
we spend our evenings in study
that's precious slow said travis rather contemptuously
what's the use of studying so much
you don't expect to be a lawyer do you or anything of that sort
maybe said dick
i haven't made up my mind yet
if my fellercitizens should want me to go to congress some time i shouldn't want to disapp'int 'em and then readin' and writin' might come handy
well said travis rather abruptly i'm tired and i guess i'll turn in
goodnight said fosdick
the boys looked at each other as their visitor left the room
he came in to see if we'd missed the bankbook said dick
and to turn off suspicion from himself by letting us know he had no money added fosdick
that's so said dick
i'd like to have searched them pockets of his
chapter xxii  tracking the thief   fosdick was right in supposing that jim travis had stolen the bankbook
he was also right in supposing that that worthy young man had come to the knowledge of dick's savings by what he had accidentally overheard
now travis like a very large number of young men of his class was able to dispose of a larger amount of money than he was able to earn
moreover he had no great fancy for work at all and would have been glad to find some other way of obtaining money enough to pay his expenses
he had recently received a letter from an old companion who had strayed out to california and going at once to the mines had been lucky enough to get possession of a very remunerative claim
he wrote to travis that he had already realized two thousand dollars from it and expected to make his fortune within six months
two thousand dollars
this seemed to travis a very large sum and quite dazzled his imagination
he was at once inflamed with the desire to go out to california and try his luck
in his present situation he only received thirty dollars a month which was probably all that his services were worth but went a very little way towards gratifying his expensive tastes
accordingly he determined to take the next steamer to the land of gold if he could possibly manage to get money enough to pay the passage
the price of a steerage passage at that time was seventyfive dollarsnot a large sum certainlybut it might as well have been seventyfive hundred for any chance james travis had of raising the amount at present
his available funds consisted of precisely two dollars and a quarter of which sum one dollar and a half was due to his washerwoman
this however would not have troubled travis much and he would conveniently have forgotten all about it but even leaving this debt unpaid the sum at his command would not help him materially towards paying his passage money
travis applied for help to two or three of his companions but they were all of that kind who never keep an account with savings banks but carry all their spare cash about with them
one of these friends offered to lend him thirtyseven cents and another a dollar but neither of these offers seemed to encourage him much
he was about giving up his project in despair when he learned accidentally as we have already said the extent of dick's savings
one hundred and seventeen dollars
why that would not only pay his passage but carry him up to the mines after he had arrived in san francisco
he could not help thinking it over and the result of this thinking was that he determined to borrow it of dick without leave
knowing that neither of the boys were in their room in the daytime he came back in the course of the morning and being admitted by mrs mooney herself said by way of accounting for his presence that he had a cold and had come back for a handkerchief
the landlady suspected nothing and returning at once to her work in the kitchen left the coast clear
travis at once entered dick's room and as there seemed to be no other place for depositing money tried the bureaudrawers
they were all readily opened except one which proved to be locked
this he naturally concluded must contain the money and going back to his own chamber for the key of the bureau tried it on his return and found to his satisfaction that it would fit
when he discovered the bankbook his joy was mingled with disappointment
he had expected to find bankbills instead
this would have saved all further trouble and would have been immediately available
obtaining money at the savings bank would involve fresh risk
travis hesitated whether to take it or not but finally decided that it would be worth the trouble and hazard
he accordingly slipped the book into his pocket locked the drawer again and forgetting all about the handkerchief for which he had come home went downstairs and into the street
there would have been time to go to the savings bank that day but travis had already been absent from his place of business some time and did not venture to take the additional time required
besides not being very much used to savings banks never having had occasion to use them he thought it would be more prudent to look over the rules and regulations and see if he could not get some information as to the way he ought to proceed
so the day passed and dick's money was left in safety at the bank
in the evening it occurred to travis that it might be well to find out whether dick had discovered his loss
this reflection it was that induced the visit which is recorded at the close of the last chapter
the result was that he was misled by the boys' silence on the subject and concluded that nothing had yet been discovered
good
thought travis with satisfaction
if they don't find out for twentyfour hours it'll be too late then and i shall be all right
there being a possibility of the loss being discovered before the boys went out in the morning travis determined to see them at that time and judge whether such was the case
he waited therefore until he heard the boys come out and then opened his own door
morning gents said he sociably
going to business
yes said dick
i'm afraid my clerks'll be lazy if i aint on hand
good joke
said travis
if you pay good wages i'd like to speak for a place
i pay all i get myself said dick
how's business with you
so so
why don't you call round some time
all my evenin's is devoted to literatoor and science said dick
thank you all the same
where do you hang out
inquired travis in choice language addressing fosdick
at henderson's hat and cap store on broadway
i'll look in upon you some time when i want a tile said travis
i suppose you sell cheaper to your friends
i'll be as reasonable as i can said fosdick not very cordially for he did not much fancy having it supposed by his employer that such a disreputablelooking person as travis was a friend of his
however travis had no idea of showing himself at the broadway store and only said this by way of making conversation and encouraging the boys to be social
you haven't any of you gents seen a pearlhandled knife have you
he asked
no said fosdick have you lost one
yes said travis with unblushing falsehood
i left it on my bureau a day or two since
i've missed one or two other little matters
bridget don't look to me any too honest
likely she's got 'em
what are you goin' to do about it
said dick
i'll keep mum unless i lose something more and then i'll kick up a row and haul her over the coals
have you missed anything
no said fosdick answering for himself as he could do without violating the truth
there was a gleam of satisfaction in the eyes of travis as he heard this
they haven't found it out yet he thought
i'll bag the money today and then they may whistle for it
having no further object to serve in accompanying the boys he bade them goodmorning and turned down another street
he's mighty friendly all of a sudden said dick
yes said fosdick it's very evident what it all means
he wants to find out whether you have discovered your loss or not
but he didn't find out
no we've put him on the wrong track
he means to get his money today no doubt
my money suggested dick
i accept the correction said fosdick
of course dick you'll be on hand as soon as the bank opens
in course i shall
jim travis'll find he's walked into the wrong shop
the bank opens at ten o'clock you know
i'll be there on time
the two boys separated
good luck dick said fosdick as he parted from him
it'll all come out right i think
i hope 'twill said dick
he had recovered from his temporary depression and made up his mind that the money would be recovered
he had no idea of allowing himself to be outwitted by jim travis and enjoyed already in anticipation the pleasure of defeating his rascality
it wanted two hours and a half yet to ten o'clock and this time to dick was too precious to be wasted
it was the time of his greatest harvest
he accordingly repaired to his usual place of business succeeded in obtaining six customers which yielded him sixty cents
he then went to a restaurant and got some breakfast
it was now halfpast nine and dick feeling that it wouldn't do to be late left his box in charge of johnny nolan and made his way to the bank
the officers had not yet arrived and dick lingered on the outside waiting till they should come
he was not without a little uneasiness fearing that travis might be as prompt as himself and finding him there might suspect something and so escape the snare
but though looking cautiously up and down the street he could discover no traces of the supposed thief
in due time ten o'clock struck and immediately afterwards the doors of the bank were thrown open and our hero entered
as dick had been in the habit of making a weekly visit for the last nine months the cashier had come to know him by sight
you're early this morning my lad he said pleasantly
have you got some more money to deposit
you'll be getting rich soon
i don't know about that said dick
my bankbook's been stole
stolen
echoed the cashier
that's unfortunate
not so bad as it might be though
the thief can't collect the money
that's what i came to see about said dick
i was afraid he might have got it already
he hasn't been here yet
even if he had i remember you and should have detected him
when was it taken
yesterday said dick
i missed it in the evenin' when i got home
have you any suspicion as to the person who took it
asked the cashier
dick thereupon told all he knew as to the general character and suspicious conduct of jim travis and the cashier agreed with him that he was probably the thief
dick also gave his reason for thinking that he would visit the bank that morning to withdraw the funds
very good said the cashier
we'll be ready for him
what is the number of your book
no
 said dick
now give me a little description of this travis whom you suspect
dick accordingly furnished a brief outline sketch of travis not particularly complimentary to the latter
that will answer
i think i shall know him said the cashier
you may depend upon it that he shall receive no money on your account
thank you said dick
considerably relieved in mind our hero turned towards the door thinking that there would be nothing gained by his remaining longer while he would of course lose time
he had just reached the doors which were of glass when through them he perceived james travis himself just crossing the street and apparently coming towards the bank
it would not do of course for him to be seen
here he is he exclaimed hurrying back
can't you hide me somewhere
i don't want to be seen
the cashier understood at once how the land lay
he quickly opened a little door and admitted dick behind the counter
stoop down he said so as not to be seen
dick had hardly done so when jim travis opened the outer door and looking about him in a little uncertainty walked up to the cashier's desk
chapter xxiii  travis is arrested   jim travis advanced into the bank with a doubtful step knowing well that he was on a dishonest errand and heartily wishing that he were well out of it
after a little hesitation he approached the payingteller and exhibiting the bankbook said i want to get my money out
the bankofficer took the book and after looking at it a moment said how much do you want
the whole of it said travis
you can draw out any part of it but to draw out the whole requires a week's notice
then i'll take a hundred dollars
are you the person to whom the book belongs
yes sir said travis without hesitation
your name is  hunter
the bankclerk went to a large folio volume containing the names of depositors and began to turn over the leaves
while he was doing this he managed to send out a young man connected with the bank for a policeman
travis did not perceive this or did not suspect that it had anything to do with himself
not being used to savings banks he supposed the delay only what was usual
after a search which was only intended to gain time that a policeman might be summoned the cashier came back and sliding out a piece of paper to travis said it will be necessary for you to write an order for the money
travis took a pen which he found on the ledge outside and wrote the order signing his name dick hunter having observed that name on the outside of the book
your name is dick hunter then
said the cashier taking the paper and looking at the thief over his spectacles
yes said travis promptly
but continued the cashier i find hunter's age is put down on the bankbook as fourteen
surely you must be more than that
travis would gladly have declared that he was only fourteen but being in reality twentythree and possessing a luxuriant pair of whiskers this was not to be thought of
he began to feel uneasy
dick hunter's my younger brother he said
i'm getting out the money for him
i thought you said your own name was dick hunter said the cashier
i said my name was hunter said travis ingeniously
i didn't understand you
but you've signed the name of dick hunter to this order
how is that
questioned the troublesome cashier
travis saw that he was getting himself into a tight place but his selfpossession did not desert him
i thought i must give my brother's name he answered
what is your own name
henry hunter
can you bring any one to testify that the statement you are making is correct
yes a dozen if you like said travis boldly
give me the book and i'll come back this afternoon
i didn't think there'd be such a fuss about getting out a little money
wait a moment
why don't your brother come himself
because he's sick
he's down with the measles said travis
here the cashier signed to dick to rise and show himself
our hero accordingly did so
you will be glad to find that he has recovered said the cashier pointing to dick
with an exclamation of anger and dismay travis who saw the game was up started for the door feeling that safety made such a course prudent
but he was too late
he found himself confronted by a burly policeman who seized him by the arm saying not so fast my man
i want you
let me go exclaimed travis struggling to free himself
i'm sorry i can't oblige you said the officer
you'd better not make a fuss or i may have to hurt you a little
travis sullenly resigned himself to his fate darting a look of rage at dick whom he considered the author of his present misfortune
this is your book said the cashier handing back his rightful property to our hero
do you wish to draw out any money
two dollars said dick
very well
write an order for the amount
before doing so dick who now that he saw travis in the power of the law began to pity him went up to the officer and said  won't you let him go
i've got my bankbook back and i don't want anything done to him
sorry i can't oblige you said the officer but i'm not allowed to do it
he'll have to stand his trial
i'm sorry for you travis said dick
i didn't want you arrested
i only wanted my bankbook back
curse you
said travis scowling vindictively
wait till i get free
see if i don't fix you
you needn't pity him too much said the officer
i know him now
he's been to the island before
it's a lie said travis violently
don't be too noisy my friend said the officer
if you've got no more business here we'll be going
he withdrew with the prisoner in charge and dick having drawn his two dollars left the bank
notwithstanding the violent words the prisoner had used towards himself and his attempted robbery he could not help feeling sorry that he had been instrumental in causing his arrest
i'll keep my book a little safer hereafter thought dick
now i must go and see tom wilkins
before dismissing the subject of travis and his theft it may be remarked that he was duly tried and his guilt being clear was sent to blackwell's island for nine months
at the end of that time on his release he got a chance to work his passage on a ship to san francisco where he probably arrived in due time
at any rate nothing more has been heard of him and probably his threat of vengence against dick will never be carried into effect
returning to the city hall park dick soon fell in with tom wilkins
how are you tom
he said
how's your mother
she's better dick thank you
she felt worried about bein' turned out into the street but i gave her that money from you and now she feels a good deal easier
i've got some more for you tom said dick producing a twodollar bill from his pocket
i ought not to take it from you dick
oh it's all right tom
don't be afraid
but you may need it yourself
there's plenty more where that came from
any way one dollar will be enough
with that we can pay the rent
you'll want the other to buy something to eat
you're very kind dick
i'd ought to be
i've only got myself to take care of
well i'll take it for my mother's sake
when you want anything done just call on tom wilkins
all right
next week if your mother doesn't get better i'll give you some more
tom thanked our hero very gratefully and dick walked away feeling the selfapproval which always accompanies a generous and disinterested action
he was generous by nature and before the period at which he is introduced to the reader's notice he frequently treated his friends to cigars and oysterstews
sometimes he invited them to accompany him to the theatre at his expense
but he never derived from these acts of liberality the same degree of satisfaction as from this timely gift to tom wilkins
he felt that his money was well bestowed and would save an entire family from privation and discomfort
five dollars would to be sure make something of a difference in the mount of his savings
it was more than he was able to save up in a week
but dick felt fully repaid for what he had done and he felt prepared to give as much more if tom's mother should continue to be sick and should appear to him to need it
besides all this dick felt a justifiable pride in his financial ability to afford so handsome a gift
a year before however much he might have desired to give it would have been quite out of his power to give five dollars
his cash balance never reached that amount
it was seldom indeed that it equalled one dollar
in more ways than one dick was beginning to reap the advantage of his selfdenial and judicious economy
it will be remembered that when mr whitney at parting with dick presented him with five dollars he told him that he might repay it to some other boy who was struggling upward
dick thought of this and it occurred to him that after all he was only paying up an old debt
when fosdick came home in the evening dick announced his success in recovering his lost money and described the manner it had been brought about
you're in luck said fosdick
i guess we'd better not trust the bureaudrawer again
i mean to carry my book round with me said dick
so shall i as long as we stay at mrs mooney's
i wish we were in a better place
i must go down and tell her she needn't expect travis back
poor chap i pity him
travis was never more seen in mrs mooney's establishment
he was owing that lady for a fortnight's rent of his room which prevented her feeling much compassion for him
the room was soon after let to a more creditable tenant who proved a less troublesome neighbor than his predecessor
chapter xxiv  dick receives a letter   it was about a week after dick's recovery of his bankbook that fosdick brought home with him in the evening a copy of the daily sun
would you like to see your name in print dick
he asked
yes said dick who was busy at the washstand endeavoring to efface the marks which his day's work had left upon his hands
they haven't put me up for mayor have they
'cause if they have i shan't accept
it would interfere too much with my private business
no said fosdick they haven't put you up for office yet though that may happen sometime
but if you want to see your name in print here it is
dick was rather incredulous but having dried his hands on the towel took the paper and following the directions of fosdick's finger observed in the list of advertised letters the name of ragged dick
by gracious so it is said he
do you s'pose it means me
i don't know of any other ragged dickdo you
no said dick reflectively it must be me
but i don't know of anybody that would be likely to write to me
perhaps it is frank whitney suggested fosdick after a little reflection
didn't he promise to write to you
yes said dick and he wanted me to write to him
where is he now
he was going to a boardingschool in connecticut he said
the name of the town was barnton
very likely the letter is from him
i hope it is
frank was a tiptop boy and he was the first that made me ashamed of bein' so ignorant and dirty
you had better go to the postoffice tomorrow morning and ask for the letter
p'r'aps they won't give it to me
suppose you wear the old clothes you used to a year ago when frank first saw you
they won't have any doubt of your being ragged dick then
i guess i will
i'll be sort of ashamed to be seen in 'em though said dick who had considerable more pride in a neat personal appearance than when we were first introduced to him
it will be only for one day or one morning said fosdick
i'd do more'n that for the sake of gettin' a letter from frank
i'd like to see him
the next morning in accordance with the suggestion of fosdick dick arrayed himself in the long disused washington coat and napoleon pants which he had carefully preserved for what reason he could hardly explain
when fairly equipped dick surveyed himself in the mirrorif the little sevenbynineinch lookingglass with which the room was furnished deserved the name
the result of the survey was not on the whole a pleasing one
to tell the truth dick was quite ashamed of his appearance and on opening the chamberdoor looked around to see that the coast was clear not being willing to have any of his fellowboarders see him in his present attire
he managed to slip out into the street unobserved and after attending to two or three regular customers who came downtown early in the morning he made his way down nassau street to the postoffice
he passed along until he came to a compartment on which he read advertised letters and stepping up to the little window said  there's a letter for me
i saw it advertised in the 'sun' yesterday
what name
demanded the clerk
ragged dick answered our hero
that's a queer name said the clerk surveying him a little curiously
are you ragged dick
if you don't believe me look at my clo'es said dick
that's pretty good proof certainly said the clerk laughing
if that isn't your name it deserves to be
i believe in dressin' up to your name said dick
do you know any one in barnton connecticut
asked the clerk who had by this time found the letter
yes said dick
i know a chap that's at boardin'school there
it appears to be in a boy's hand
i think it must be yours
the letter was handed to dick through the window
he received it eagerly and drawing back so as not to be in the way of the throng who were constantly applying for letters or slipping them into the boxes provided for them hastily opened it and began to read
as the reader may be interested in the contents of the letter as well as dick we transcribe it below
it was dated barnton conn and commenced thus   dear dickyou must excuse my addressing this letter to 'ragged dick' but the fact is i don't know what your last name is nor where you live
i am afraid there is not much chance of your getting this letter but i hope you will
i have thought of you very often and wondered how you were getting along and i should have written to you before if i had known where to direct
let me tell you a little about myself
barnton is a very pretty country town only about six miles from hartford
the boardingschool which i attend is under the charge of ezekiel munroe am
he is a man of about fifty a graduate of yale college and has always been a teacher
it is a large twostory house with an addition containing a good many small bedchambers for the boys
there are about twenty of us and there is one assistant teacher who teaches the english branches
mr munroe or old zeke as we call him behind his back teaches latin and greek
i am studying both these languages because father wants me to go to college
but you won't be interested in hearing about our studies
i will tell you how we amuse ourselves
there are about fifty acres of land belonging to mr munroe so that we have plenty of room for play
about a quarter of a mile from the house there is a goodsized pond
there is a large roundbottomed boat which is stout and strong
every wednesday and saturday afternoon when the weather is good we go out rowing on the pond
mr barton the assistant teacher goes with us to look after us
in the summer we are allowed to go in bathing
in the winter there is splendid skating on the pond
besides this we play ball a good deal and we have various other plays
so we have a pretty good time although we study pretty hard too
i am getting on very well in my studies
father has not decided yet where he will send me to college
i wish you were here dick
i should enjoy your company and besides i should like to feel that you were getting an education
i think you are naturally a pretty smart boy but i suppose as you have to earn your own living you don't get much chance to learn
i only wish i had a few hundred dollars of my own
i would have you come up here and attend school with us
if i ever have a chance to help you in any way you may be sure that i will
i shall have to wind up my letter now as i have to hand in a composition tomorrow on the life and character of washington
i might say that i have a friend who wears a coat that once belonged to the general
but i suppose that coat must be worn out by this time
i don't much like writing compositions
i would a good deal rather write letters
i have written a longer letter than i meant to
i hope you will get it though i am afraid not
if you do you must be sure to answer it as soon as possible
you needn't mind if your writing does look like 'henstracks' as you told me once
goodby dick
you must always think of me as your very true friend  frank whitney
dick read this letter with much satisfaction
it is always pleasant to be remembered and dick had so few friends that it was more to him than to boys who are better provided
again he felt a new sense of importance in having a letter addressed to him
it was the first letter he had ever received
if it had been sent to him a year before he would not have been able to read it
but now thanks to fosdick's instructions he could not only read writing but he could write a very good hand himself
there was one passage in the letter which pleased dick
it was where frank said that if he had the money he would pay for his education himself
he's a tiptop feller said dick
i wish i could see him ag'in
there were two reasons why dick would like to have seen frank
one was the natural pleasure he would have in meeting a friend but he felt also that he would like to have frank witness the improvement he had made in his studies and mode of life
he'd find me a little more 'spectable than when he first saw me thought dick
dick had by this time got up to printing house square
standing on spruce street near the tribune office was his old enemy micky maguire
it has already been said that micky felt a natural enmity towards those in his own condition in life who wore better clothes than himself
for the last nine months dick's neat appearance had excited the ire of the young philistine
to appear in neat attire and with a clean face micky felt was a piece of presumption and an assumption of superiority on the part of our hero and he termed it tryin' to be a swell
now his astonished eyes rested on dick in his ancient attire which was very similar to his own
it was a moment of triumph to him
he felt that pride had had a fall and he could not forbear reminding dick of it
them's nice clo'es you've got on said he sarcastically as dick came up
yes said dick promptly
i've been employin' your tailor
if my face was only dirty we'd be taken for twin brothers
so you've give up tryin' to be a swell
only for this partic'lar occasion said dick
i wanted to make a fashionable call so i put on my regimentals
i don't b'lieve you've got any better clo'es said micky
all right said dick i won't charge you nothin' for what you believe
here a customer presented himself for micky and dick went back to his room to change his clothes before resuming business
chapter xxv  dick writes his first letter   when fosdick reached home in the evening dick displayed his letter with some pride
it's a nice letter said fosdick after reading it
i should like to know frank
i'll bet you would said dick
he's a trump
when are you going to answer it
i don't know said dick dubiously
i never writ a letter
that's no reason why you shouldn't
there's always a first time you know
i don't know what to say said dick
get some paper and sit down to it and you'll find enough to say
you can do that this evening instead of studying
if you'll look it over afterwards and shine it up a little
yes if it needs it but i rather think frank would like it best just as you wrote it
dick decided to adopt fosdick's suggestion
he had very serious doubts as to his ability to write a letter
like a good many other boys he looked upon it as a very serious job not reflecting that after all letterwriting is nothing but talking upon paper
still in spite of his misgivings he felt that the letter ought to be answered and he wished frank to hear from him
after various preparations he at last got settled down to his task and before the evening was over a letter was written
as the first letter which dick had ever produced and because it was characteristic of him my readers may like to read it
here it is   dear franki got your letter this mornin' and was very glad to hear you hadn't forgotten ragged dick
i aint so ragged as i was
openwork coats and trowsers has gone out of fashion
i put on the washington coat and napoleon pants to go to the postoffice for fear they wouldn't think i was the boy that was meant
on my way back i received the congratulations of my intimate friend micky maguire on my improved appearance
i've give up sleepin' in boxes and old wagons findin' it didn't agree with my constitution
i've hired a room in mott street and have got a private tooter who rooms with me and looks after my studies in the evenin'
mott street aint very fashionable but my manshun on fifth avenoo isn't finished yet and i'm afraid it won't be till i'm a grayhaired veteran
i've got a hundred dollars towards it which i've saved up from my earnin's
i haven't forgot what you and your uncle said to me and i'm tryin' to grow up 'spectable
i haven't been to tony pastor's or the old bowery for ever so long
i'd rather save up my money to support me in my old age
when my hair gets gray i'm goin' to knock off blackin' boots and go into some light genteel employment such as keepin' an applestand or disseminatin' peanuts among the people
i've got so as to read pretty well so my tooter says
i've been studyin' geography and grammar also
i've made such astonishin' progress that i can tell a noun from a conjunction as far away as i can see 'em
tell mr munroe that if he wants an accomplished teacher in his school he can send for me and i'll come on by the very next train
or if he wants to sell out for a hundred dollars i'll buy the whole concern and agree to teach the scholars all i know myself in less than six months
is teachin' as good business generally speakin' as blackin' boots
my private tooter combines both and is makin' a fortun' with great rapidity
he'll be as rich as astor some time if he only lives long enough  i should think you'd have a bully time at your school
i should like to go out in the boat or play ball with you
when are you comin' to the city
i wish you'd write and let me know when you do and i'll call and see you
i'll leave my business in the hands of my numerous clerks and go round with you
there's lots of things you didn't see when you was here before
they're getting on fast at the central park
it looks better than it did a year ago
i aint much used to writin' letters
as this is the first one i ever wrote i hope you'll excuse the mistakes
i hope you'll write to me again soon
i can't write so good a letter as you but i'll do my best as the man said when he was asked if he could swim over to brooklyn backwards
goodby frank
thank you for all your kindness
direct your next letter to no
 mott street
your true friend   dick hunter
when dick had written the last word he leaned back in his chair and surveyed the letter with much satisfaction
i didn't think i could have wrote such a long letter fosdick said he
written would be more grammatical dick suggested his friend
i guess there's plenty of mistakes in it said dick
just look at it and see
fosdick took the letter and read it over carefully
yes there are some mistakes he said but it sounds so much like you that i think it would be better to let it go just as it is
it will be more likely to remind frank of what you were when he first saw you
is it good enough to send
asked dick anxiously
yes it seems to me to be quite a good letter
it is written just as you talk
nobody but you could have written such a letter dick
i think frank will be amused at your proposal to come up there as teacher
p'r'aps it would be a good idea for us to open a seleck school here in mott street said dick humorously
we could call it 'professor fosdick and hunter's mott street seminary'
bootblackin' taught by professor hunter
the evening was so far advanced that dick decided to postpone copying his letter till the next evening
by this time he had come to have a very fair handwriting so that when the letter was complete it really looked quite creditable and no one would have suspected that it was dick's first attempt in this line
our hero surveyed it with no little complacency
in fact he felt rather proud of it since it reminded him of the great progress he had made
he carried it down to the postoffice and deposited it with his own hands in the proper box
just on the steps of the building as he was coming out he met johnny nolan who had been sent on an errand to wall street by some gentleman and was just returning
what are you doin' down here dick
asked johnny
i've been mailin' a letter
who sent you
nobody
i mean who writ the letter
i wrote it myself
can you write letters
asked johnny in amazement
why shouldn't i
i didn't know you could write
i can't
then you ought to learn
i went to school once but it was too hard work so i give it up
you're lazy johnnythat's what's the matter
how'd you ever expect to know anything if you don't try
i can't learn
you can if you want to
johnny nolan was evidently of a different opinion
he was a goodnatured boy large of his age with nothing particularly bad about him but utterly lacking in that energy ambition and natural sharpness for which dick was distinguished
he was not adapted to succeed in the life which circumstances had forced upon him for in the streetlife of the metropolis a boy needs to be on the alert and have all his wits about him or he will find himself wholly distanced by his more enterprising competitors for popular favor
to succeed in his profession humble as it is a bootblack must depend upon the same qualities which gain success in higher walks in life
it was easy to see that johnny unless very much favored by circumstances would never rise much above his present level
for dick we cannot help hoping much better things
chapter xxvi  an exciting adventure   dick now began to look about for a position in a store or countingroom
until he should obtain one he determined to devote half the day to blacking boots not being willing to break in upon his small capital
he found that he could earn enough in half a day to pay all his necessary expenses including the entire rent of the room
fosdick desired to pay his half but dick steadily refused insisting upon paying so much as compensation for his friend's services as instructor
it should be added that dick's peculiar way of speaking and use of slang terms had been somewhat modified by his education and his intimacy with henry fosdick
still he continued to indulge in them to some extent especially when he felt like joking and it was natural to dick to joke as my readers have probably found out by this time
still his manners were considerably improved so that he was more likely to obtain a situation than when first introduced to our notice
just now however business was very dull and merchants instead of hiring new assistants were disposed to part with those already in their employ
after making several ineffectual applications dick began to think he should be obliged to stick to his profession until the next season
but about this time something occurred which considerably improved his chances of preferment
this is the way it happened
as dick with a balance of more than a hundred dollars in the savings bank might fairly consider himself a young man of property he thought himself justified in occasionally taking a half holiday from business and going on an excursion
on wednesday afternoon henry fosdick was sent by his employer on an errand to that part of brooklyn near greenwood cemetery
dick hastily dressed himself in his best and determined to accompany him
the two boys walked down to the south ferry and paying their two cents each entered the ferry boat
they remained at the stern and stood by the railing watching the great city with its crowded wharves receding from view
beside them was a gentleman with two childrena girl of eight and a little boy of six
the children were talking gayly to their father
while he was pointing out some object of interest to the little girl the boy managed to creep unobserved beneath the chain that extends across the boat for the protection of passengers and stepping incautiously to the edge of the boat fell over into the foaming water
at the child's scream the father looked up and with a cry of horror sprang to the edge of the boat
he would have plunged in but being unable to swim would only have endangered his own life without being able to save his child
my child
he exclaimed in anguishwho will save my child
a thousandten thousand dollars to any one who will save him
there chanced to be but few passengers on board at the time and nearly all these were either in the cabins or standing forward
among the few who saw the child fall was our hero
now dick was an expert swimmer
it was an accomplishment which he had possessed for years and he no sooner saw the boy fall than he resolved to rescue him
his determination was formed before he heard the liberal offer made by the boy's father
indeed i must do dick the justice to say that in the excitement of the moment he did not hear it at all nor would it have stimulated the alacrity with which he sprang to the rescue of the little boy
little johnny had already risen once and gone under for the second time when our hero plunged in
he was obliged to strike out for the boy and this took time
he reached him none too soon
just as he was sinking for the third and last time he caught him by the jacket
dick was stout and strong but johnny clung to him so tightly that it was with great difficulty he was able to sustain himself
put your arms round my neck said dick
the little boy mechanically obeyed and clung with a grasp strengthened by his terror
in this position dick could bear his weight better
but the ferryboat was receding fast
it was quite impossible to reach it
the father his face pale with terror and anguish and his hands clasped in suspense saw the brave boy's struggles and prayed with agonizing fervor that he might be successful
but it is probable for they were now midway of the river that both dick and the little boy whom he had bravely undertaken to rescue would have been drowned had not a rowboat been fortunately near
the two men who were in it witnessed the accident and hastened to the rescue of our hero
keep up a little longer they shouted bending to their oars and we will save you
dick heard the shout and it put fresh strength into him
he battled manfully with the treacherous sea his eyes fixed longingly upon the approaching boat
hold on tight little boy he said
there's a boat coming
the little boy did not see the boat
his eyes were closed to shut out the fearful water but he clung the closer to his young preserver
six long steady strokes and the boat dashed along side
strong hands seized dick and his youthful burden and drew them into the boat both dripping with water
god be thanked
exclaimed the father as from the steamer he saw the child's rescue
that brave boy shall be rewarded if i sacrifice my whole fortune to compass it
you've had a pretty narrow escape young chap said one of the boatmen to dick
it was a pretty tough job you undertook
yes said dick
that's what i thought when i was in the water
if it hadn't been for you i don't know what would have 'come of us
anyhow you're a plucky boy or you wouldn't have dared to jump into the water after this little chap
it was a risky thing to do
i'm used to the water said dick modestly
i didn't stop to think of the danger but i wasn't going to see that little fellow drown without tryin' to save him
the boat at once headed for the ferry wharf on the brooklyn side
the captain of the ferryboat seeing the rescue did not think it necessary to stop his boat but kept on his way
the whole occurrence took place in less time than i have occupied in telling it
the father was waiting on the wharf to receive his little boy with what feelings of gratitude and joy can be easily understood
with a burst of happy tears he clasped him to his arms
dick was about to withdraw modestly but the gentleman perceived the movement and putting down the child came forward and clasping his hand said with emotion my brave boy i owe you a debt i can never repay
but for your timely service i should now be plunged into an anguish which i cannot think of without a shudder
our hero was ready enough to speak on most occasions but always felt awkward when he was praised
it wasn't any trouble he said modestly
i can swim like a top
but not many boys would have risked their lives for a stranger said the gentleman
but he added with a sudden thought as his glance rested on dick's dripping garments both you and my little boy will take cold in wet clothes
fortunately i have a friend living close at hand at whose house you will have an opportunity of taking off your clothes and having them dried
dick protested that he never took cold but fosdick who had now joined them and who it is needless to say had been greatly alarmed at dick's danger joined in urging compliance with the gentleman's proposal and in the end our hero had to yield
his new friend secured a hack the driver of which agreed for extra recompense to receive the dripping boys into his carriage and they were whirled rapidly to a pleasant house in a side street where matters were quickly explained and both boys were put to bed
i aint used to goin' to bed quite so early thought dick
this is the queerest excursion i ever took
like most active boys dick did not enjoy the prospect of spending half a day in bed but his confinement did not last as long as he anticipated
in about an hour the door of his chamber was opened and a servant appeared bringing a new and handsome suit of clothes throughout
you are to put on these said the servant to dick but you needn't get up till you feel like it
whose clothes are they
asked dick
they are yours
mine
where did they come from
mr rockwell sent out and bought them for you
they are the same size as your wet ones
is he here now
no
he bought another suit for the little boy and has gone back to new york
here's a note he asked me to give you
dick opened the paper and read as follows   please accept this outfit of clothes as the first instalment of a debt which i can never repay
i have asked to have your wet suit dried when you can reclaim it
will you oblige me by calling tomorrow at my counting room no
 pearl street
your friend   james rockwell
chapter xxvii  conclusion   when dick was dressed in his new suit he surveyed his figure with pardonable complacency
it was the best he had ever worn and fitted him as well as if it had been made expressly for him
he's done the handsome thing said dick to himself but there wasn't no 'casion for his givin' me these clothes
my lucky stars are shinin' pretty bright now
jumpin' into the water pays better than shinin' boots but i don't think i'd like to try it more'n once a week
about eleven o'clock the next morning dick repaired to mr rockwell's countingroom on pearl street
he found himself in front of a large and handsome warehouse
the countingroom was on the lower floor
our hero entered and found mr rockwell sitting at a desk
no sooner did that gentleman see him than he arose and advancing shook dick by the hand in the most friendly manner
my young friend he said you have done me so great service that i wish to be of some service to you in return
tell me about yourself and what plans or wishes you have formed for the future
dick frankly related his past history and told mr rockwell of his desire to get into a store or countingroom and of the failure of all his applications thus far
the merchant listened attentively to dick's statement and when he had finished placed a sheet of paper before him and handing him a pen said will you write your name on this piece of paper
dick wrote in a free bold hand the name richard hunter
he had very much improved in his penmanship as has already been mentioned and now had no cause to be ashamed of it
mr rockwell surveyed it approvingly
how would you like to enter my countingroom as clerk richard
he asked
dick was about to say bully when he recollected himself and answered very much
i suppose you know something of arithmetic do you not
yes sir
then you may consider yourself engaged at a salary of ten dollars a week
you may come next monday morning
ten dollars
repeated dick thinking he must have misunderstood
yes will that be sufficient
it's more than i can earn said dick honestly
perhaps it is at first said mr rockwell smiling but i am willing to pay you that
i will besides advance you as fast as your progress will justify it
dick was so elated that he hardly restrained himself from some demonstration which would have astonished the merchant but he exercised selfcontrol and only said i'll try to serve you so faithfully sir that you won't repent having taken me into your service
and i think you will succeed said mr rockwell encouragingly
i will not detain you any longer for i have some important business to attend to
i shall expect to see you on monday morning
dick left the countingroom hardly knowing whether he stood on his head or his heels so overjoyed was he at the sudden change in his fortunes
ten dollars a week was to him a fortune and three times as much as he had expected to obtain at first
indeed he would have been glad only the day before to get a place at three dollars a week
he reflected that with the stock of clothes which he had now on hand he could save up at least half of it and even then live better than he had been accustomed to do so that his little fund in the savings bank instead of being diminished would be steadily increasing
then he was to be advanced if he deserved it
it was indeed a bright prospect for a boy who only a year before could neither read nor write and depended for a night's lodging upon the chance hospitality of an alleyway or old wagon
dick's great ambition to grow up 'spectable seemed likely to be accomplished after all
i wish fosdick was as well off as i am he thought generously
but he determined to help his less fortunate friend and assist him up the ladder as he advanced himself
when dick entered his room on mott street he discovered that some one else had been there before him and two articles of wearing apparel had disappeared
by gracious
he exclaimed somebody's stole my washington coat and napoleon pants
maybe it's an agent of barnum's who expects to make a fortun' by exhibitin' the valooable wardrobe of a gentleman of fashion
dick did not shed many tears over his loss as in his present circumstances he never expected to have any further use for the wellworn garments
it may be stated that he afterwards saw them adorning the figure of micky maguire but whether that estimable young man stole them himself he never ascertained
as to the loss dick was rather pleased that it had occurred
it seemed to cut him off from the old vagabond life which he hoped never to resume
henceforward he meant to press onward and rise as high as possible
although it was yet only noon dick did not go out again with his brush
he felt that it was time to retire from business
he would leave his share of the public patronage to other boys less fortunate than himself
that evening dick and fosdick had a long conversation
fosdick rejoiced heartily in his friend's success and on his side had the pleasant news to communicate that his pay had been advanced to six dollars a week
i think we can afford to leave mott street now he continued
this house isn't as neat as it might be and i shall like to live in a nicer quarter of the city
all right said dick
we'll hunt up a new room tomorrow
i shall have plenty of time having retired from business
i'll try to get my reg'lar customers to take johnny nolan in my place
that boy hasn't any enterprise
he needs some body to look out for him
you might give him your box and brush too dick
no said dick i'll give him some new ones but mine i want to keep to remind me of the hard times i've had when i was an ignorant bootblack and never expected to be anything better
when in short you were 'ragged dick'
you must drop that name and think of yourself now as  richard hunter esq said our hero smiling
a young gentleman on the way to fame and fortune added fosdick
   here ends the story of ragged dick
as fosdick said he is ragged dick no longer
he has taken a step upward and is determined to mount still higher
there are fresh adventures in store for him and for others who have been introduced in these pages
those who have felt interested in his early life will find his history continued in a new volume forming the second of the series to be called  fame and fortune  or  the progress of richard hunter
