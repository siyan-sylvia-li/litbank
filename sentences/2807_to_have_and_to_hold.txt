chapter i in which i throw ambsace   the work of the day being over i sat down upon my doorstep pipe in hand to rest awhile in the cool of the evening
death is not more still than is this virginian land in the hour when the sun has sunk away and it is black beneath the trees and the stars brighten slowly and softly one by one
the birds that sing all day have hushed and the horned owls the monster frogs and that strange and ominous fowl if fowl it be and not as some assert a spirit damned which we english call the whippoorwill are yet silent
later the wolf will howl and the panther scream but now there is no sound
the winds are laid and the restless leaves droop and are quiet
the low lap of the water among the reeds is like the breathing of one who sleeps in his watch beside the dead
i marked the light die from the broad bosom of the river leaving it a dead man's hue
awhile ago and for many evenings it had been crimsona river of blood
a week before a great meteor had shot through the night bloodred and bearded drawing a slowfading fiery trail across the heavens and the moon had risen that same night bloodred and upon its disk there was drawn in shadow a thing most marvelously like a scalping knife
wherefore the following day being sunday good mr stockham our minister at weyanoke exhorted us to be on our guard and in his prayer besought that no sedition or rebellion might raise its head amongst the indian subjects of the lord's anointed
afterward in the churchyard between the services the more timorous began to tell of divers portents which they had observed and to recount old tales of how the savages distressed us in the starving time
the bolder spirits laughed them to scorn but the women began to weep and cower and i though i laughed too thought of smith and how he ever held the savages and more especially that opechancanough who was now their emperor in a most deep distrust telling us that the red men watched while we slept that they might teach wiliness to a jesuit and how to bide its time to a cat crouched before a mousehole
i thought of the terms we now kept with these heathen of how they came and went familiarly amongst us spying out our weakness and losing the salutary awe which that noblest captain had struck into their souls of how many were employed as hunters to bring down deer for lazy masters of how breaking the law and that not secretly we gave them knives and arms a soldier's bread in exchange for pelts and pearls of how their emperor was forever sending us smooth messages of how their lips smiled and their eyes frowned
that afternoon as i rode home through the lengthening shadows a hunter redbrown and naked rose from behind a fallen tree that sprawled across my path and made offer to bring me my meat from the moon of corn to the moon of stags in exchange for a gun
there was scant love between the savages and myselfit was answer enough when i told him my name
i left the dark figure standing still as a carved stone in the heavy shadow of the trees and spurring my horse sent me from home the year before by my cousin percy was soon at my housea poor and rude one but pleasantly set upon a slope of green turf and girt with maize and the broad leaves of the tobacco
when i had had my supper i called from their hut the two paspahegh lads bought by me from their tribe the michaelmas before and soundly flogged them both having in my mind a saying of my ancient captain's namely he who strikes first ofttimes strikes last  upon the afternoon of which i now speak in the midsummer of the year of grace  as i sat upon my doorstep my long pipe between my teeth and my eyes upon the pallid stream below my thoughts were busy with these mattersso busy that i did not see a horse and rider emerge from the dimness of the forest into the cleared space before my palisade nor knew until his voice came up the bank that my good friend master john rolfe was without and would speak to me
i went down to the gate and unbarring it gave him my hand and led the horse within the inclosure
thou careful man he said with a laugh as he dismounted
who else think you in this or any other hundred now bars his gate when the sun goes down  it is my sunset gun i answered briefly fastening his horse as i spoke
he put his arm about my shoulder for we were old friends and together we went up the green bank to the house and when i had brought him a pipe sat down side by side upon the doorstep
of what were you dreaming he asked presently when we had made for ourselves a great cloud of smoke
i called you twice  i was wishing for dale's times and dale's laws  he laughed and touched my knee with his hand white and smooth as a woman's and with a green jewel upon the forefinger
thou mars incarnate he cried
thou first last and in the meantime soldier
why what wilt thou do when thou gettest to heaven
make it too hot to hold thee
or take out letters of marque against the enemy  i am not there yet i said dryly
in the meantime i would like a commission againstyour relatives  he laughed then sighed and sinking his chin into his hand and softly tapping his foot against the ground fell into a reverie
i would your princess were alive i said presently
so do i he answered softly
so do i locking his hands behind his head he raised his quiet face to the evening star
brave and wise and gentle he mused
if i did not think to meet her again beyond that star i could not smile and speak calmly ralph as i do now  't is a strange thing i said as i refilled my pipe
love for your brotherinarms love for your commander if he be a commander worth having love for your horse and dog i understand
but wedded love
to tie a burden around one's neck because 't is pink and white or clear bronze and shaped with elegance
faugh  yet i came with half a mind to persuade thee to that very burden he cried with another laugh
thanks for thy pains i said blowing blue rings into the air
i have ridden today from jamestown he went on
i was the only man i' faith that cared to leave its gates and i met the worldthe bachelor worldflocking to them
not a mile of the way but i encountered tom dick and harry dressed in their sunday bravery and making full tilt for the city
and the boats upon the river
i have seen the thames less crowded  there was more passing than usual i said but i was busy in the fields and did not attend
what's the lodestar  the star that draws us allsome to ruin some to bliss ineffable woman  humph
the maids have come then  he nodded
there's a goodly ship down there with a goodly lading  videlicet some fourscore waiting damsels and milkmaids warranted honest by my lord warwick i muttered
this business hath been of edwyn sandys' management as you very well know he rejoined with some heat
his word is good therefore i hold them chaste
that they are fair i can testify having seen them leave the ship  fair and chaste i said but meanly born  i grant you that he answered
but after all what of it
beggars must not be choosers
the land is new and must be peopled nor will those who come after us look too curiously into the lineage of those to whom a nation owes its birth
what we in these plantations need is a loosening of the bonds which tie us to home to england and a tightening of those which bind us to this land in which we have cast our lot
we put our hand to the plough but we turn our heads and look to our egypt and its fleshpots
't is children and wifebe that wife princess or peasantthat make home of a desert that bind a man with chains of gold to the country where they abide
wherefore when at midday i met good master wickham rowing down from henricus to jamestown to offer his aid to master bucke in his press of business tomorrow i gave the good man godspeed and thought his a fruitful errand and one pleasing to the lord  amen i yawned
i love the land and call it home
my withers are unwrung  he rose to his feet and began to pace the greensward before the door
my eyes followed his trim figure richly though sombrely clad then fell with a sudden dissatisfaction upon my own stained and frayed apparel
ralph he said presently coming to a stand before me have you ever an hundred and twenty pounds of tobacco in hand
if not i  i have the weed i replied
what then  then at dawn drop down with the tide to the city and secure for thyself one of these same errant damsels  i stared at him and then broke into laughter in which after a space and unwillingly he himself joined
when at length i wiped the water from my eyes it was quite dark the whippoorwills had begun to call and rolfe must needs hasten on
i went with him down to the gate
take my adviceit is that of your friend he said as he swung himself into the saddle
he gathered up the reins and struck spurs into his horse then turned to call back to me sleep upon my words ralph and the next time i come i look to see a farthingale behind thee  thou art as like to see one upon me i answered
nevertheless when he had gone and i climbed the bank and reentered the house it was with a strange pang at the cheerlessness of my hearth and an angry and unreasoning impatience at the lack of welcoming face or voice
in god's name who was there to welcome me
none but my hounds and the flying squirrel i had caught and tamed
groping my way to the corner i took from my store two torches lit them and stuck them into the holes pierced in the mantel shelf then stood beneath the clear flame and looked with a sudden sick distaste upon the disorder which the light betrayed
the fire was dead and ashes and embers were scattered upon the hearth fragments of my last meal littered the table and upon the unwashed floor lay the bones i had thrown my dogs
dirt and confusion reigned only upon my armor my sword and gun my hunting knife and dagger there was no spot or stain
i turned to gaze upon them where they hung against the wall and in my soul i hated the piping times of peace and longed for the camp fire and the call to arms
with an impatient sigh i swept the litter from the table and taking from the shelf that held my meagre library a bundle of master shakespeare's plays gathered for me by rolfe when he was last in london i began to read but my thoughts wandered and the tale seemed dull and oft told
i tossed it aside and taking dice from my pocket began to throw
as i cast the bits of bone idly and scarce caring to observe what numbers came uppermost i had a vision of the forester's hut at home where when i was a boy in the days before i ran away to the wars in the low countries i had spent many a happy hour
again i saw the bright light of the fire reflected in each wellscrubbed crock and pannikin again i heard the cheerful hum of the wheel again the face of the forester's daughter smiled upon me
the old gray manor house where my mother a stately dame sat ever at her tapestry and an imperious elder brother strode to and fro among his hounds seemed less of home to me than did that tiny friendly hut
tomorrow would be my thirtysixth birthday
all the numbers that i cast were high
if i throw ambsace i said with a smile for my own caprice curse me if i do not take rolfe's advice  i shook the box and clapped it down upon the table then lifted it and stared with a lengthening face at what it had hidden which done i diced no more but put out my lights and went soberly to bed
chapter ii in which i meet master jeremy sparrow   mine are not dicers' oaths
the stars were yet shining when i left the house and after a word with my man diccon at the servants' huts strode down the bank and through the gate of the palisade to the wharf where i loosed my boat put up her sail and turned her head down the broad stream
the wind was fresh and favorable and we went swiftly down the river through the silver mist toward the sunrise
the sky grew pale pink to the zenith then the sun rose and drank up the mist
the river sparkled and shone from the fresh green banks came the smell of the woods and the song of birds above rose the sky bright blue with a few fleecy clouds drifting across it
i thought of the day thirteen years before when for the first time white men sailed up this same river and of how noble its width how enchanting its shores how gay and sweet their blooms and odors how vast their trees how strange the painted savages had seemed to us stormtossed adventurers who thought we had found a very paradise the fortunate isles at least
how quickly were we undeceived
as i lay back in the stern with halfshut eyes and tiller idle in my hand our many tribulations and our few joys passed in review before me
indian attacks dissension and strife amongst our rulers true men persecuted false knaves elevated the weary search for gold and the south sea the horror of the pestilence and the blacker horror of the starving time the arrival of the patience and deliverance whereat we wept like children that most joyful sunday morning when we followed my lord de la warre to church the coming of dale with that stern but wholesome martial code which was no stranger to me who had fought under maurice of nassau the good times that followed when bowlplaying gallants were put down cities founded forts built and the gospel preached the marriage of rolfe and his dusky princess argall's expedition in which i played a part and argall's iniquitous rule the return of yeardley as sir george and the priceless gift he brought usall this and much else old friends old enemies old toils and strifes and pleasures ran bittersweet through my memory as the wind and flood bore me on
of what was before me i did not choose to think sufficient unto the hour being the evil thereof
the river seemed deserted no horsemen spurred along the bridle path on the shore the boats were few and far between and held only servants or indians or very old men
it was as rolfe had said and the free and ablebodied of the plantations had put out posthaste for matrimony
chaplain's choice appeared unpeopled piersey's hundred slept in the sunshine its wharf deserted and but few slowmoving figures in the tobacco fields even the indian villages looked scant of all but squaws and children for the braves were gone to see the palefaces buy their wives
below paspahegh a cockleshell of a boat carrying a great white sail overtook me and i was hailed by young hamor
the maids are come he cried
hurrah and stood up to wave his hat
humph i said
i guess thy destination by thy hose
are they not 'those that were thy peachcolored ones'  oons
yes he answered looking down with complacency upon his tarnished finery
wedding garments captain percy wedding garments  i laughed
thou art a tardy bridegroom
i thought that the bachelors of this quarter of the globe slept last night in jamestown  his face fell
i know it he said ruefully but my doublet had more rents than slashes in it and martin tailor kept it until cockcrow
that fellow rolls in tobacco he hath grown rich off our impoverished wardrobes since the ship down yonder passed the capes
after all he brightened the bargaining takes not place until toward midday after solemn service and thanksgiving
there's time enough he waved me a farewell as his great sail and narrow craft carried him past me
i looked at the sun which truly was not very high with a secret disquietude for i had had a scurvy hope that after all i should be too late and so the noose which i felt tightening about my neck might unknot itself
wind and tide were against me and an hour later saw me nearing the peninsula and marveling at the shipping which crowded its waters
it was as if every sloop barge canoe and dugout between point comfort and henricus were anchored off its shores while above them towered the masts of the marmaduke and furtherance then in port and of the tall ship which had brought in those doves for sale
the river with its dancing freight the blue heavens and bright sunshine the green trees waving in the wind the stir and bustle in the street and market place thronged with gayly dressed gallants made a fair and pleasant scene
as i drove my boat in between the sloop of the commander of shirley hundred and the canoe of the nansemond werowance the two bells then newly hung in the church began to peal and the drum to beat
stepping ashore i had a rear view only of the folk who had clustered along the banks and in the street their faces and footsteps being with one accord directed toward the market place
i went with the throng jostled alike by velvet and dowlas by youths with their estates upon their backs and naked fantastically painted savages and trampling the tobacco with which the greedy citizens had planted the very street
in the square i brought up before the governor's house and found myself cheek by jowl with master pory our secretary and speaker of the assembly
ha ralph percy he cried wagging his gray head we two be the only sane younkers in the plantations
all the others are hornmad  i have caught the infection i said and am one of the bedlamites  he stared then broke into a roar of laughter
art in earnest he asked holding his fat sides
is saul among the prophets  yes i answered
i diced last nightyea or no and the 'yea'plague on 'thad it  he broke into another roar
and thou callest that bridal attire man
why our cowkeeper goes in flaming silk today  i looked down upon my suit of buff which had in truth seen some service and at my great boots which i had not thought to clean since i mired in a swamp coming from henricus the week before then shrugged my shoulders
you will go begging he continued wiping his eyes
not a one of them will so much as look at you  then will they miss seeing a man and not a popinjay i retorted
i shall not break my heart  a cheer arose from the crowd followed by a crashing peal of the bells and a louder roll of the drum
the doors of the houses around and to right and left of the square swung open and the company which had been quartered overnight upon the citizens began to emerge
by twos and threes some with hurried steps and downcast eyes others more slowly and with free glances at the staring men they gathered to the centre of the square where in surplice and band there awaited them godly master bucke and master wickham of henricus
i stared with the rest though i did not add my voice to theirs
before the arrival of yesterday's ship there had been in this natural eden leaving the savages out of the reckoning several thousand adams and but some threescore eves
and for the most part the eves were either portly and bustling or withered and shrewish housewives of age and experience to defy the serpent
these were different
ninety slender figures decked in all the bravery they could assume ninety comely faces pink and white or clear brown with the rich blood showing through ninety pair of eyes laughing and alluring or downcast with long fringes sweeping rounded cheeks ninety pair of ripe red lipsthe crowd shouted itself hoarse and would not be restrained brushing aside like straws the staves of the marshal and his men and surging in upon the line of adventurous damsels
i saw young men panting seize hand or arm and strive to pull toward them some reluctant fair others snatched kisses or fell on their knees and began speeches out of euphues others commenced an inventory of their possessionsacres tobacco servants household plenishing
all was hubbub protestation frightened cries and hysterical laughter
the officers ran to and fro threatening and commanding master pory alternately cried shame and laughed his loudest and i plucked away a jackanapes of sixteen who had his hand upon a girl's ruff and shook him until the breath was wellnigh out of him
the clamor did but increase
way for the governor cried the marshal
shame on you my masters
way for his honor and the worshipful council  the three wooden steps leading down from the door of the governor's house suddenly blossomed into crimson and gold as his honor with the attendant councilors emerged from the hall and stood staring at the mob below
the governor's honest moon face was quite pale with passion
what a devil is this he cried wrathfully
did you never see a woman before
where's the marshal
i'll imprison the last one of you for rioters  upon the platform of the pillory which stood in the centre of the market place suddenly appeared a man of a gigantic frame with a strong face deeply lined and a great shock of grizzled haira strange thing for he was not old
i knew him to be one master jeremy sparrow a minister brought by the southampton a month before and as yet without a charge but at that time i had not spoken with him
without word of warning he thundered into a psalm of thanksgiving singing it at the top of a powerful and yet sweet and tender voice and with a fervor and exaltation that caught the heart of the riotous crowd
the two ministers in the throng beneath took up the strain master pory added a husky tenor eloquent of much sack presently we were all singing
the audacious suitors charmed into rationality fell back and the broken line reformed
the governor and the council descended and with pomp and solemnity took their places between the maids and the two ministers who were to head the column
the psalm ended the drum beat a thundering roll and the procession moved forward in the direction of the church
master pory having left me to take his place among his brethren of the council and the mob of those who had come to purchase and of the curious idle having streamed away at the heels of the marshal and his officers i found myself alone in the square save for the singer who now descended from the pillory and came up to me
captain ralph percy if i mistake not he said in a voice as deep and rich as the bass of an organ
the same i answered
and you are master jeremy sparrow  yea a silly preacherthe poorest meekest and lowliest of the lord's servitors  his deep voice magnificent frame and bold and free address so gave the lie to the humility of his words that i had much ado to keep from laughing
he saw and his face which was of a cast most martial flashed into a smile like sunshine on a scarred cliff
you laugh in your sleeve he said goodhumoredly and yet i am but what i profess to be
in spirit i am a very job though nature hath fit to dress me as a samson
i assure you i am worse misfitted than is master yardstick yonder in those falstaffian hose
but good sir will you not go to church  if the church were paul's i might i answered
as it is we could not get within fifty feet of the door  of the great door ay but the ministers may pass through the side door
if you please i will take you in with me
the pretty fools yonder march slowly if we turn down this lane we will outstrip them quite  agreed i said and we turned into a lane thick planted with tobacco made a detour of the governor's house and outflanked the procession arriving at the small door before it had entered the churchyard
here we found the sexton mounting guard
i am master sparrow the minister that came in the southampton my new acquaintance explained
i am to sit in the choir
let us pass good fellow  the sexton squared himself before the narrow opening and swelled with importance
you reverend sir i will admit such being my duty
but this gentleman is no preacher i may not allow him to pass  you mistake friend said my companion gravely
this gentleman my worthy colleague has but just come from the island of st brandon where he preaches on the witches' sabbath hence the disorder of his apparel
his admittance be on my head wherefore let us by  none to enter at the west door save councilors commander and ministers
any attempting to force an entrance to be arrested and laid by the heels if they be of the generality or if they be of quality to be duly fined and debarred from the purchase of any maid whatsoever  chanted the sexton
then in god's name let's on i exclaimed here try this and i drew from my purse which was something of the leanest a shilling
try this quoth master jeremy sparrow and knocked the sexton down
we left the fellow sprawling in the doorway sputtering threats to the air without but with one covetous hand clutching at the shilling which i threw behind me and entered the church which we found yet empty though through the open great door we heard the drum beat loudly and a deepening sound of footsteps
i have choice of position i said
yonder window seems a good station
you remain here in the choir  ay he answered with a sigh the dignity of my calling must be upheld wherefore i sit in high places rubbing elbows with gold lace when of the very truth the humility of my spirit is such that i would feel more at home in the servants' seats or among the negars that we bought last year  had we not been in church i would have laughed though indeed i saw that he devoutly believed his own words
he took his seat in the largest and finest of the chairs behind the great velvet one reserved for the governor while i went and leaned against my window and we stared at each other across the flowerdecked building in profound silence until with one great final crash the bells ceased the drum stopped beating and the procession entered
chapter iii in which i marry in haste   the long service of praise and thanksgiving was wellnigh over when i first saw her
she sat some ten feet from me in the corner and so in the shadow of a tall pew
beyond her was a row of milkmaid beauties red of cheek free of eye deepbosomed and beribboned like maypoles
i looked again and sawand seea rose amongst blowzed poppies and peonies a pearl amidst glass beads a perdita in a ring of rustics a nonparella of all grace and beauty
as i gazed with all my eyes i found more than grace and beauty in that wonderful facefound pride wit fire determination finally shame and anger
for feeling my eyes upon her she looked up and met what she must have thought the impudent stare of an appraiser
her face which had been without color pale and clear like the sky about the evening star went crimson in a moment
she bit her lip and shot at me one withering glance then dropped her eyelids and hid the lightning
when i looked at her again covertly and from under my hand raised as though to push back my hair she was pale once more and her dark eyes were fixed upon the water and the green trees without the window
the congregation rose and she stood up with the other maids
her dress of dark woolen severe and unadorned her close ruff and prim white coif would have cried puritan had ever puritan looked like this woman upon whom the poor apparel had the seeming of purple and ermine
anon came the benediction
governor councilors commanders and ministers left the choir and paced solemnly down the aisle the maids closed in behind and we who had lined the walls shifting from one heel to the other for a long two hours brought up the rear and so passed from the church to a fair green meadow adjacent thereto
here the company disbanded the wearers of gold lace betaking themselves to seats erected in the shadow of a mighty oak and the ministers of whom there were four bestowing themselves within pulpits of turf
for one altar and one clergyman could not hope to dispatch that day's business
as for the maids for a minute or more they made one cluster then shyly or with laughter they drifted apart like the petals of a windblown rose and silk doublet and hose gave chase
five minutes saw the goodly company of damsels errant and wouldbe bridegrooms scattered far and near over the smiling meadow
for the most part they went man and maid but the fairer of the feminine cohort had rings of clamorous suitors from whom to choose
as for me i walked alone for if by chance i neared a maid she looked womanlike at my apparel first and never reached my face but squarely turned her back
so disengaged i felt like a guest at a mask and in some measure enjoyed the show though with an uneasy consciousness that i was pledged to become sooner or later a part of the spectacle
i saw a shepherdess fresh from arcadia wave back a dozen importunate gallants then throw a knot of blue ribbon into their midst laugh with glee at the scramble that ensued and finally march off with the wearer of the favor
i saw a neighbor of mine tall jack pride who lived twelve miles above me blush and stammer and bow again and again to a milliner's apprentice of a girl not five feet high and all eyes who dropped a curtsy at each bow
when i had passed them fifty yards or more and looked back they were still bobbing and bowing
and i heard a dialogue between phyllis and corydon
says phyllis any poultry  corydon
a matter of twalve hens and twa cocks  phyllis
a cow  corydon
twa  phyllis
how much tobacco  corydon
three acres hinny though i dinna drink the weed mysel'
i'm a stewart woman an' the king's puir cousin  phyllis
what household plenishing  corydon
ane large bed ane flock bed ane trundle bed ane chest ane trunk ane leather cairpet sax cawfskin chairs an' twathree rush five pair o' sheets an' auchteen dowlas napkins sax alchemy spunes  phyllis
i'll take you  at the far end of the meadow near to the fort i met young hamor alone flushed and hurrying back to the more populous part of the field
not yet mated i asked
where are the maids' eyes  by he answered with an angry laugh
if they're all like the sample i've just left i'll buy me a squaw from the paspaheghs  i smiled
so your wooing has not prospered  his vanity took fire
i have not wooed in earnest he said carelessly and hitched forward his cloak of skyblue tuftaffeta with an air
i sheered off quickly enough i warrant you when i found the nature of the commodity i had to deal with  ah i said
when i left the crowd they were going very fast
you had best hurry if you wish to secure a bargain  i'm off he answered then jerking his thumb over his shoulder if you keep on to the river and that clump of cedars you will find termagaunt in ruff and farthingale  when he was gone i stood still for a while and watched the slow sweep of a buzzard high in the blue after which i unsheathed my dagger and with it tried to scrape the dried mud from my boots
succeeding but indifferently i put the blade up stared again at the sky drew a long breath and marched upon the covert of cedars indicated by hamor
as i neared it i heard at first only the wash of the river but presently there came to my ears the sound of a man's voice and then a woman's angry begone sir  kiss and be friends said the man
the sound that followed being something of the loudest for even the most hearty salutation i was not surprised on parting the bushes to find the man nursing his cheek and the maid her hand
you shall pay well for that you sweet vixen he cried and caught her by both wrists
she struggled fiercely bending her head this way and that but his hot lips had touched her face before i could come between
when i had knocked him down he lay where he fell dazed by the blow and blinking up at me with his small ferret eyes
i knew him to be one edward sharpless and i knew no good of him
he had been a lawyer in england
he lay on the very brink of the stream with one arm touching the water
flesh and blood could not resist it so assisted by the toe of my boot he took a cold bath to cool his hot blood
when he had clambered out and had gone away cursing i turned to face her
she stood against the trunk of a great cedar her head thrown back a spot of angry crimson in each cheek one small hand clenched at her throat
i had heard her laugh as sharpless touched the water but now there was only defiance in her face
as we gazed at each other a burst of laughter came to us from the meadow behind
i looked over my shoulder and beheld young hamor probably disappointed of a wifewith giles allen and wynne returning to his abandoned quarry
she saw too for the crimson spread and deepened and her bosom heaved
her dark eyes glancing here and there like those of a hunted creature met my own
madam i said will you marry me  she looked at me strangely
do you live here she asked at last with a disdainful wave of her hand toward the town
no madam i answered
i live up river in weyanoke hundred some miles from here  then in god's name let us be gone she cried with sudden passion
i bowed low and advanced to kiss her hand
the finger tips which she slowly and reluctantly resigned to me were icy and the look with which she favored me was not such an one as poets feign for like occasions
i shrugged the shoulders of my spirit but said nothing
so hand in hand though at arms' length we passed from the shade of the cedars into the open meadow where we presently met hamor and his party
they would have barred the way laughing and making unsavory jests but i drew her closer to me and laid my hand upon my sword
they stood aside for i was the best swordsman in virginia
the meadow was now less thronged
the river up and down was white with sailboats and across the neck of the peninsula went a line of horsemen each with his purchase upon a pillion behind him
the governor the councilors and the commanders had betaken themselves to the governor's house where a great dinner was to be given
but master piersey the cape merchant remained to see the company reimbursed to the last leaf and the four ministers still found occupation though one couple trod not upon the heels of another as they had done an hour agone
i must first satisfy the treasurer i said coming to a halt within fifty feet of the now deserted high places
she drew her hand from mine and looked me up and down
how much is it she asked at last
i will pay it  i stared at her
can't you speak she cried with a stamp of her foot
at what am i valued
ten poundsfifty pounds  at one hundred and twenty pounds of tobacco madam i said dryly
i will pay it myself
to what name upon the ship's list do you answer  patience worth she replied
i left her standing there and went upon my errand with a whirling brain
her enrollment in that company proclaimed her meanly born and she bore herself as of blood royal of her own free will she had crossed an ocean to meet this day and she held in passionate hatred this day and all that it contained she was come to virginia to better her condition and the purse which she had drawn from her bosom was filled with gold pieces
to another i would have advised caution delay application to the governor inquiry for myself i cared not to make inquiries
the treasurer gave me my receipt and i procured from the crowd around him humfrey kent a good man and true and old belfield the perfumer for witnesses
with them at my heels i went back to her and giving her my hand was making for the nearest minister when a voice at a little distance hailed me crying out this way captain percy  i turned toward the voice and beheld the great figure of master jeremy sparrow sitting crosslegged like the grand turk upon a grassy hillock and beckoning to me from that elevation
our acquaintance hath been of the shortest he said genially when the maid the witnesses and i had reached the foot of the hillock but i have taken a liking to you and would fain do you a service
moreover i lack employment
the maids take me for a hedge parson and sheer off to my brethren who truly are of a more clerical appearance
whereas if they could only look upon the inner man
you have been long in choosing but have doubtless chosenhe glanced from me to the woman beside me and broke off with open mouth and staring eyes
there was excuse for her beauty was amazing
a paragon he ended recovering himself
marry us quickly friend i said
clouds are gathering and we have far to go  he came down from his mound and we went and stood before him
i had around my neck the gold chain given me upon a certain occasion by prince maurice and in lieu of other ring i now twisted off the smallest link and gave it to her
your name asked master sparrow opening his book
ralph percy gentleman  and yours he demanded staring at her with a somewhat too apparent delight in her beauty
she flushed richly and bit her lip
he repeated the question
she stood a minute in silence her eyes upon the darkening sky
then she said in a low voice jocelyn leigh  it was not the name i had watched the cape merchant strike off his list
i turned upon her and made her meet my eyes
what is your name i demanded
tell me the truth  i have told it she answered proudly
it is jocelyn leigh  i faced the minister again
go on i said briefly
the company commands that no constraint be put upon its poor maids
wherefore do you marry this man of your own free will and choice  ay she said of my own free will  well we were married and master jeremy sparrow wished us joy and kent would have kissed the bride had i not frowned him off
he and belfield strode away and i left her there and went to get her bundle from the house that had sheltered her overnight
returning i found her seated on the turf her chin in her hand and her dark eyes watching the distant play of lightning
master sparrow had left his post and was nowhere to be seen
i gave her my hand and led her to the shore then loosed my boat and helped her aboard
i was pushing off when a voice hailed us from the bank and the next instant a great bunch of red roses whirled past me and fell into her lap
sweets to the sweet you know said master jeremy sparrow genially
goodwife allen will never miss them  i was in two minds whether to laugh or to swearfor i had never given her flowerswhen she settled the question for me by raising the crimson mass and bestowing it upon the flood
a sudden puff of wind brought the sail around hiding his fallen countenance
the wind freshened coming from the bay and the boat was off like a startled deer
when i next saw him he had recovered his equanimity and with a smile upon his rugged features was waving us a farewell
i looked at the beauty opposite me and with a sudden movement of pity for him mateless stood up and waved to him vigorously in turn
chapter iv in which i am like to repent at leisure   when we had passed the mouth of the chickahominy i broke the silence now prolonged beyond reason by pointing to the village upon its bank and telling her something of smith's expedition up that river ending by asking her if she feared the savages
when at length she succeeded in abstracting her attention from the clouds it was to answer in the negative in a tone of the supremest indifference after which she relapsed into her contemplation of the weather
further on i tried again
that is kent's yonder
he brought his wife from home last year
what a hedge of sunflowers she has planted
if you love flowers you will find those of paradise in these woods  no answer
below martinbrandon we met a canoe full of paspaheghs bound upon a friendly visit to some one of the downriver tribes for in the bottom of the boat reposed a fat buck and at the feet of the young men lay trenchers of maize cakes and of late mulberries
i hailed them and when we were alongside held up the brooch from my hat then pointed to the purple fruit
the exchange was soon made they sped away and i placed the mulberries upon the thwart beside her
i am not hungry she said coldly
take them away  i bit my lip and returned to my place at the tiller
this rose was set with thorns and already i felt their sting
presently she leaned back in the nest i had made for her
i wish to sleep she said haughtily and turning her face from me pillowed her head upon her arms
i sat bent forward the tiller in my hand and stared at my wife in some consternation
this was not the tame pigeon the rosy humble domestic creature who was to make me a home and rear me children
a sea bird with broad white wings swooped down upon the water now dark and ridged rested there a moment then swept away into the heart of the gathering storm
she was liker such an one
such birds were caught at times but never tamed and never kept
the lightning which had played incessantly in pale flashes across the low clouds in the south now leaped to higher peaks and became more vivid and the muttering of the thunder changed to long booming peals
thirteen years before the virginia storms had struck us with terror
compared with those of the old world we had left they were as cannon to the whistling of arrows as breakers on an iron coast to the dull wash of level seas
now they were nothing to me but as the peals changed to great crashes as of falling cities i marveled to see my wife sleeping so quietly
the rain began to fall slowly in large sullen drops and i rose to cover her with my cloak
then i saw that the sleep was feigned for she was gazing at the storm with wide eyes though with no fear in their dark depths
when i moved they closed and when i reached her the lashes still swept her cheeks and she breathed evenly through parted lips
but against her will she shrank from my touch as i put the cloak about her and when i had returned to my seat i bent to one side and saw as i had expected to see that her eyes were wide open again
if she had been one whit less beautiful i would have wished her back at jamestown back on the atlantic back at whatever outlandish place where manners were unknown that had owned her and cast her out
pride and temper
i set my lips and vowed that she should find her match
the storm did not last
ere we had reached piersey's the rain had ceased and the clouds were breaking above chaplain's choice hung a great rainbow we passed tants weyanoke in the glory of the sunset all shattered gold and crimson
not a word had been spoken
i sat in a humor grim enough and she lay there before me wide awake staring at the shifting banks and running water and thinking that i thought she slept
at last my own wharf rose before me through the gathering dusk and beyond it shone out a light for i had told diccon to set my house in order and to provide fire and torches that my wife might see i wished to do her honor
i looked at that wife and of a sudden the anger in my heart melted away
it was a wilderness vast and dreadful to which she had come
the mighty stream the towering forests the black skies and deafening thunder the wild cries of bird and beast the savages uncouth and terriblefor a moment i saw my world as the woman at my feet must see it strange wild and menacing an evil land the other side of the moon
a thing that i had forgotten came to my mind how that after our landing at jamestown years before a boy whom we had with us did each night fill with cries and lamentations the hut where he lay with my cousin percy gosnold and myself nor would cease though we tried both crying shame and a rope's end
it was not for homesickness for he had no mother or kin or home and at length master hunt brought him to confess that it was but pure panic terror of the land itselfnot of the indians or of our hardships both of which he faced bravely enough but of the strange trees and the high and long roofs of vine of the black sliding earth and the white mist of the fireflies and the whippoorwillsa sick fear of primeval nature and her tragic mask
this was a woman young alone and friendless unless i who had sworn to cherish and protect her should prove myself her friend
wherefore when a few minutes later i bent over her it was with all gentleness that i touched and spoke to her
our journey is over i said
this is home my dear  she let me help her to her feet and up the wet and slippery steps to the level of the wharf
it was now quite dark there being no moon and thin clouds obscuring the stars
the touch of her hand which i perforce held since i must guide her over the long narrow and unrailed trestle chilled me and her breathing was hurried but she moved by my side through the gross darkness unfalteringly enough
arrived at the gate of the palisade i beat upon it with the hilt of my sword and shouted to my men to open to us
a moment and a dozen torches came flaring down the bank
diccon shot back the bolts and we entered
the men drew up and saluted for i held my manor a camp my servants soldiers and myself their captain
i have seen worse favored companies but doubtless the woman beside me had not
perhaps too the red light of the torches now flaring brightly now sunk before the wind gave their countenances a more villainous cast than usual
they were not all bad
diccon had the virtue of fidelity if none other there were a brace of puritans and a handful of honest fools who if they drilled badly yet abhorred mutiny
but the half dozen i had taken off argall's hands the dutchmen who might have been own brothers to those two judases adam and francis the thief and the highwayman i had bought from the precious crew sent us by the king the year before the negro and the indianssmall wonder that she shrank and cowered
it was but for a moment
i was yet seeking for words sufficiently reassuring when she was herself again
she did not deign to notice the men's awkward salute and when diccon a handsome rogue enough advancing to light us up the bank brushed by her something too closely she drew away her skirts as though he had been a lazar
at my own door i turned and spoke to the men who had followed us up the ascent
this lady i said taking her hand as she stood beside me is my true and lawful wife your mistress to be honored and obeyed as such
who fails in reverence to her i hold as mutinous to myself and will deal with him accordingly
she gives you tomorrow for holiday with double rations and to each a measure of rum
now thank her properly  they cheered lustily of course and diccon stepping forward gave us thanks in the name of them all and wished us joy
after which with another cheer they backed from out our presence then turned and made for their quarters while i led my wife within the house and closed the door
diccon was an ingenious scoundrel
i had told him to banish the dogs to have the house cleaned and lit and supper upon the table but i had not ordered the floor to be strewn with rushes the walls draped with flowering vines a great jar filled with sunflowers and an illumination of a dozen torches
nevertheless it looked well and i highly approved the capon and maize cakes the venison pasty and ale with which the table was set
through the open doors of the two other rooms were to be seen more rushes more flowers and more lights
to the larger of these rooms i now led the way deposited her bundle upon the settle and saw that diccon had provided fair water for her face and hands which done i told her that supper waited upon her convenience and went back to the great room
she was long in coming so long that i grew impatient and went to call her
the door was ajar and so i saw her kneeling in the middle of the floor her head thrown back her hands raised and clasped on her face terror and anguish of spirit written so large that i started to see it
i stared in amazement and had i followed my first impulse would have gone to her as i would have gone to any other creature in so dire distress
on second thoughts i went noiselessly back to my station in the great room
she had not seen me i was sure
nor had i long to wait
presently she appeared and i could have doubted the testimony of my eyes so changed were the agonized face and figure of a few moments before
beautiful and disdainful she moved to the table and took the great chair drawn before it with the air of an empress mounting a throne
i contented myself with the stool
she ate nothing and scarcely touched the canary i poured for her
i pressed upon her wine and viandsin vain i strove to make conversationequally in vain
finally tired of yes and no uttered as though she were reluctantly casting pearls before swine i desisted and applied myself to my supper in a silence as sullen as her own
at last we rose from table and i went to look to the fastenings of door and windows and returning found her standing in the centre of the room her head up and her hands clenched at her sides
i saw that we were to have it out then and there and i was glad of it
you have something to say i said
i am quite at your command and i went and leaned against the chimneypiece
the low fire upon the hearth burnt lower still before she broke the silence
when she did speak it was slowly and with a voice which was evidently controlled only by a strong effort of a strong will
she said  whenyesterday today ten thousand years ago you went from this horrible forest down to that wretched village yonder to those huts that make your london you went to buy you a wife  yes madam i answered
i went with that intention  you had made your calculation
in your mind you had pitched upon such and such an article with such and such qualities as desirable
doubtless you meant to get your money's worth  doubtless i said dryly
will you tell me what you were inclined to consider its equivalent  i stared at her much inclined to laugh
the interview promised to be interesting
i went to jamestown to get me a wife i said at length because i had pledged my word that i would do so
i was not overanxious
i did not run all the way
but as you say i intended to do the best i could for myself one hundred and twenty pounds of tobacco being a considerable sum and not to be lightly thrown away
i went to look for a mistress for my house a companion for my idle hours a rosy humble docile lass with no aspirations beyond cleanliness and good temper who was to order my household and make me a home
i was to be her head and her law but also her sword and shield
that is what i went to look for  and you foundme she said and broke into strange laughter
i bowed
in god's name why did you not go further  i suppose she saw in my face why i went no further for into her own the color came flaming
i am not what i seem she cried out
i was not in that company of choice  i bowed again
you have no need to tell me that madam i said
i have eyes
i desire to know why you were there at all and why you married me  she turned from me until i could see nothing but the coiled wealth of her hair and the bit of white neck between it and the ruff
we stood so in silence she with bent head and fingers clasping and unclasping i leaning against the wall and staring at her for what seemed a long time
at least i had time to grow impatient when she faced me again and all my irritation vanished in a gasp of admiration
oh she was beautiful and of a sweetness most alluring and fatal
had medea worn such a look sure jason had quite forgot the fleece and with those eyes circe had needed no other charm to make men what she would
her voice when she spoke was no longer imperious it was low pleading music
and she held out entreating hands
have pity on me she said
listen kindly and have pity on me
you are a strong man and wear a sword
you can cut your way through trouble and peril
i am a woman weak friendless helpless
i was in distress and peril and i had no arm to save no knight to fight my battle
i do not love deceit
ah do not think that i have not hated myself for the lie i have been
but these forest creatures that you takewill they not bite against springe and snare
are they scrupulous as to how they free themselves
i too was in the toils of the hunter and i too was not scrupulous
there was a thing of which i stood in danger that would have been bitterer to me a thousand times than death
i had but one thought to escape how i did not careonly to escape
i had a waiting woman named patience worth
one night she came to me weeping
she had wearied of service and had signed to go to virginia as one of sir edwyn sandys' maids and at the last moment her heart had failed her
there had been pressure brought to bear upon me that dayi had been angered to the very soul
i sent her away with a heavy bribe and in her dress and under her name i fled fromi went aboard that ship
no one guessed that i was not the patience worth to whose name i answered
no one knows nownone but you none but you  and why am i so far honored madam i said bluntly
she crimsoned then went white again
she was trembling now through her whole frame
at last she broke out i am not of that crew that came to marry
to me you are the veriest strangeryou are but the hand at which i caught to draw myself from a pit that had been digged for me
it was my hope that this hour would never come
when i fled mad for escape willing to dare anything but that which i left behind i thought 'i may die before that ship with its shameless cargo sets sail'
when the ship set sail and we met with stormy weather and there was much sickness aboard i thought 'i may drown or i may die of the fever'
when this afternoon i lay there in the boat coming up this dreadful river through the glare of the lightning and you thought i slept i was thinking 'the bolts may strike me yet and all will be well'
i prayed for that death but the storm passed
i am not without shame
i know that you must think all ill of me that you must feel yourself gulled and cheated
i am sorrythat is all i can sayi am sorry
i am your wifei was married to you todaybut i know you not and love you not
i ask you to hold me as i hold myself a guest in your house nothing more
i am quite at your mercy
i am entirely friendless entirely alone
i appeal to your generosity to your honor  before i could prevent her she was kneeling to me and she would not rise though i bade her do so
i went to the door unbarred it and looked out into the night for the air within the room stifled me
it was not much better outside
the clouds had gathered again and were now hanging thick and low
from the distance came a rumble of thunder and the whole night was dull heavy and breathless
hot anger possessed me anger against rolfe for suggesting this thing to me anger against myself for that unlucky throw anger most of all against the woman who had so cozened me
in the servants' huts a hundred yards away lights were still burning against rule for the hour was late
glad that there was something i could rail out against i strode down upon the men and caught them assembled in diccon's cabin dicing for tomorrow's rum
when i had struck out the light with my rapier and had rated the rogues to their several quarters i went back through the gathering storm to the brightlylit flowerdecked room and to mistress percy
she was still kneeling her hands at her breast and her eyes wide and dark fixed upon the blackness without the open door
i went up to her and took her by the hand
i am a gentleman madam i said
you need have no fear of me
i pray you to rise  she stood up at that and her breath came hurriedly through her parted lips but she did not speak
it grows late and you must be weary i continued
your room is yonder
i trust that you will sleep well
goodnight  i bowed low and she curtsied to me
goodnight she said
on her way to the door she brushed against the rack wherein hung my weapons
among them was a small dagger
her quick eye caught its gleam and i saw her press closer to the wall and with her right hand strive stealthily to detach the blade from its fastening
she did not understand the trick
her hand dropped to her side and she was passing on when i crossed the room loosened the dagger and offered it to her with a smile and a bow
she flushed scarlet and bit her lips but she took it
there are bars to the door within i said
again goodnight  goodnight she answered and entering the room she shut the door
a moment more and i heard the heavy bars drop into place
chapter v in which a woman has her way   ten days later rolfe going down river in his barge touched at my wharf and finding me there walked with me toward the house
i have not seen you since you laughed my advice to scornand took it  he said
where's the farthingale benedick the married man  in the house  oh ay he commented
it's near to supper time
i trust she's a good cook  she does not cook i said dryly
i have hired old goody cotton to do that  he eyed me closely
by all the gods
a new doublet
she is skillful with her needle then  she may be i answered
having never seen her with one i am no judge
the doublet was made by the tailor at flowerdieu hundred  by this we had reached the level sward at the top of the bank
roses  he exclaimeda long row of them new planted
an arbor too and a seat beneath the big walnut
since when hast thou turned gardner ralph  it's diccon's doing
he is anxious to please his mistress  who neither sews nor cooks nor plants
what does she do  she pulls the roses i said
come in  when we had entered the house he stared about him then cried out acrasia's bower
oh thou sometime guyon and began to laugh
it was late afternoon and the slant sunshine streaming in at door and window striped wall and floor with gold
floor and wall were no longer logs gnarled and stained upon the one lay a carpet of delicate ferns and aromatic leaves and glossy vines purpleberried tapestried the other
flowerspurple and red and yellowwere everywhere
as we entered a figure started up from the hearth
st
george exclaimed rolfe
you have never married a blackamoor  it is the negress angela i said
i bought her from william pierce the other day
mistress percy wished a waiting damsel  the creature one of the five females of her kind then in virginia looked at us with large rolling eyes
she knew a little spanish and i spoke to her in that tongue bidding her find her mistress and tell her that company waited
when she was gone i placed a jack of ale upon the table and rolfe and i sat down to discuss it
had i been in a mood for laughter i could have found reason in his puzzled face
there were flowers upon the table and beside them a litter of small objects one of which he now took up
a white glove he said perfumed and silverfringed and of a size to fit titania  i spread its mate out upon my palm
a woman's hand
too white too soft and too small  he touched lightly one by one the slender fingers of the glove he held
a woman's handstrength in weakness veiled power the star in the mist guiding beckoning drawing upward  i laughed and threw the glove from me
the star a willofthewisp the goal a slough i said
as he sat opposite me a change came over his face a change so great that i knew before i turned that she was in the room
the bundle which i had carried for her from jamestown was neither small nor light
why when she fled she chose to burden herself with such toys or whether she gave a thought to the suspicions that might be raised in virginia if one of sir edwyn's maids bedecked herself in silk and lace and jewels i do not know but she had brought to the forest and the tobacco fields the gauds of a maid of honor
the puritan dress in which i first saw her was a thing of the past she clothed herself now like the parrakeets in the forestor liker the lilies of the field for verily she toiled not neither did she spin
rolfe and i rose from our seats
mistress percy i said let me present to you a right worthy gentleman and my very good friend master john rolfe  she curtsied and he bowed low
he was a man of quick wit and had been at court but for a time he could find no words
then mistress percy's face is not one to be forgotten
i have surely seen it before though where  her color mounted but she answered him indifferently enough
probably in london amongst the spectators of some pageant arranged in honor of the princess your wife sir she said carelessly
i had twice the fortune to see the lady rebekah passing through the streets  not in the streets only he said courteously
i remember now 't was at my lord bishop's dinner
a very courtly company it was
you were laughing with my lord rich
you wore pearls in your hair  she met his gaze fully and boldly
memory plays us strange tricks at times she told him in a clear slightly raised voice and it hath been three years since master rolfe and his indian princess were in london
his memory hath played him false  she took her seat in the great chair which stood in the centre of the room bathed in the sunlight and the negress brought a cushion for her feet
it was not until this was done and until she had resigned her fan to the slave who stood behind her slowly waving the plumed toy to and fro that she turned her lovely face upon us and bade us be seated
an hour later a whippoorwill uttered its cry close to the window through which now shone the crescent moon
rolfe started up
beshrew me
but i had forgot that i am to sleep at chaplain's tonight
i must hurry on  i rose also
you have had no supper i cried
i too have forgotten  he shook his head
i cannot wait
moreover i have feastedyea and drunk deep  his eyes were very bright with an exaltation in them as of wine
mine i felt had the same light
indeed we were both drunk with her laughter her beauty and her wit
when he had kissed her hand and i had followed him out of the house and down the bank he broke the silence
why she came to virginia i do not know   nor care to ask i said
nor care to ask he repeated meeting my gaze
and i know neither her name nor her rank
but as i stand here ralph i saw her a guest at that feast of which i spoke and edwyn sandys picked not his maids from such assemblies  i stopped him with my hand upon his shoulder
she is one of sandys' maids i asserted with deliberation a waiting damsel who wearied of service and came to virginia to better herself
she was landed with her mates at jamestown a week or more agone went with them to church and thence to the courting meadow where she and captain ralph percy a gentleman adventurer so pleased each other that they were married forthwith
that same day he brought her to his house where she now abides his wife and as such to be honored by those who call themselves his friends
and she is not to be lightly spoken of nor comment passed upon her grace beauty and bearing something too great for her station i admit lest idle tales should get abroad  am i not thy friend ralph he asked with smiling eyes
i have thought so at times i answered
my friend's honor is my honor he went on
where his lips are sealed mine open not
art content  content i said and pressed the hand he held out to me
we reached the steps of the wharf and descending them he entered his barge rocking lazily with the advancing tide
his rowers cast loose from the piles and the black water slowly widened between us
from over my shoulder came a sudden bright gleam of light from the house above and i knew that mistress percy was as usual wasting good pine knots
i had a vision of the many lights within and of the beauty whom the world called my wife sitting erect bathed in that rosy glow in the great armchair with the turbaned negress behind her
i suppose rolfe saw the same thing for he looked from the light to me and i heard him draw his breath
ralph percy thou art the very button upon the cap of fortune he said
to myself my laugh sounded something of the bitterest but to him i presume it vaunted my return through the darkness to the lit room and its resplendent pearl
he waved farewell and the dusk swallowed up him and his boat
i went back to the house and to her
she was sitting as we had left her with her small feet crossed upon the cushion beneath them her hands folded in her silken lap the air from the waving fan blowing tendrils of her dark hair against her delicate standing ruff
i went and leaned against the window facing her
i have been chosen burgess for this hundred i said abruptly
the assembly meets next week
i must be in jamestown then and for some time to come  she took the fan from the negress and waved it lazily to and fro
when do we go she asked at last
we i answered
i had thought to go alone  the fan dropped to the floor and her eyes opened wide
and leave me here she exclaimed
leave me in these woods at the mercy of indians wolves and your rabble of servants  i smiled
we are at peace with the indians it would be a stout wolf that could leap this palisade and the servants know their master too well to care to offend their mistress
moreover i would leave diccon in charge  diccon she cried
the old woman in the kitchen hath told me tales of diccon
diccon bravo
diccon gamester
diccon cutthroat  granted i said
but diccon faithful as well
i can trust him  but i do not trust him she retorted
and i wish to go to jamestown
this forest wearies me her tone was imperious
i must think it over i said coolly
i may take you or i may not
i cannot tell yet  but i desire to go sir  and i may desire you to stay  you are a churl  i bowed
i am the man of your choice madam  she rose with a stamp of her foot and turning her back upon me took a flower from the table and commenced to pull from it its petals
i unsheathed my sword and seating myself began to polish away a speck of rust upon the blade
ten minutes later i looked up from the task to receive full in my face a red rose tossed from the other side of the room
the missile was followed by an enchanting burst of laughter
we cannot afford to quarrel can we cried mistress jocelyn percy
life is sad enough in this solitude without that
nothing but trees and water all day long and not a soul to speak to
and i am horribly afraid of the indians
what if they were to kill me while you were away
you know you swore before the minister to protect me
you won't leave me to the mercies of the savages will you
and i may go to jamestown may n't i
i want to go to church
i want to go to the governor's house
i want to buy a many things
i have gold in plenty and but this one decent dress
you'll take me with you won't you  there's not your like in virginia i told her
if you go to town clad like that and with that bearing there will be talk enough
and ships come and go and there are those besides rolfe who have been to london  for a moment the laughter died from her eyes and lips but it returned
let them talk she said
what care i
and i do not think your ship captains your traders and adventurers do often dine with my lord bishop
this barbarous forest world and another world that i wot of are so far apart that the inhabitants of the one do not trouble those of the other
in that petty village down there i am safe enough
besides sir you wear a sword  my sword is ever at your service madam  then i may go to jamestown  if you will it so  with her bright eyes upon me and with one hand softly striking a rose against her laughing lips she extended the other hand
you may kiss it if you wish sir she said demurely
i knelt and kissed the white fingers and four days later we went to jamestown
chapter vi in which we go to jamestown   it was early morning when we set out on horseback for jamestown
i rode in front with mistress percy upon a pillion behind me and diccon on the brown mare brought up the rear
the negress and the mails i had sent by boat
now a ride through the green wood with a noble horse beneath you and around you the freshness of the morn is pleasant enough
each twig had its row of diamonds and the wet leaves that we pushed aside spilled gems upon us
the horses set their hoofs daintily upon fern and moss and lush grass
in the purple distances deer stood at gaze the air rang with innumerable bird notes clear and sweet squirrels chattered bees hummed and through the thick leafy roof of the forest the sun showered gold dust
and mistress jocelyn percy was as merry as the morning
it was now fourteen days since she and i had first met and in that time i had found in her thrice that number of moods
she could be as gay and sweet as the morning as dark and vengeful as the storms that came up of afternoons pensive as the twilight stately as the nightin her there met a hundred minds
also she could be childishly frankand tell you nothing
today she chose to be gracious
ten times in an hour diccon was off his horse to pluck this or that flower that her white forefinger pointed out
she wove the blooms into a chaplet and placed it upon her head she filled her lap with trailers of the vine that swayed against us and stained her fingers and lips with the berries diccon brought her she laughed at the squirrels at the scurrying partridges at the turkeys that crossed our path at the fish that leaped from the brooks at old jocomb and his sons who ferried us across the chickahominy
she was curious concerning the musket i carried and when in an open space in the wood we saw an eagle perched upon a blasted pine she demanded my pistol
i took it from my belt and gave it to her with a laugh
i will eat all of your killing i said
she aimed the weapon
a wager she declared
there be mercers in jamestown
if i hit thou 'lt buy me a pearl hatband  two  she fired and the bird rose with a scream of wrath and sailed away
but two or three feathers came floating to the ground and when diccon had brought them to her she pointed triumphantly to the blood upon them
you said two she cried
the sun rose higher and the heat of the day set in
mistress percy's interest in forest bloom and creature flagged
instead of laughter we had sighs at the length of way the vines slid from her lap and she took the faded flowers from her head and cast them aside
she talked no more and by and by i felt her head droop against my shoulder
madam is asleep said diccon's voice behind me
ay i answered
she'll find a jack of mail but a hard pillow
and look to her that she does not fall  i had best walk beside you then he said
i nodded and he dismounted and throwing the mare's bridle over his arm strode on beside us with his hand upon the frame of the pillion
ten minutes passed the last five of which i rode with my face over my shoulder
diccon i cried at last sharply
he came to his senses with a start
ay sir he questioned his face dark red
suppose you look at me for a change i said
how long since dale came in diccon  ten years sir  before we enter jamestown we'll pass through a certain field and beneath a certain tree
do you remember what happened there some years ago  i am not like to forget sir
you saved me from the wheel  upon which you were bound ready to be broken for drunkenness gaming and loose living
i begged your life from dale for no other reason i think than that you had been a horseboy in my old company in the low countries
god wot the life was scarcely worth the saving  i know it sir  dale would not let you go scotfree but would sell you into slavery
at your own entreaty i bought you since when you have served me indifferently well
you have showed small penitence for past misdeeds and your amendment hath been of yet lesser bulk
a hardy rogue thou wast born and a rogue thou wilt remain to the end of time
but we have lived and hunted fought and bled together and in our own fashion i think we bear each other good willeven some love
i have winked at much have shielded you in much perhaps
in return i have demanded one thing which if you had not given i would have found you another dale to deal with  have i ever refused it my captain  not yet
take your hand from that pillion and hold it up then say after me these words 'this lady is my mistress my master's wife to be by me reverenced as such
her face is not for my eyes nor her hand for my lips
if i keep not myself clean of all offense toward her may god approve that which my master shall do
'  the blood rushed to his face
i watched his fingers slowly loosening their grasp
tardy obedience is of the house of mutiny i said sternly
will you sirrah or will you not  he raised his hand and repeated the words
now hold her as before i ordered and straightening myself in the saddle rode on with my eyes once more on the path before me
a mile further on mistress percy stirred and raised her head from my shoulder
not at jamestown yet she sighed as yet but half awake
oh the endless trees
i dreamed i was hawking at windsor and then suddenly i was here in this forest a bird happy because i was free and then a falcon came swooping down upon meit had me in its talons and i changed to myself again and it changed towhat am i saying
i am talking in my sleep
who is that singing  in fact from the woods in front of us and not a bowshot away rang out a powerful voice      'in the merry month of may       in a morn by break of day       with a troop of damsels playing  forth i went forsooth amaying' and presently the trees thinning in front of us we came upon a little open glade and upon the singer
he lay on his back on the soft turf beneath an oak with his hands clasped behind his head and his eyes upturned to the blue sky showing between leaf and branch
on one knee crossed above the other sat a squirrel with a nut in its paws and half a dozen others scampered here and there over his great body like so many frolicsome kittens
at a little distance grazed an old horse gray and gaunt springhalt and spavined with ribs like death's own
its saddle and bridle adorned a limb of the oak
the song went cheerfully on      'much ado there was god wot       would love and she would not       said never man was true       he said none was false to you  give you goodday reverend sir i called
art conning next sunday's hymn  nothing abashed master jeremy sparrow gently shook off the squirrels and getting to his feet advanced to meet us
a toy he declared with a wave of his hand a trifle a silly old song that came into my mind unawares the leaves being so green and the sky so blue
had you come a little earlier or a little later you would have heard the ninetieth psalm
give you goodday madam
i must have sung for that the very queen of may was coming by  art on your way to jamestown i demanded
come ride with us
diccon saddle his reverence's horse  saddle him an thou wilt friend said master sparrow for he and i have idled long enough but i fear i cannot keep pace with this fair company
i and the horse are footing it together  he is not long for this world i remarked eyeing his illfavored steed but neither are we far from jamestown
he'll last that far  master sparrow shook his head with a rueful countenance
i bought him from one of the french vignerons below westover he said
the fellow was astride the poor creature beating him with a club because he could not go
i laid monsieur crapaud in the dust after which we compounded he for my purse i for the animal since when the poor beast and i have tramped it together for i could not in conscience ride him
have you read me aesop's fables captain percy  i remember the man the boy and the ass i replied
the ass came to grief in the end
put thy scruples in thy pocket man and mount thy pale horse  not i he said with a smile
't is a thousand pities captain percy that a small mean and squeamish spirit like mine should be cased like a very guy of warwick
now if i were slight of body or even if i were no heavier than your servant there  oh i said
diccon give his reverence the mare and do you mount his horse and bring him slowly on to town
if he will not carry you you can lead him in  sunshine revisited the countenance of master jeremy sparrow he swung his great body into the saddle gathered up the reins and made the mare to caracole across the path for very joy
have a care of the poor brute friend he cried genially to diccon whose looks were of the sulkiest
bring him gently on and leave him at master bucke's near to the church  what do you do at jamestown i asked as we passed from out the glade into the gloom of a pine wood
i was told that you were gone to henricus to help master thorpe convert the indians  ay he answered i did go
i had a calli was sure i had a call
i thought of myself as a very apostle to the gentiles
i went from henricus one day's journey into the wilderness with none but an indian lad for interpreter and coming to an indian village gathered its inhabitants about me and sitting down upon a hillock read and expounded to them the sermon on the mount
i was much edified by the solemnity of their demeanor and the earnestness of their attention and had conceived great hopes for their spiritual welfare when the reading and exhortation being finished one of their old men arose and made me a long speech which i could not well understand but took to be one of grateful welcome to myself and my tidings of peace and good will
he then desired me to tarry with them and to be present at some entertainment or other the nature of which i could not make out
i tarried and toward evening they conducted me with much ceremony to an open space in the midst of the village
there i found planted in the ground a thick stake and around it a ring of flaming brushwood
to the stake was fastened an indian warrior captured so my interpreter informed me from some hostile tribe above the falls
his arms and ankles were secured to the stake by means of thongs passed through incisions in the flesh his body was stuck over with countless pine splinters each burning like a miniature torch and on his shaven crown was tied a thin plate of copper heaped with redhot coals
a little to one side appeared another stake and another circle of brushwood the one with nothing tied to it as yet and the other still unlit
my friend i did not tarry to see it lit
i tore a branch from an oak and i became as samson with the jaw bone of the ass
i fell upon and smote those philistines
their wretched victim was beyond all human help but i dearly avenged him upon his enemies
and they had their pains for naught when they planted that second stake and laid the brush for their hell fire
at last i dropped into the stream upon which their damnable village was situate and got safely away
next day i went to george thorpe and resigned my ministry telling him that we were nowhere commanded to preach to devils when the company was ready to send shot and steel amongst them they might count upon me
after which i came down the river to jamestown where i found worthy master bucke wellnigh despaired of with the fever
finally he was taken up river for change of air and for lack of worthier substitute the governor and captain west constrained me to remain and minister to the shepherdless flock
where will you lodge good sir  i do not know i said
the town will be full and the guest house is not yet finished  why not come to me he asked
there are none in the minister's house but me and goodwife allen who keeps it
there are five fair large rooms and a goodly garden though the trees do too much shadow the house
if you will come and let the sunshine ina bow and smile for madami shall be your debtor  his plea pleased me well
except the governor's and captain west's the minister's house was the best in the town
it was retired too being set in its own grounds and not upon the street and i desired privacy
goodwife allen was stolid and incurious
moreover i liked master jeremy sparrow
i accepted his hospitality and gave him thanks
he waved them away and fell to complimenting mistress percy who was pleased to be gracious to us both
well content for the moment with the world and ourselves we fared on through the alternating sunshine and shade and were happy with the careless inhabitants of the forest
oversoon we came to the peninsula and crossed the neck of land
before us lay the town to the outer eye a poor and mean village indeed but to the inner the stronghold and capital of our race in the western world the germ from which might spring stately cities the newborn babe which might in time equal its parent in stature strength and comeliness
so i and a few besides both in virginia and at home viewed the mean houses the poor church and rude fort and loved the spot which had witnessed much suffering and small joy but which held within it the future which was even now a bit in the mouth of spain a thing in itself outweighing all the toil and anguish of our planting
but there were others who saw only the meanness of the place its almost defenselessness its fluxes and fevers the fewness of its inhabitants and the number of its graves
finding no gold and no earthly paradise and that in the sweat of their brow they must eat their bread they straightway fell into the dumps and either died out of sheer perversity or went yelping home to the company with all manner of dismal taleswhich tales through my lord warwick's good offices never failed to reach the sacred ears of his majesty and to bring the colony and the company into disfavor
we came to the palisade and found the gates wide open and the warder gone
where be the people marveled master sparrow as we rode through into the street
in truth where were the people
on either side of the street the doors of the houses stood open but no person looked out from them or loitered on the doorsteps the square was empty there were no women at the well no children underfoot no gaping crowd before gaol and pillory no guard before the governor's housenot a soul high or low to be seen
have they all migrated cried sparrow
are they gone to croatan  they have left one to tell the tale then i said for here he comes running    chapter vii in which we prepare to fight the spaniard   a man came panting down the street
captain ralph percy he cried
my master said it was your horse coming across the neck
the governor commands your attendance at once sir  where is the governor
where are all the people i demanded
at the fort
they are all at the fort or on the bank below
oh sirs a woeful day for us all  a woeful day i exclaimed
what's the matter  the man whom i recognized as one of the commander's servants a fellow with the soul of a french valet de chambre was wild with terror
they are at the guns he quavered
alackaday
what can a few sakers and demiculverins do against them  against whom i cried
they are giving out pikes and cutlasses
woe's me the sight of naked steel hath ever made me sick  i drew my dagger and flashed it before him
does 't make you sick i asked
you shall be sicker yet if you do not speak to some purpose  the fellow shrank back his eyeballs starting from his head
it's a tall ship he gasped a very big ship
it hath ten culverins beside fowlers and murderers sabers falcons and bases  i took him by the collar and shook him off his feet
there are priests on board he managed to say as i set him down
this time tomorrrow we'll all be on the rack
and next week the galleys will have us  it's the spaniard at last i said
come on  when we reached the river bank before the fort it was to find confusion worse confounded
the gates of the palisade were open and through them streamed councilors burgesses and officers while the bank itself was thronged with the generality
ancient planters smith's men dale's men tenants and servants women and children including the little eyases we imported the year before negroes paspaheghs french vignerons dutch sawmill men italian glassworkersall seethed to and fro all talked at once and all looked down the river
out of the babel of voices these words came to us over and over the spaniard the inquisition the galleys they were the words oftenest heard at that time when strange sails hove in sight
but where was the spaniard
on the river hugging the shore were many small craft barges shallops sloops and pinnaces and beyond them the masts of the truelove the due return and the tiger then in port on these three of which the largest the due return was of but eighty tons burthen the mariners were running about and the masters bawling orders
but there was no other ship no bark galleon or manofwar with three tiers of grinning ordnance and the hated yellow flag flaunting above
i sprang from my horse and leaving it and mistress percy in sparrow's charge hastened up to the fort
as i passed through the palisade i heard my name called and turning waited for master pory to come up
he was panting and puffing his jovial face very red
i was across the neck of land when i heard the news he said
i ran all the way and am somewhat scant of breath
here's the devil to pay  it looks another mare'snest i replied
we have cried 'spaniard'
pretty often  but this time the wolf's here he answered
davies sent a horseman at a gallop from algernon with the tidings
he passed the ship and it was a very great one
we may thank this dead calm that it did not catch us unawares  within the palisade was noise enough but more order than without
on the halfmoons commanding the river gunners were busy about our sakers falcons and three culverins
in one place west the commander was giving out brigandines jacks skulls muskets halberds swords and longbows in another his wife who was a very mary ambree supervised the boiling of a great caldron of pitch
each loophole in palisade and fort had already its marksman
through the west port came a horde of reluctant invaderscattle swine and poultrydriven in by yelling boys
i made my way through the press to where i saw the governor surrounded by councilors and burgesses sitting on a keg of powder and issuing orders at the top of his voice
ha captain percy he cried as i came up
you are in good time man
you've served your apprenticeship at the wars
you must teach us how to beat the dons  to englishmen that comes by nature sir i said
art sure we are to have the pleasure  not a doubt of it this time he answered
the ship slipped in past the point last night
davies signaled her to stop and then sent a ball over her but she kept on
true it was too dark to make out much but if she were friendly why did she not stop for castle duties
moreover they say she was of at least five hundred tons and no ship of that size hath ever visited these waters
there was no wind and they sent a man on at once hoping to outstrip the enemy and warn us
the man changed horses at basse's choice and passed the ship about dawn
all he could tell for the mist was that it was a very great ship with three tiers of guns  the flag  she carried none  humph i said
it hath a suspicious look
at least we do well to be ready
we'll give them a warm welcome  there are those here who counsel surrender continued the governor
there's one at least who wants the tiger sent downstream with a white flag and my sword  where i cried
he's no englishman i warrant  as much an englishman as thou sir called out a gentleman whom i had encountered before to wit master edward sharpless
it's well enough for swingebuckler captains low country fireeaters to talk of holding out againt a spanish manofwar with twice our number of fighting men and enough ordnance to batter the town out of existence
wise men know when the odds are too heavy  it's well enough for lilylivered goosefleshed lawyers to hold their tongues when men and soldiers talk i retorted
we are not making indentures to the devil and so have no need of such gentry  there was a roar of laughter from the captains and gunners but terror of the spaniard had made master edward sharpless bold to all besides
they will wipe us off the face of the earth he lamented
there won't be an englishman left in america
they'll come close in upon us
they'll batter down the fort with their culverins they'll turn all their swivels sakers and falcons upon us they'll throw into our midst stinkpots and grenades they'll mow us down with chain shot
their gunners never miss his voice rose to a scream and he shook as with an ague
are you mad
it's spain that's to be fought
spain the rich
spain the powerful
spain the lord of the new world  it's england that fights i cried
for very shame hold thy tongue  if we surrender at once they'll let us go he whined
we can take the small boats and get to the bermudas they'll let us go  into the galleys muttered west
the craven tried another feint
think of the women and children  we do i said sternly
silence fool  the governor a brave and honest man rose from the keg of powder
all this is foreign to the matter master sharpless
i think our duty is clear be the odds what they may
this is our post and we will hold it or die beside it
we are few in number but we are england in america and i think we will remain here
this is the king's fifth kingdom and we will keep it for him
we will trust in the lord and fight it out  amen i said and amen said the ring of councilors and burgesses and the armed men beyond
the hum of voices now rose into excited cries and the watchman stationed atop the big culverin called out sail ho with one accord we turned our faces downstream
there was the ship undoubtedly
moreover a strong breeze had sprung up blowing from the sea filling her white sails and rapidly lessening the distance between us
as yet we could only tell that she was indeed a large ship with all sail set
through the gates of the palisade now came pellmell the crowd without
in ten minutes' time the women were in line ready to load the muskets the children sheltered as best they might be the men in ranks the gunners at their guns and the flag up
i had run it up with my own hand and as i stood beneath the folds master sparrow and my wife came to my side
the women are over there i said to the latter where you had best betake yourself  i prefer to stay here she answered
i am not afraid her color was high and she held her head up
my father fought the armada she said
get me a sword from that man who is giving them out  from his coign of vantage the watch now called out she's a long shipfive hundred tons anyhow
lord
the metal that she carries
she's rasedecked  then she's spanish sure enough cried the governor
from the crowd of servants felons and foreigners rose a great clamor and presently we made out sharpless perched on a cask in their midst and wildly gesticulating
the tiger the truelove and the due return have swung across channel  announced the watch
they 've trained their guns on the spaniard  the englishmen cheered but the bastard crew about sharpless groaned
extreme fear had made the lawyer shameless
what guns have those boats he screamed
two falcons apiece and a handful of muskets and they go out against a manofwar
she'll trample them underfoot
she'll sink them with a shot apiece
the tiger is forty tons and the truelove is sixty
you 're all mad  sometimes quality beats quantity said west
didst ever hear of the content sang out a gunner
or of the merchant royal cried another
or of the revenge quoth master jeremy sparrow
go hang thyself coward or if you choose swim out to the spaniard and shift from thy wet doublet and hose into a sanbenito
let the don come shoot if he can and land if he will
we'll singe his beard in virginia as we did at cales
'the great st philip the pride of the spaniards       was burnt to the bottom and sunk in the sea
the st andrew and eke the st matthew       we took in fight manfully and brought away'
and so we'll do with this one my masters
we'll sink her or we'll take her and send her against her own galleons and galleasses
'dubadub dubadub thus strike their drums      tantara tantara the englishman comes
'  his great voice and great presence seized and held the attention of all
over his doublet of rusty black he had clapped a yet rustier back and breast on his bushy hair rode a headpiece many sizes too small by his side was an old broadsword and over his shoulder a pike
suddenly from gay hardihood his countenance changed to an expression more befitting his calling
our cause is just my masters he cried
we stand here not for england alone we stand for the love of law for the love of liberty for the fear of god who will not desert his servants and his cause nor give over to antichrist this virgin world
this plantation is the leaven which is to leaven the whole lump and surely he will hide it in the hollow of his hand and in the shadow of his wing
god of battles hear us
god of england god of america aid the children of the one the saviors of the other  he had dropped the pike to raise his clasped hands to the blue heavens but now he lifted it again threw back his shoulders and flung up his head
he laid his hand on the flagstaff and looked up to the banner streaming in the breeze
it looks well so high against the blue does n't it friends he cried genially
suppose we keep it there forever and a day  a cheer arose so loud that it silenced if it did not convince the craven few
as for master edward sharpless he disappeared behind the line of women
the great ship came steadily on her white sails growing larger and larger moment by moment her tiers of guns more distinct and menacing her whole aspect more defiant
her waist seemed packed with men
but no streamers no flag
a puff of smoke floated up from the deck of the tiger and a ball from one of her two tiny falcons passed through the stranger's rigging
a cheer for the brave little cockboat arose from the english
david and his pebble exclaimed master jeremy sparrow
now for goliath's twentypounders  but no flame and thunder issued from the guns aboard the stranger
instead from her deck there came to us what sounded mightily like a roar of laughter
suddenly from each masthead and yard shot out streamers of red and blue up from the poop rose and flaunted in the wind the crosses of st george and st andrew and with a crash trumpet drum and fife rushed into       here's to jolly good ale and old  by the lord she's english shouted the governor
on she came banners flying music playing and inextinguishable laughter rising from her decks
the tiger the truelove and the due return sent no more hailstones against her they turned and resolved themselves into her consort
the watch a grim old sea dog that had come in with dale swung himself down from his post and came toward the governor at a run
i know her now sir he shouted
i was at the winning of cales and she's the santa teresa that we took and sent home to the queen
she was spanish once sir but she's english now  the gates were flung open and the excited people poured out again upon the river bank
i found myself beside the governor whose honest countenance wore an expression of profound bewilderment
what d' ye make of her percy he said
the company does n't send servants felons 'prentices or maids in such craft no nor officers or governors either
it's the king's ship sure enough but what is she doing herethat 's the question
what does she want and whom does she bring  we'll soon know i answered for there goes her anchor  five minutes later a boat was lowered from the ship and came swiftly toward us
the boat had four rowers and in the stern sat a tall man blackbearded highcolored and magnificently dressed
it touched the sand some two hundred feet from the spot where governor councilors officers and a sprinkling of other sorts stood staring at it and at the great ship beyond
the man in the stern leaped out looked around him and then walked toward us
as he walked slowly we had leisure to note the richness of his doublet and cloakthe one slashed the other lined with scarlet taffetathe arrogance of his mien and gait and the superb fullblooded beauty of his face
the handsomest man that ever i saw ejaculated the governor
master pory standing beside him drew in his breath then puffed it out again
handsome enough your honor he said unless handsome is as handsome does
that gentlemen is my lord carnalthat is the king's latest favorite    chapter viii in which enters my lord carnal   i felt a touch upon my shoulder and turned to find mistress percy beside me
her cheeks were white her eyes aflame her whole frame tense
the passion that dominated her was so clearly anger at white heat that i stared at her in amazement
her hand slid from my shoulder to the bend of my arm and rested there
remember that i am your wife sir  she said in a low fierce voiceyour kind and loving wife
you said that your sword was mine now bring your wit to the same service  there was not time to question her meaning
the man whose position in the realm had just been announced by the secretary and of whom we had all heard as one not unlikely to supplant even buckingham himself was close at hand
the governor headpiece in hand stepped forward the other swept off his spanish hat both bowed profoundly
i speak to his honor the governor of virginia inquired the newcomer
his tone was offhand his hat already back upon his head
i am george yeardley at my lord carnal's service answered the governor
the favorite raised his eyebrows
i don't need to introduce myself it seems he said
you've found that i am not the devil after allat least not the spanish apollyon
zooks
a hawk above a poultry yard could n't have caused a greater commotion than did my poor little ship and my few poor birding pieces
does every strange sail so put you through your paces  the governor's color mounted
we are not at home he answered stiffly
here we are few and weak and surrounded by many dangers and have need to be vigilant being planted as it were in the very grasp of that spain who holds europe in awe and who claims this land as her own
that we are here at all is proof enough of our courage my lord  the other shrugged his shoulders
i don't doubt your mettle he said negligently
i dare say it matches your armor  his glance had rested for a moment upon the battered headpiece and ancient rusty breastplate with which master jeremy sparrow was bedight
it is something antique truly something out of fashion remarked that worthyalmost as out of fashion as courtesy from guests or respect for dignities from myfaceismyfortune minions and lords on carpet considerations  the hush of consternation following this audacious speech was broken by a roar of laughter from the favorite himself
zounds he cried your courage is worn on your sleeve good giant
i'll uphold you to face spaniards strappado rack galleys and all  the bravado with which he spoke the insolence of his bold glance and curled lip the arrogance with which he flaunted that king's favor which should be a brand more infamous than the hangman's his beauty the pomp of his dressall were alike hateful
i hated him then scarce knowing why as i hated him afterward with reason
he now pulled from the breast of his doublet a packet which he proffered the governor
from the king sir he announced in the halffierce halfmocking tone he had made his own
you may read it at your leisure
he wishes you to further me in a quest upon which i have come  the governor took the packet with reverence
his majesty's will is our law he said
anything that lies in our power sir though if you come for gold  the favorite laughed again
i've come for a thing a deal more precious sir governora thing worth more to me than all the treasure of the indies with manoa and el dorado thrown into wit the thing upon which i've set my mind
that which i determine to do i do sir and the thing i determine to have why sooner or later by hook or by crook fair means or foul i have it
i am not one to be crossed or defied with impunity  i do not take your meaning my lord said the governor puzzled but courteous
there are none here who would care to thwart in any honorable enterprise a nobleman so high in the king's favor
i trust that my lord carnal will make my poor house his own during his stay in virginiawhat's the matter my lord  my lord's face was dark red his black eyes afire his mustaches working up and down
his white teeth had closed with a click on the loud oath which had interrupted the governor's speech
honest sir george and his circle stared at this unaccountable guest in amazement not unmixed with dismay
as for myself i knew before he spoke what had caused the oath and the fierce triumph in that handsome face
master jeremy sparrow had moved a little to one side thus exposing to view that which his great body had before screened from observationnamely mistress jocelyn percy
in a moment the favorite was before her hat in hand bowing to the ground
my quest hath ended where i feared it but begun he cried flushed and exultant
i have found my manoa sooner than i thought for
have you no welcome for me lady  she withdrew her arm from mine and curtsied to him profoundly then stood erect indignant and defiant her eyes angry stars her cheeks carnation scorn on her smiling lips
i cannot welcome you as you should be welcomed my lord she said in a clear voice
i have but my bare hands
manoa my lord lies far to the southward
this land is quite out of your course and you will find here but your travail for your pains
my lord permit me to present to you my husband captain ralph percy
i think that you know his cousin my lord of northumberland  the red left the favorite's cheeks and he moved as though a blow had been dealt him by some invisible hand
recovering himself he bowed to me and i to him which done we looked each other in the eyes long enough for each to see the thrown gauntlet
i raise it i said
and i raise it he answered
a l'outrance i think sir i continued
a l'outrance he assented
and between us two alone i suggested
his answering smile was not good to see nor was the tone in which he spoke to the governor good to hear
it is now some weeks sir he said since there disappeared from court a jewel a diamond of most inestimable worth
it in some sort belonged to the king and his majesty in the goodness of his heart had promised it to a certain onenay had sworn by his kingdom that it should be his
well sir that man put forth his hand to claim his ownwhen lo
the jewel vanished
where it went no man could tell
there was as you may believe a mighty running up and down and looking into dark corners all for naughtit was clean gone
but the man to whom that bright gem had been promised was not one easily hoodwinked or baffled
he swore to trace it follow it find it and wear it  his bold eyes left the governor to rest upon the woman beside me had he pointed to her with his hand he could not have more surely drawn upon her the regard of that motley throng
by degrees the crowd had fallen back leaving us threethe king's minion the masquerading lady and myselfthe centre of a ring of staring faces but now she became the sole target at which all eyes were directed
in virginia at this time the women of our own race were held in high esteem
during the first years of our planting they were a greater rarity than the mockingbirds and flying squirrels or than that weed the eating of which made fools of men
the man whose wife was loving and daring enough or jealous enough of indian maids to follow him into the wilderness counted his friends by the score and never lacked for company
the first marriage in virginia was between a laborer and a waiting maid and yet there was as great a deal of candy stuff as if it had been the nuptials of a lieutenant of the shire
the brother of my lord de la warre stood up with the groom the brother of my lord of northumberland gave away the bride and was the first to kiss her and the president himself held the caudle to their lips that night
since that wedding there had been others
gentlewomen made the virginia voyage with husband or father women signed as servants and came over to marry in three weeks' time the husband paying good tobacco for the wife's freedom in the cargoes of children sent for apprentices there were many girls
and last but not least had come sir edwyn's doves
things had changed since that dayat the memory of which men still held their sideswhen madam west then the only woman in the town with youth and beauty had marched down the street to the pillory mounted it called to her the drummer and ordered him to summon to the square by tuck of drum every man in the place
which done and the amazed population at hand gaping at the spectacle of the wife of their commander then absent from home pilloried before them she gave command through the crier that they should take their fill of gazing whispering and nudging then and there forever and a day and then should go about their business and give her leave to mind her own
that day was gone but men still dropped their work to see a woman pass still cheered when a farthingale appeared over a ship's side and at church still devoted their eyes to other service than staring at the minister
in our short but crowded history few things had made a greater stir than the coming in of sir edwyn's maids
they were married now but they were still the observed of all observers to be pointed out to strangers run after by children gaped at by the vulgar bowed to with broad smiles by burgess councilor and commander and openly contemned by those dames who had attained to a husband in somewhat more regular fashion
of the ninety who had arrived two weeks before the greater number had found husbands in the town itself or in the neighboring hundreds so that in the crowd that had gathered to withstand the spaniard and had stayed to welcome the king's favorite there were farthingales not a few
but there were none like the woman whose hand i had kissed in the courting meadow
in the throng that day in her puritan dress and amid the crowd of meaner beauties she had passed without overmuch comment and since that day none had seen her save rolfe and the minister my servants and myself and when the spaniard was cried men thought of other things than the beauty of women so that until this moment she had escaped any special notice
now all that was changed
the governor following the pointing of those insolent eyes fixed his own upon her in a stare of sheer amazement the goldlaced quality about him craned necks lifted eyebrows and whispered and the rabble behind followed their betters' example with an emphasis quite their own
where do you suppose that jewel went sir governor said the favoritethat jewel which was overnice to shine at court which set up its will against the king's which would have none of that one to whom it had been given  i am a plain man my lord replied the governor bluntly
an it please you give me plain words  my lord laughed his eyes traveling round the ring of greedily intent faces
so be it sir he assented
may i ask who is this lady  she came in the bonaventure answered the governor
she was one of the treasurer's poor maids  with whom i trod a measure at court not long ago said the favorite
i had to wait for the honor until the prince had been gratified  the governor's round eyes grew rounder
young hamor atiptoe behind him drew a long low whistle
in so small a community went on my lord sure you must all know one another
there can be no masks worn no false colors displayed
everything must be as open as daylight
but we all have a past as well as a present
now for instance  i interrupted him
in virginia my lord we live in the present
at present my lord i like not the color of your lordship's cloak  he stared at me with his black brows drawn together
it is not of your choosing nor for your wearing sir he rejoined haughtily
and your sword knot is villainously tied i continued
and i like not such a firenew bejeweled scabbard
mine you see is out at heel  i see he said dryly
the pinking of your doublet suits me not either i declared
i could make it more to my liking and i touched his genoa threepile with the point of my rapier
a loud murmur arose from the crowd and the governor started forward crying out captain percy
are you mad  i was never saner in my life sir i answered
french fashions like me notthat is allnor englishmen that wear them
to my thinking such are scarcely trueborn  that thrust went home
all the world knew the story of my late lord carnal and the waiting woman in the service of the french ambassador's wife
a gasp of admiration went up from the crowd
my lord's rapier was out the hand that held it shaking with passion
i had my blade in my hand but the point was upon the ground
i'll lesson you you madman  he said thickly
suddenly without any warning he thrust at me had he been less blind with rage the long score which each was to run up against the other might have ended where it began
i swerved and the next instant with my own point sent his rapier whirling
it fell at the governor's feet
your lordship may pick it up i remarked
your grasp is as firm as your honor my lord  he glared at me foam upon his lips
men were between us nowthe governor francis west master pory hamor wynneand a babel of excited voices arose
the diversion i had aimed to make had been made with a vengeance
west had me by the arm
what a murrain is all this coil about ralph percy
if you hurt hair of his head you are lost  the favorite broke from the governor's detaining hand and conciliatory speech
you'll fight sir he cried hoarsely
you know that i need not now my lord i answered
he stamped upon the ground with rage and shame not true shame for that foul thrust but shame for the sword upon the grass for that which could be read in men's eyes strive to hide it as they might for the open scorn upon one face
then during the minute or more in which we faced each other in silence he exerted to some effect that will of which he had boasted
the scarlet faded from his face his frame steadied and he forced a smile
also he called to his aid a certain soldierly honestseeming frankness of speech and manner which he could assume at will
your virginian sunshine dazzleth the eyes sir he said
of a verity it made me think you on guard
forgive me my mistake  i bowed
your lordship will find me at your service
i lodge at the minister's house where your lordship's messenger will find me
i am going there now with my wife who hath ridden a score of miles this morning and is weary
we give you goodday my lord  i bowed to him again and to the governor then gave my hand to mistress percy
the crowd opening before us we passed through it and crossed the parade by the west bulwark
at the further end was a bit of rising ground
this we mounted then before descending the other side into the lane leading to the minister's house we turned as by one impulse and looked back
life is like one of those endless italian corridors painted picture after picture by a master hand and man is the traveler through it taking his eyes from one scene but to rest them upon another
some remain a blur in his mind some he remembers not for some he has but to close his eyes and he sees them again line for line tint for tint the whole spirit of the piece
i close my eyes and i see the sunshine hot and bright the blue of the skies the sheen of the river
the sails are white again upon boats long lost the santa teresa sunk in a fight with an algerine rover two years afterward rides at anchor there forever in the james her crew in the waist and the rigging her master and his mates on the poop above them the flag
i see the plain at our feet and the crowd beyond all staring with upturned faces and standing out from the group of perplexed and wondering dignitaries a man in black and scarlet one hand busy at his mouth the other clenched upon the newly restored and unsheathed sword
and i see standing on the green hillock hand in hand us two myself and the woman so near to me and yet so far away that a common enemy seemed our only tie
we turned and descended to the green lane and the deserted houses
when we were quite hidden from those we had left on the bank below the fort she dropped my hand and moved to the other side of the lane and thus with never a word to spare we walked sedately on until we reached the minister's house
chapter ix in which two drink of one cup   waiting for us in the doorway we found master jeremy sparrow relieved of his battered armor his face wreathed with hospitable smiles and a posy in his hand
when the spaniard turned out to be only the king's minion i slipped away to see that all was in order he said genially
here are roses madam that you are not to treat as you did those others  she took them from him with a smile and we went into the house to find three fair large rooms something bare of furnishing but clean and sweet with here and there a bow pot of newly gathered flowers a dish of wardens on the table and a cool air laden with the fragrance of the pine blowing through the open window
this is your demesne quoth the minister
i have worthy master bucke's own chamber upstairs
ah good man i wish he may quickly recover his strength and come back to his own and so relieve me of the burden of all this luxury
i whom nature meant for an eremite have no business in kings' chambers such as these  his devout faith in his own distaste for soft living and his longings after a hermit's cell was an edifying spectacle
so was the evident pride which he took in his domain the complacence with which he pointed out the shady wellstocked garden and the delight with which he produced and set upon the table a huge pasty and a flagon of wine
it is a fast day with me he said
i may neither eat nor drink until the sun goes down
the flesh is a strong giant very full of pride and lust of living and the spirit must needs keep watch and ward seizing every opportunity to mortify and deject its adversary
goodwife allen is still gaping with the crowd at the fort and your man and maid have not yet come but i shall be overhead if you need aught
mistress percy must want rest after her ride  he was gone leaving us two alone together
she stood opposite me beside the window from which she had not moved since entering the room
the color was still in her cheeks the light in her eyes and she still held the roses with which sparrow had heaped her arms
i was moving to the table
wait she said and i turned toward her again
have you no questions to ask she demanded
i shook my head
none madam  i was the king's ward she cried
i bowed but spoke no word though she waited for me
if you will listen she said at last proudly and yet with a pleading sweetnessif you will listen i will tell you how it was that ithat i came to wrong you so  i am listening madam i replied
she stood against the light the roses pressed to her bosom her dark eyes upon me her head held high
my mother died when i was born my father years ago
i was the king's ward
while the queen lived she kept me with hershe loved me i think and the king too was kindwould have me sing to him and would talk to me about witchcraft and the scriptures and how rebellion to a king is rebellion to god
when i was sixteen and he tendered me marriage with a scotch lord i who loved the gentleman not never having seen him prayed the king to take the value of my marriage and leave me my freedom
he was so good to me then that the scotch lord was wed elsewhere and i danced at the wedding with a mind at ease
time passed and the king was still my very good lord
then one black day my lord carnal came to court and the king looked at him oftener than at his grace of buckingham
a few months and my lord's wish was the king's will
to do this new favorite pleasure he forgot his ancient kindness of heart yea and he made the law of no account
i was his kinswoman and under my full age he would give my hand to whom he chose
he chose to give it to my lord carnal  she broke off and turned her face from me toward the slant sunshine without the window
thus far she had spoken quietly with a certain proud patience of voice and bearing but as she stood there in a silence which i did not break the memory of her wrongs brought the crimson to her cheeks and the anger to her eyes
suddenly she burst forth passionately the king is the king
what is a subject's will to clash with his
what weighs a woman's heart against his whim
little cared he that my hand held back grew cold at the touch of that other hand in which he would have put it
what matter if my will was against that marriage
it was but the will of a girl and must be broken
all my world was with the king i who stood alone was but a woman young and untaught
oh they pressed me sore they angered me to the very heart
there was not one to fight my battle to help me in that strait to show me a better path than that i took
with all my heart with all my soul with all my might i hate that man which that ship brought here today
you know what i did to escape them all to escape that man
i fled from england in the dress of my waiting maid and under her name
i came to virginia in that guise
i let myself be put up appraised cried for sale in that meadow yonder as if i had been indeed the piece of merchandise i professed myself
the one man who approached me with respect i gulled and cheated
i let him a stranger give me his name
i shelter myself now behind his name
i have foisted on him my quarrel
i haveoh despise me if you will
you cannot despise me more than i despise myself  i stood with my hand upon the table and my eyes studying the shadow of the vines upon the floor
all that she said was perfectly true and yeti had a vision of a scarlet and black figure and a dark and beautiful face
i too hated my lord carnal
i do not despise you madam i said at last
what was done two weeks ago in the meadow yonder is past recall
let it rest
what is mine is yours it's little beside my sword and my name
the one is naturally at my wife's service for the other i have had some pride in keeping it untarnished
it is now in your keeping as well as my own
i do not fear to leave it there madam  i had spoken with my eyes upon the garden outside the window but now i looked at her to see that she was trembling in every limbtrembling so that i thought she would fall
i hastened to her
the roses she saidthe roses are too heavy
oh i am tiredand the room goes round  i caught her as she fell and laid her gently upon the floor
there was water on the table and i dashed some in her face and moistened her lips then turned to the door to get woman's help and ran against diccon
i got that bag of bones here at last sir he began
if ever ihis eyes traveled past me and he broke off
don't stand there staring i ordered
go bring the first woman you meet  is she dead he asked under his breath
have you killed her  killed her fool i cried
have you never seen a woman swoon  she looks like death he muttered
i thought  you thought i exclaimed
you have too many thoughts
begone and call for help  here is angela he said sullenly and without offering to move as light of foot soft of voice oxeyed and docile the black woman entered the room
when i saw her upon her knees beside the motionless figure the head pillowed on her arm her hand busy with the fastenings about throat and bosom her dark face as womanly tender as any english mother's bending over her nursling and when i saw my wife with a little moan creep further into the encircling arms i was satisfied
come away i said and followed by diccon went out and shut the door
my lord carnal was never one to let the grass grow beneath his feet
an hour later came his cartel borne by no less a personage than the secretary of the colony
i took it from the point of that worthy's rapier
it ran thus sirat what hour tomorrow and at what place do you prefer to die
and with what weapon shall i kill you  captain percy will give me credit for the profound reluctance with which i act in this affair against a gentleman and an officer so high in the esteem of the colony said master pory with his hand upon his heart
when i tell him that i once fought at paris in a duel of six on the same side with my late lord carnal and that when i was last at court my lord warwick did me the honor to present me to the present lord he will see that i could not well refuse when the latter requested my aid  master pory's disinterestedness is perfectly well known i said without a smile
if he ever chooses the stronger side sure he has strong reasons for so doing
he will oblige me by telling his principal that i ever thought sunrise a pleasant hour for dying and that there could be no fitter place than the field behind the church convenient as it is to the graveyard
as for weapons i have heard that he is a good swordsman but i have some little reputation that way myself
if he prefers pistols or daggers so be it  i think we may assume the sword said master pory
i bowed
you'll bring a friend he asked
i do not despair of finding one i answered though my second master secretary will put himself in some jeopardy  it is combat outrance i believe  i understand it so  then we'd better have bohun
the survivor may need his services  as you please i replied though my man diccon dresses my scratches well enough  he bit his lip but could not hide the twinkle in his eye
you are cocksure he said
curiously enough so is my lord
there are no further formalities to adjust i believe
tomorrow at sunrise behind the church and with rapiers  precisely  he slapped his blade back into its sheath
then that's over and done with for the nonce at least
sufficient unto the day etcetera
's life
i'm hot and dry
you've sacked cities ralph percy now sack me the minister's closet and bring out his sherris i'll be at charges for the next communion  we sat us down upon the doorstep with a tankard of sack between us and master pory drank and drank and drank again
how's the crop he asked
martin reports it poorer in quality than ever but sir george will have it that it is very varinas  it's every whit as good as the spanish i answered
you may tell my lord warwick so when next you write  he laughed
if he was a timeserver and leagued with my lord warwick's faction in the company he was a jovial sinner
traveler and student much of a philosopher more of a wit and boon companion to any beggar with a pottle of alewhile the drink lastedwe might look askance at his dealings but we liked his company passing well
if he took half a poor rustic's crop for his fee he was ready enough to toss him sixpence for drink money and if he made the tenants of the lands allotted to his office leave their tobacco uncared for whilst they rowed him on his innumerable roving expeditions up creeks and rivers he at least lightened their labors with most sidesplitting tales and with bottle songs learned in a thousand taverns
after tomorrow there'll be more interesting news to write he announced
you're a bold man captain percy  he looked at me out of the corners of his little twinkling eyes
i sat and smoked in silence
the king begins to dote upon him he said leans on his arm plays with his hand touches his cheek
buckingham stands by biting his lip his brow like a thundercloud
you'll find in tomorrow's antagonist ralph percy as potent a conjurer as your cousin hotspur found in glendower
he'll conjure you up the tower and a hanging drawing and quartering
who touches the king's favorite had safer touch the king
it's lesemajeste you contemplate  he lit his pipe and blew out a great cloud of smoke then burst into a roar of laughter
my lord high admiral may see you through
zooks
there'll be a rareeshow worth the penny behind the church tomorrow a percy striving with all his might and main to serve a villiers
eureka
there is something new under the sun despite the preacher he blew out another cloud of smoke
by this the tankard was empty and his cheeks were red his eyes moist and his laughter very ready
where's the lady jocelyn leigh he asked
may i not have the honor to kiss her hand before i go  i stared at him
i do not understand you i said coldly
there 's none within but mistress percy
she is weary and rests after her journey
we came from weyanoke this morning  he shook with laughter
ay ay brave it out he cried
it's what every man jack of us said you would do
but all's known man
the governor read the king's letters in full council an hour ago
she's the lady jocelyn leigh she 's a ward of the king's she and her lands are to wed my lord carnal  she was all that i replied
now she 's my wife  you'll find that the court of high commission will not agree with you  my rapier lay across my knees and i ran my hand down its worn scabbard
here 's one that agrees with me i said
and up there is another  and i lifted my hat
he stared
god and my good sword he cried
a very knightly dependence but not to be mentioned nowadays in the same breath with gold and the king's favor
better bend to the storm man sing low while it roars past
you can swear that you did n't know her to be of finer weave than dowlas
oh they'll call it in some sort a marriage for the lady's own sake but they'll find flaws enough to crack a thousand such mad matches
the divorce is the thing
there's precedent you know
a fair lady was parted from a brave man not a thousand years ago because a favorite wanted her
true frances howard wanted the favorite whilst this beauty of yours  you will please not couple the name of my wife with the name of that adulteress i interrupted fiercely
he started then cried out somewhat hurriedly no offense no offense
i meant no comparisons comparisons are odorous saith dogberry
all at court know the lady jocelyn leigh for a very britomart a maid as cold as dian  i rose and began to pace up and down the bit of green before the door
master pory i said at last coming to a stop before him if without breach of faith you can tell me what was said or done at the council today anent this matter you will lay me under an obligation that i shall not forget  he studied the lace on his sleeve in silence for a while then glanced up at me out of those small sly merry eyes
why he answered the king demands that the lady be sent home forthwith on the ship that gave us such a turn today in fact with a couple of women to attend her and under the protection of the only other passenger of quality to wit my lord carnal
his majesty cannot conceive it possible that she hath so far forgotten her birth rank and duty as to have maintained in virginia this mad masquerade throwing herself into the arms of any petty planter or broken adventurer who hath chanced to have an hundred and twenty pounds of filthy tobacco with which to buy him a wife
if she hath been so mad she is to be sent home none the less where she will be tenderly dealt with as one surely in this sole matter under the spell of witchcraft
the ship is to bring home alsoand in ironsthe man who married her
if he swears to have been ignorant of her quality and places no straws in the way of the king's commissioners then shall he be sent honorably back to virginia with enough in his hand to get him another wife
per contra if he erred with open eyes and if he remain contumacious he will have to deal with the king and with the court of high commission to say nothing of the king's favorite
that's the sum and substance ralph percy  why was my lord carnal sent i asked
probably because my lord carnal would come
he hath a will hath my lord and the king is more indulgent than eli to those upon whom he dotes
doubtless my lord high admiral sped him on his way gave him the king's best ship wished him a favorable windto hell  i was not ignorant that she was other than she seemed and i remain contumacious  then he said shamelessly you'll forgive me if in public at least i forswear your company
you're plaguespotted captain percy and your friends may wish you well but they must stay at home and burn juniper before their own doors  i'll forgive you i said when you 've told me what the governor will do  why there's the rub he answered
yeardley is the most obstinate man of my acquaintance
he who at his first coming beside a great deal of worth in his person brought only his sword hath grown to be as very a sir oracle among us as ever i saw
it's 'sir george says this' and 'sir george says that' and so there's an end on't
it's all because of that leave to cut your own throats in your own way that he brought you last year
sir george and sir edwyn
zooks
you had better dub them st george and st edwyn at once and be done with it
well on this occasion sir george stands up and says roundly with a good round oath to boot 'the king's commands have always come to us through the company
the company obeys the king we obey the company
his majesty's demand with reverence i speak it is out of all order
let the company through the treasurer command us to send captain percy home in irons to answer for this passing strange offense or to return willy nilly the lady who is now surely his wife and we will have no choice but to obey
until the company commands us we will do nothing nay we can do nothing'
and every one of my fellow councilors for myself i was busy with my pens saith 'my opinion sir george'
the upshot of it all is that the due return is to sail in two days with our humble representation to his majesty that though we bow to his lightest word as the leaf bows to the zephyr yet we are in this sole matter handfast compelled by his majesty's own gracious charter to refer our slightest official doing to that noble company which owes its very being to its rigid adherence to the terms of said charter
wherefore if his majesty will be graciously pleased to command us as usual through the said companyand so on
of course not a soul in the council or in jamestown or in virginia dreams of a duel behind the church at sunrise tomorrow he knocked the ashes from his pipe and by degrees got his fat body up from the doorstep
so there's a reprieve for you ralph percy unless you kill or are killed tomorrow morning
in the latter case the problem's solved in the former the best service you can do yourself and maybe the company is to walk out of the world of your own accord and that as quickly as possible
better a crossroads and a stake through a dead heart than a hangman's hands upon a live one  one moment i said
doth my lord carnal know of this decision of the governor's  ay and a fine passion it put him into
stormed and swore and threatened and put the governor's back up finely
it seems that he thought to 'bout ship tomorrow lady and all
he refuseth to go without the lady and so remaineth in virginia until he can have his will
lord
but buckingham would be a happy man if he were kept here forever and a day
my lord knows what he risks and he's in as black a humor as ever you saw
but i have striven to drop oil on the troubled waters
'my lord' i told him 'you have but to posses your soul with patience for a few short weeks just until the ship the governor sends can return
then all must needs be as your lordship wishes
in the meantime you may find existence in these wilds and away from that good company which is the soul of life endurable and perhaps pleasant
you may have daily sight of the lady who is to become your wife and that should count for much with so ardent and determined a lover as your lordship hath shown yourself to be
you may have the pleasure of contemplating your rival's grave if you kill him
if he kills you you will care the less about the date of the santa teresa's sailing
the land too hath inducements to offer to a philosophical and contemplative mind such as one whom his majesty delighteth to honor must needs possess
beside these crystal rivers and among these odoriferous woods my lord one escapes much expense envy contempt vanity and vexation of mind
'  the hoary sinner laughed and laughed
when he had gone away still in huge enjoyment of his own mirth i who had seen small cause for mirth went slowly indoors
not a yard from the door in the shadow of the vines that draped the window stood the woman who was bringing this fate upon me
i thought that you were in your own room i said harshly after a moment of dead silence
i came to the window she replied
i listened
i heard all she spoke haltingly through dry lips
her face was as white as her ruff but a strange light burned in her eyes and there was no trembling
this morning you said that all that you hadyour name and your swordwere at my service
you may take them both again sir
i refuse the aid you offer
swear what you will tell them what you please make your peace whilst you may
i will not have your blood upon my soul  there was yet wine upon the table
i filled a cup and brought it to her
drink i commanded
i have much of forbearance much of courtesy to thank you for she said
i will remember it whendo not think that i shall blame you  i held the cup to her lips
drink i repeated
she touched the red wine with her lips
i took it from her and put it to my own
we drink of the same cup i said with my eyes upon hers and drained it to the bottom
i am weary of swords and courts and kings
let us go into the garden and watch the minister's bees    chapter x in which master pory gains time to some purpose   rolfe coming down by boat from varina had reached the town in the dusk of that day which had seen the arrival of the santa teresa and i had gone to him before i slept that night
early morning found us together again in the field behind the church
we had not long to wait in the chill air and dewdrenched grass
when the red rim of the sun showed like a fire between the trunks of the pines came my lord carnal and with him master pory and dr lawrence bohun
my lord and i bowed to each other profoundly
rolfe with my sword and master pory with my lord's stepped aside to measure the blades
dr bohun muttering something about the feverishness of the early air wrapped his cloak about him and huddled in among the roots of a gigantic cedar
i stood with my back to the church and my face to the red water between us and the illimitable forest my lord opposite me six feet away
he was dressed again splendidly in black and scarlet colors he much affected and with the dark beauty of his face and the arrogant grace with which he stood there waiting for his sword made a picture worth looking upon
rolfe and the secretary came back to us
if you kill him ralph said the former in a low voice as he took my doublet from me you are to put yourself in my hands and do as you are bid  which means that you will try to smuggle me north to the dutch
thanks friend but i'll see the play out here  you were ever obstinate selfwilled recklessand the man most to my heart he continued
have your way in god's name but i wish not to see what will come of it
all's ready master secretary  very slowly that worthy stooped down and examined the ground narrowly and quite at his leisure
i like it not master rolfe he declared at length
here is a molehill and there a fairy ring  i see neither said rolfe
it looks as smooth as a table
but we can easily shift under the cedars where there is no grass  here's a projecting root announced the secretary when the new ground had been reached
rolfe shrugged his shoulders but we moved again
the light comes jaggedly through the branches objected my lord's second
better try the open again  rolfe uttered an exclamation of impatience and my lord stamped his foot on the ground
what is this foolery sir the latter cried fiercely
the ground's well enough and there 's sufficient light to die by  let the light pass then said his second resignedly
gentlemen are you readods blood
my lord i had not noticed the roses upon your lordship's shoes
they are so large and have such a fall that they sweep the ground on either side your foot you might stumble in all that dangling ribbon and lace
allow me to remove them  he unsheathed his knife and sinking upon his knees began leisurely to sever the threads that held the roses to the leather
as he worked he looked neither at the roses nor at my lord's angry face but beneath his own bent arm toward the church and the town beyond
how long he would have sawed away at the threads there is no telling for my lord amongst whose virtues patience was not one broke from him and with an oath stooped and tore away the offending roses with his own hand then straightened himself and gripped his sword more closely
i've learned one thing in this dd land he snarled and that is where not to choose a second
you sir to rolfe give the word  master pory rose from his knees unruffled and unabashed and still with a curiously absent expression upon his fat face and with his ears cocked in the direction of the church
one moment gentlemen he said
i have just bethought me  on guard cried rolfe and cut him short
the king's favorite was no mean antagonist
once or twice the thought crossed my mind that here where i least desired it i had met my match
the apprehension passed
he fought as he lived with a fierce intensity a headlong passion a brute force bearing down and overwhelming most obstacles
but that i could tire him out i soon knew
the incessant flash and clash of steel the quick changes in position the need to bring all powers of body and mind to aid of eye and wrist the will to win the shame of loss the rage and lust of bloodthere was no sight or sound outside that trampled circle that could force itself upon our brain or make us glance aside
if there was a sudden commotion amongst the three witnesses if an expression of immense relief and childlike satisfaction reigned in master pory's face we knew it not
we were both bleedingi from a pin prick on the shoulder he from a touch beneath the arm
he made a desperate thrust which i parried and the blades clashed
a third came down upon them with such force that the sparks flew
in the king's name commanded the governor
we fell apart panting white with rage staring at the unexpected disturbers of our peace
they were the governor the commander the cape merchant and the watch
lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace exclaimed master pory and retired to the cedar and dr bohun
this ends here gentlemen said the governor firmly
you are both bleeding
it is enough  out of my way sir cried my lord foaming at the mouth
he made a mad thrust over the governor's extended arm at me who was ready enough to meet him
have at thee thou bridegroom he said between his teeth
the governor caught him by the wrist
put up your sword my lord or as i stand here you shall give it into the commander's hands  hell and furies ejaculated my lord
do you know who i am sir  ay replied the governor sturdily i do know
it is because of that knowledge my lord carnal that i interfere in this affair
were you other than you are you and this gentleman might fight until doomsday and meet with no hindrance from me
being what you are i will prevent any renewal of this duel by fair means if i may by foul if i must  he left my lord and came over to me
since when have you been upon my lord warwick's side ralph percy he demanded lowering his voice
i am not so i said
then appearances are mightily deceitful he retorted
i know what you mean sir george i answered
i know that if the king's darling should meet death or maiming in this fashion upon virginian soil the company already so out of favor might find some difficulty in explaining things to his majesty's satisfaction
but i think my lord southampton and sir edwyn sandys and sir george yeardley equal to the task especially if they are able to deliver to his majesty the man whom his majesty will doubtless consider the true and only rebel and murderer
let us fight it out sir
you can all retire to a distance and remain in profound ignorance of any such affair
if i fall you have nothing to fear
if he fallswhy i shall not run away and the due return sails tomorrow  he eyed me closely from under frowning brows
and when your wife's a widow what then he asked abruptly
i have not known many better men than this simple straightforward soldierly governor
the manliness of his character begot trust invited confidence
men told him of their hidden troubles almost against their will and afterward felt neither shame nor fear knowing the simplicity of his thoughts and the reticence of his speech
i looked him in the eyes and let him read what i would have shown to no other and felt no shame
the lord may raise her up a helper i said
at least she won't have to marry him  he turned on his heel and moved back to his former station between us two
my lord carnal he said and you captain percy heed what i say for what i say i will do
you may take your choice either you will sheathe your swords here in my presence giving me your word of honor that you will not draw them upon each other before his majesty shall have made known his will in this matter to the company and the company shall have transmitted it to me in token of which truce between you you shall touch each other's hands or you will pass the time between this and the return of the ship with the king's and the company's will in strict confinementyou captain percy in gaol and you my lord carnal in my own poor house where i will use my best endeavors to make the days pass as pleasantly as possible for your lordship
i have spoken gentlemen  there was no protest
for my own part i knew yeardley too well to attempt any moreover had i been in his place his course should have been mine
for my lord carnalwhat black thoughts visited that fierce and sullen brain i know not but there was acquiescence in his face haughty dark and vengeful though it was
slowly and as with one motion we sheathed our swords and more slowly still repeated the few words after the governor
his honor's countenance shone with relief
take each other by the hand gentlemen and then let 's all to breakfast at my own house where there shall be no feud save with good capon pasty and jolly good ale in dead silence my lord and i touched each other's finger tips
the world was now a flood of sunshine the mist on the river vanishing the birds singing the trees waving in the pleasant morning air
from the town came the roll of the drum summoning all to the weekday service
the bells too began to ring sounding sweetly through the clear air
the governor took off his hat
let's all to church gentlemen he said gravely
our cheeks are flushed as with a fever and our pulses run high this morning
there be some among us perhaps that have in their hearts discontent anger and hatred
i know no better place to take such passions provided we bring them not forth again  we went in and sat down
jeremy sparrow was in the pulpit
singly or in groups the town folk entered
down the aisle strode bearded men old soldiers adventurers sailors scarred body and soul young men followed younger sons and younger brothers prodigals whose portion had been spent whose souls now ate of the husks to the servants' benches came dull laborers dimly comprehending groping in the twilight women entered softly and slowly some with children clinging to their skirts
one came alone and knelt alone her face shadowed by her mantle
amongst the servants stood a slave or two blindly staring and behind them all one of that felon crew sent us by the king
through the open windows streamed the summer sunshine soft and fragrant impartial and unquestioning caressing alike the uplifted face of the minister the head of the convict and all between
the minister's voice was grave and tender when he read and prayed but in the hymn it rose above the people's like the voice of some mighty archangel
that triumphant singing shook the air and still rang in the heart while we said the creed
when the service was over the congregation waited for the governor to pass out first
at the door he pressed me to go with him and his party to his own house and i gave him thanks but made excuse to stay away
when he and the nobleman who was his guest had left the churchyard and the townspeople too were gone i and my wife and the minister walked home together through the dewy meadow with the splendor of the morning about us and the birds caroling from every tree and thicket
chapter xi in which i meet an italian doctor   the summer slipped away and autumn came with the purple of the grape and the yellowing corn the nuts within the forest and the return of the countless wild fowl to the marshes and reedy river banks and still i stayed in jamestown and my wife with me and still the santa teresa rode at anchor in the river below the fort
if the man whom she brought knew that by tarrying in virginia he risked his ruin with the king yet with a courage worthy of a better cause he tarried
now and then ships came in but they were small belated craft
the most had left england before the sailing of the santa teresa the rest private ventures trading for clapboard or sassafras knew nothing of court affairs
only the sea flower sailing from london a fortnight after the santa teresa and much delayed by adverse winds brought a letter from the deputy treasurer to yeardley and the council
from rolfe i learned its contents
it spoke of the stir that was made by the departure from the realm of the king's favorite
none know where he hath gone
the king looks dour 't is hinted that the privy council are as much at sea as the rest of the world my lord of buckingham saith nothing but his followingwhich of late hath somewhat decayedis so increased that his antechambers cannot hold the throngs that come to wait upon him
some will have it that my lord carnal hath fled the kingdom to escape the tower others that the king hath sent him on a mission to the king of spain about this detested spanish match others that the gadfly hath stung him and he is gone to americato search for raleigh's gold mine maybe
this last most improbable but if 't is so and he should touch at virginia receive him with all honor
if indeed he is not out of favor the company may find in him a powerful friend of powerful enemies god knows there is no lack  thus the worthy master ferrar
and at the bottom of the letter among other news of city and court mention was made of the disappearance of a ward of the king's the lady jocelyn leigh
strict search had been made but the unfortunate lady had not been found
't is whispered that she hath killed herself also that his majesty had meant to give her in marriage to my lord carnal
but that all true love and virtue and constancy have gone from the age one might conceive that the said lord had but fled the court for a while to indulge his grief in some solitude of hill and stream and shady valethe lost lady being right worthy of such dole  in sooth she was but my lord was not given to such fashion of mourning
the summer passed and i did nothing
what was there i could do
i had written by the due return to sir edwyn and to my cousin the earl of northumberland
the king hated sir edwyn as he hated tobacco and witchcraft
choose the devil but not sir edwyn sandys had been his passionate words to the company the year before
a certain fifth of november had despoiled my lord of northumberland of wealth fame and influence
small hope there was in those two
that the governor and council remembering old dangers shared wished me well i did not doubt but that was all
yeardley had done all he could do more than most men would have dared to do in procuring this delay
there was no further help in him nor would i have asked it
already out of favor with the warwick faction he had risked enough for me and mine
i could not flee with my wife to the indians exposing her perhaps to a death by fierce tortures moreover opechancanough had of late strangely taken to returning to the settlements those runaway servants and fugitives from justice which before we had demanded from him in vain
if even it had been possible to run the gauntlet of the indian villages war parties and hunting bands what would have been before us but endless forest and a winter which for us would have had no spring
i could not see her die of hunger and cold or by the teeth of the wolves
i could not do what i should have liked to dotake singlehanded that king's ship with its sturdy crew and sail with her south and ever southwards before us nothing more formidable than spanish ships and beyond them blue waters spice winds new lands strange islands of the blest
there seemed naught that i could do naught that she could do
our fate had us by the hands and held us fast
we stood still and the days came and went like dreams
while the assembly was in session i had my part to act as burgess from my hundred
each day i sat with my fellows in the church facing the governor in his great velvet chair the council on either hand and listened to the droning of old twine the clerk like the droning of the bees without the window to the chant of the sergeantatarms to long and windy discourses from men who planted better than they spoke to remarks by the secretary witty crammed with latin and traveled talk to the governor's slow weighty words
at weyanoke we had had trouble with the indians
i was one who loved them not and had fought them well for which reason the hundred chose me its representative
in the assembly it was my part to urge a greater severity toward those our natural enemies a greater watchfulness on our part the need for palisades and sentinels the danger that lay in their acquisition of firearms which in defiance of the law men gave them in exchange for worthless indian commodities
this indian business was the chief matter before the assembly
i spoke when i thought speech was needed and spoke strongly for my heart foreboded that which was to come upon us too soon and too surely
the governor listened gravely nodding his head master pory too the cape merchant and west were of my mind but the remainder were besotted by their own conceit esteeming the very name of englishman sentinel and palisade enough or trusting in the smooth words and vows of brotherhood poured forth so plentifully by that red apollyon opechancanough
when the day's work was done and we streamed out of the churchthe governor and council first the rest of us in orderit was to find as often as not a red and black figure waiting for us among the graves
sometimes it joined itself to the governor sometimes to master pory sometimes the whole party save one went off with it to the guest house there to eat drink and make merry
if virginia and all that it contained save only that jewel of which it had robbed the court were out of favor with the king's minion he showed it not
perhaps he had accepted the inevitable with a good grace perhaps it was but his mode of biding his time but he had shifted into that soldierly frankness of speech and manner that genial hailfellowwellmet air behind which most safely hides a villain's mind
two days after that morning behind the church he had removed himself his french valets and his italian physician from the governor's house to the newly finished guest house
here he lived cock of the walk taking his ease in his inn elbowing out all guests save those of his own inviting
if what with his open face and his open hand his dinners and bearbaitings and hunting parties his tales of the court and the wars his half hints as to the good he might do virginia with the king extending even to the lightening of the tax upon our tobacco and the prohibition of the spanish import his known riches and power and the unknown height to which they might attain if his star at court were indeed in the ascendantif with these things he slowly but surely won to his following all save a very few of those i had thought my fast friends it was not a thing marvelous or without precedent
upon his side was good that might be seen and handled on mine was only a dubious right and a not at all dubious danger
i do not think it plagued me much
the going of those who had it in their heart to wish to go left me content and for those who fawned upon him from the first or for the rabble multitude who flung up their caps and ran at his heels i cared not a doit
there were still rolfe and west and the governor jeremy sparrow and diccon
my lord and i met perforce in the street at the governor's house in church on the river in the saddle
if we met in the presence of others we spoke the necessary formal words of greeting or leavetaking and he kept his countenance if none were by off went the mask
the man himself and i looked each other in the eyes and passed on
once we encountered on a late evening among the graves and i was not alone
mistress percy had been restless and had gone despite the minister's protests to sit upon the river bank
when i returned from the assembly and found her gone i went to fetch her
a storm was rolling slowly up
returning the long way through the churchyard we came upon him sitting beside a sunken grave his knees drawn up to meet his chin his eyes gloomily regardful of the dark broad river the unseen ocean and the ship that could not return for weeks to come
we passed him in silencei with a slight bow she with a slighter curtsy
an hour later going down the street in the dusk of the storm i ran against dr lawrence bohun
don't stop me he panted
the italian doctor is away in the woods gathering simples and they found my lord carnal in a fit among the graves half an hour agone my lord was bled and the next morning went hunting
the lady whom i had married abode with me in the minister's house held her head high and looked the world in the face
she seldom went from home but when she did take the air it was with pomp and circumstance
when that slender figure and exquisite face set off by as rich apparel as could be bought from a store of finery brought in by the southampton and attended by a turbaned negress and a serving man who had been to the wars and had escaped the wheel by the skin of his teeth appeared in the street small wonder if a greater commotion arose than had been since the days of the princess pocahontas and her train of dusky beauties
to this fairer more imperial dame gold lace doffed its hat and made its courtliest bow and young planters bent to their saddlebows while the common folk nudged and stared and had their say
the beauty the grace the pride that deigned small response to wellmeant wordsall that would have been intolerable in plain mistress percy once a waiting maid then a piece of merchandise to be sold for one hundred and twenty pounds of tobacco then the wife of a poor gentleman was pardoned readily enough to the lady jocelyn leigh the ward of the king the bride to be so soon as the king's court of high commission should have snapped in twain an inconvenient and illwelded fetter of the king's minion
so she passed like a splendid vision through the street perhaps once a week
on sundays she went with me to church and the people looked at her instead of at the minister who rebuked them not because his eyes were upon the same errand
the early autumn passed and the leaves began to turn and still all things were as they had been save that the assembly sat no longer
my fellow burgesses went back to their hundreds but my house at weyanoke knew me no more
in a tone that was apologetic but firm the governor had told me that he wished my company at jamestown
i was pleased enough to stay i assured himas indeed i was
at weyanoke the thunderbolt would fall without warning at jamestown at least i could see coming up the river the sails of the due return or what other ship the company might send
the color of the leaves deepened and there came a season of a beauty singular and sad like a smile left upon the face of the dead summer
over all things near and far the forest where it met the sky the nearer woods the great river and the streams that empty into it there hung a blue haze soft and dreamlike
the forest became a painted forest with an ever thinning canopy and an ever thickening carpet of crimson and gold everywhere there was a low rustling underfoot and a slow rain of color
it was neither cold nor hot but very quiet and the birds went by like shadowsa listless and forgetful weather in which we began to look every hour of every day for the sail which we knew we should not see for weeks to come
good master bucke tarried with master thorpe at henricus recruiting his strength and jeremy sparrow preached in his pulpit slept in his chamber and worked in his garden
this garden ran down to the green bank of the river and here sitting idly by the stream her chin in her hand and her dark eyes watching the strong free sea birds as they came and went i found my wife one evening as i came from the fort where had been some martial exercise
thirty feet away master jeremy sparrow worked among the dying flowers and hummed      there is a garden in her face       where roses and white lilies grow  he and i had agreed that when i must needs be absent he should be within call of her for i believed my lord carnal very capable of intruding himself into her presence
that house and garden her movements and mine were spied upon by his foreign hirelings i knew perfectly well
as i sat down upon the bank at her feet she turned to me with a sudden passion
i am weary of it all she cried
i am tired of being pent up in this house and garden and of the watch you keep upon me
and if i go abroad it is worse
i hate all those shameless faces that stare at me as if i were in the pillory
i am pilloried before you all and i find the experience sufficiently bitter
and when i think that that man whom i hate hate hate breathes the air that i breathe it stifles me
if i could fly away like those birds if i could only be gone from this place for even a day  i would beg leave to take you home to weyanoke i said after a pause but i cannot go and leave the field to him  and i cannot go she answered
i must watch for that ship and that king's command that my lord carnal thinks potent enough to make me his wife
king's commands are strong but a woman's will is stronger
at the last i shall know what to do
but now why may i not take angela and cross that strip of sand and go into the woods on the other side
they are so fair and strangeall red and yellowand they look very still and peaceful
i could walk in them or lie down under the trees and forget awhile and they are not at all far away she looked at me eagerly
you could not go alone i told her
there would be danger in that
but tomorrow if you choose i and master sparrow and diccon will take you there
a day in the woods is pleasant enough and will do none of us harm
then you may wander as you please fill your arms with colored leaves and forget the world
we will watch that no harm comes nigh you but otherwise you shall not be disturbed  she broke into delighted laughter
of all women the most steadfast of soul her outward moods were as variable as a child's
agreed she cried
you and the minister and diccon demon shall lay your muskets across your knees and angela shall witch you into stone with her old mad heathen charms
and thenand theni will gather more gold than had king midas i will dance with the hamadryads i will find out oberon and make titania jealous  i do not doubt that you could do so i said as she sprang to her feet childishly eager and radiantly beautiful
i rose to go in with her for it was supper time but in a moment changed my mind and resumed my seat on the bank of turf
do you go in i said
there's a snake near by in those bushes below the bank
i'll kill the creature and then i'll come to supper  when she was gone i walked to where ten feet away the bank dipped to a clump of reeds and willows planted in the mud on the brink of the river
dropping on my knees i leaned over and grasping a man by the collar lifted him from the slime where he belonged to the bank beside me
it was my lord carnal's italian doctor that i had so fished up
i had seen him before and had found in his very small mean figure clad all in black and his narrow face with malignant eyes and thin white lips drawn tightly over gleaming teeth something infinitely repulsive sickening to the sight as are certain reptiles to the touch
there are no simples or herbs of grace to be found amongst reeds and halfdrowned willows i said
what did so learned a doctor look for in so unlikely a place  he shrugged his shoulders and made play with his clawlike hands as if he understood me not
it was a lie for i knew that he and the english tongue were sufficiently acquainted
i told him as much and he shot at me a most venomous glance but continued to shrug gesticulate and jabber in italian
at last i saw nothing better to do than to take him still by the collar to the edge of the garden next the churchyard and with the toe of my boot to send him tumbling among the graves
i watched him pick himself up set his attire to rights and go away in the gathering dusk winding in and out among the graves and then i went in to supper and told mistress percy that the snake was dead
chapter xii in which i receive a warning and repose a trust   shortly before daybreak i was wakened by a voice beneath my window
captain percy it cried the governor wishes you at his house and was gone
i dressed and left the house disturbing no one
hurrying through the chill dawn i reached the square not much behind the rapid footsteps of the watch who had wakened me
about the governor's door were horses saddled and bridled with grooms at their heads men and beasts gray and indistinct wrapped in the fog
i went up the steps and into the hall and knocked at the door of the governor's great room
it opened and i entered to find sir george with master pory rolfe west and others of the council gathered about the great centre table and talking eagerly
the governor was but half dressed west and rolfe were in jack boots and coats of mail
a man breathless with hard riding spattered with swamp mud and torn by briers stood cap in hand staring from one to the other
in good time captain percy cried the governor
yesterday you called the profound peace with the indians of which some of us boasted the lull before the storm
faith it looks today as though you were in the right after all  what 's the matter sir i asked advancing to the table
matter enough he answered
this man has come post haste from the plantations above paspahegh
three days ago morgan the trader was decoyed into the woods by that paspahegh fool and bully nemattanow whom they call jack of the feather and there murdered
yesterday out of sheer bravado the indian turned up at morgan's house and morgan's men shot him down
they buried the dog and thought no more of it
three hours ago chanco the christian went to the commander and warned him that the paspaheghs were in a ferment and that the warriors were painting themselves black
the commander sent off at once to me and i see naught better to do than to dispatch you with a dozen men to bring them to their senses
but there 's to be no harrying nor battle
a show of force is all that 's neededi'll stake my head upon it
let them see that we are not to be taken unawares but give them fair words
that they may be the sooner placated i send with you master rolfethey'll listen to him
see that the black paint is covered with red give them some beads and a knife or two then come home
if you like not the look of things find out where opechancanough is and i'll send him an embassy
he loves us well and will put down any disaffection  there's no doubt that he loves us i said dryly
he loves us as a cat loves the mouse that it plays with
if we are to start at once sir i'll go get my horse  then meet us at the neck of land said rolfe
i nodded and left the room
as i descended the steps into the growing light outside i found master pory at my side
i kept late hours last night he remarked with a portentous yawn
now that this business is settled i'll go back to bed  i walked on in silence
i am in your black books he continued with his sly merry sidelong glance
you think that i was overcareful of the ground that morning behind the church and so unfortunately delayed matters until the governor happened by and brought things to another guess conclusion  i think that you warned the governor i said bluntly
he shook with laughter
warned him
of course i warned him
youth would never have seen that molehill and fairy ring and projecting root but wisdom cometh with gray hairs my son
d' ye not think i'll have the king's thanks  doubtless i answered
an the price contents you i do not know why i should quarrel with it  by this we were halfway down the street and we now came upon the guest house
a window above us was unshuttered and in the room within a light still burned
suddenly it was extinguished
a man's face looked down upon us for a moment then drew back a skeleton hand was put out softly and slowly and the shutter drawn to
hand and face belonged to the man i had sent tumbling among the graves the evening before
the italian doctor said master pory
there was something peculiar in his tone
i glanced at him but his broad red face and twinkling eyes told me nothing
the italian doctor  he repeated
if i had a friend in captain percy's predicament i should bid him beware of the italian doctor  your friend would be obliged for the warning i replied
we walked a little further
and i think he said that i should inform this purely hypothetical friend of mine that the italian and his patron had their heads mighty close together last night  last night  ay last night
i went to drink with my lord and so broke up their teteatete
my lord was boisterous in his cups and not oversecret
he dropped some hintshe broke off to indulge in one of his endless silent laughs
i don't know why i tell you this captain percy
i am on the other side you knowquite on the other side
but now i bethink me i am only telling you what i should tell you were i upon your side
there's no harm in that i hope no disloyalty to my lord carnal's interests which happen to be my interests  i made no answer
i gave him credit both for his ignorance of the very hornbook of honor and for his large share of the milk of human kindness
my lord grows restive he said when we had gone a little further
the francis and john coming in yesterday brought court news
out of sight out of mind
buckingham is making hay while the sun shines
useth angel water for his complexion sleepeth in a medicated mask such as the valois used and is grown handsomer than ever changeth the fashion of his clothes thrice a week which mightily pleaseth his majesty
whoops on the spanish match too and wonderful past all whooping from the prince's detestation hath become his bosom friend
small wonder if my lord carnal thinks it's time he was back at whitehall  let him go then i said
there's his ship that brought him here  ay there 's his ship rejoined master pory
a few weeks more and the due return will be here with the company's commands
d' ye think captain percy that there's the slightest doubt as to their tenor  no  then my lord has but to possess his soul with patience and wait for the due return
no doubt he'll do so  no doubt he'll do so i echoed
by this we had reached the secretary's own door
fortune favor you with the paspaheghs he said with another mighty yawn
as for me i'll to bed
do you ever dream captain percy
i don't mine is too good a conscience
but if i did i should dream of an italian doctor  the door shut upon his red face and bright eyes
i walked rapidly on down the street to the minister's house
the light was very pale as yet and house and garden lay beneath a veil of mist
no one was stirring
i went on through the gray wet paths to the stable and roused diccon
saddle black lamoral quickly i ordered
there's trouble with the paspaheghs and i am off with master rolfe to settle it  am i to go with you he asked
i shook my head
we have a dozen men
there's no need of more  i left him busy with the horse and went to the house
in the hall i found the negress strewing the floor with fresh rushes and asked her if her mistress yet slept
in her soft half english half spanish she answered in the affirmative
i went to my own room and armed myself then ran upstairs to the comfortable chamber where abode master jeremy sparrow surrounded by luxuries which his soul contemned
he was not there
at the foot of the stair i was met by goodwife allen
the minister was called an hour ago sir she announced
there's a man dying of the fever at archer's hope and they sent a boat for him
he won't be back until afternoon  i hurried past her back to the stable
black lamoral was saddled and diccon held the stirrup for me to mount
good luck with the vermin sir he said
i wish i were going too  his tone was sullen yet wistful
i knew that he loved danger as i loved it and a sudden remembrance of the dangers we had faced together brought us nearer to each other than we had been for many a day
i don't take you i explained because i have need of you here
master sparrow has gone to watch beside a dying man and will not be back for hours
as for myself there's no telling how long i may be kept
until i come you are to guard house and garden well
you know what i mean
your mistress is to be molested by no one  very well sir  one thing more
there was some talk yesterday of my taking her across the neck to the forest
when she awakes tell her from me that i am sorry for her to lose her pleasure but that now she could not go even were i here to take her  there 's no danger from the paspaheghs there he muttered
the paspaheghs happen not to be my only foes i said curtly
do as i bid you without remark
tell her that i have good reasons for desiring her to remain within doors until my return
on no account whatever is she to venture without the garden  i gathered up the reins and he stood back from the horse's head
when i had gone a few paces i drew rein and turning in my saddle spoke to him across the dewdrenched grass
this is a trust diccon i said
the red came into his tanned face
he raised his hand and made our old military salute
i understand it so my captain he answered and i rode away satisfied
chapter xiii in which the santa teresa drops downstream   an hour's ride brought us to the block house standing within the forest midway between the white plantations at paspahegh and the village of the tribe
we found it well garrisoned spies out and the men inclined to make light of the black paint and the seething village
amongst them was chanco the christian
i called him to me and we listened to his report with growing perturbation
thirty warriors  i said when he had finished
and they are painted yellow as well as black and have dashed their cheeks with puccoon it's l'outrance then
and the war dance is toward
if we are to pacify this hornets' nest it's high time we set about it
gentlemen of the block house we are but twelve and they may beat us back in which case those that are left of us will fight it out with you here
watch for us therefore and have a sally party ready
forward men  one moment captain percy said rolfe
chanco where's the emperor  five suns ago he was with the priests at uttamussac answered the indian
yesterday at the full sun power he was in the lodge of the werowance of the chickahominies
he feasts there still
the chickahominies and the powhatans have buried the hatchet  i regret to hear it i remarked
whilst they took each other's scalps mine own felt the safer  i advise going direct to opechancanough said rolfe
since he's only a league away so do i i answered
we left the block house and the clearing around it and plunged into the depths of the forest
in these virgin woods the trees are set well apart though linked one to the other by the omnipresent grape and there is little undergrowth so that we were able to make good speed
rolfe and i rode well in front of our men
by now the sun was shining through the lower branches of the trees and the mist was fast vanishing
the forestaround us above us and under the hoofs of the horses where the fallen leaves lay thickwas as yellow as gold and as red as blood
rolfe i asked breaking a long silence do you credit what the indians say of opechancanough  that he was brother to powhatan only by adoption  that fleeing for his life he came to virginia years and years ago from some mysterious land far to the south and west  i do not know he replied thoughtfully
he is like and yet not like the people whom he rules
in his eye there is the authority of mind his features are of a nobler cast   and his heart is of a darker i said
it is a strange and subtle savage  strange enough and subtle enough i admit he answered though i believe not with you that his friendliness toward us is but a mask  believe it or not it is so i said
that dark cold still face is a mask and that simpleseeming amazement at horses and armor guns and blue beads is a mask
it is in my mind that some fair day the mask will be dropped
here's the village  until our interview with chanco the christian the village of the paspaheghs and not the village of the chickahominies had been our destination and since leaving the block house we had made good speed but now within the usual girdle of mulberries we were met by the werowance and his chief men with the customary savage ceremonies
we had long since come to the conclusion that the birds of the air and the fish of the streams were mercuries to the indians
the werowance received us in due form with presents of fish and venison cakes of chinquapin meal and gourds of pohickory an uncouth dance by twelve of his young men and a deal of hellish noise then at our command led us into the village and to the lodge which marked its centre
around it were gathered opechancanough's own warriors men from orapax and uttamussac and werowocomoco chosen for their strength and cunning while upon the grass beneath a bloodred gum tree sat his wives painted and tattooed with great strings of pearl and copper about their necks
beyond them were the women and children of the chickahominies and around us all the red forest
the mat that hung before the door of the lodge was lifted and an indian emerging came forward with a gesture of welcome
it was nantauquas the lady rebekah's brother and the one indiansaving always his dead sisterthat was ever to my liking a savage indeed but a savage as brave and chivalrous as courteous and truthful as a christian knight
rolfe sprang from his horse and advancing to meet the young chief embraced him
nantauquas had been much with his sister during those her happy days at varina before she went with rolfe that illfated voyage to england and rolfe loved him for her sake and for his own
i thought you at orapax nantauquas he exclaimed
i was there my brother said the indian and his voice was sweet deep and grave like that of his sister
but opechancanough would go to uttamussac to the temple and the dead kings
i lead his war parties now and i came with him
opechancanough is within the lodge
he asks that my brother and captain percy come to him there  he lifted the mat for us and followed us into the lodge
there was the usual winding entrance with half a dozen mats to be lifted one after the other but at last we came to the central chamber and to the man we sought
he sat beside a small fire burning redly in the twilight of the room
the light shone now upon the feathers in his scalp lock now upon the triple row of pearls around his neck now upon knife and tomahawk in his silk grass belt now on the otterskin mantle hanging from his shoulder and drawn across his knees
how old he was no man knew
men said that he was older than powhatan and powhatan was very old when he died
but he looked a man in the prime of life his frame was vigorous his skin unwrinkled his eyes bright and full
when he rose to welcome us and nantauquas stood beside him there seemed not a score of years between them
the matter upon which we had come was not one that brooked delay
we waited with what patience we might until his long speech of welcome was finished when in as few words as possible rolfe laid before him our complaint against the paspaheghs
the indian listened then said in that voice that always made me think of some cold still bottomless pool lying black beneath overhanging rocks my brothers may go in peace
the paspaheghs have washed off the black paint
if my brothers go to the village they will find the peace pipe ready for their smoking  rolfe and i stared at each other
i have sent messengers continued the emperor
i have told the paspaheghs of my love for the white man and of the goodwill the white man bears the indian
i have told them that nemattanow was a murderer and that his death was just
they are satisfied
their village is as still as this beast at my feet he pointed downward to a tame panther crouched against his moccasins
i thought it an ominous comparison
involuntarily we looked at nantauquas
it is true he said
i am but come from the village of the paspaheghs
i took them the word of opechancanough  then since the matter is settled we may go home i remarked rising as i spoke
we could of course have put down the paspaheghs with one hand giving them besides a lesson which they would not soon forget but in the kindness of our hearts toward them and to save ourselves trouble we came to opechancanough
for his aid in this trifling business the governor gives him thanks  a smile just lit the features of the indian
it was gone in a moment
does not opechancanough love the white men he said
some day he will do more than this for them  we left the lodge and the dark emperor within it got to horse and quitted the village with its painted people yellowing mulberries and bloodred gum trees
nantauquas went with us keeping pace with rolfe's horse and giving us now and then in his deep musical voice this or that bit of woodland news
at the block house we found confirmation of the emperor's statement
an embassy from the paspaheghs had come with presents and the peace pipe had been smoked
the spies too brought news that all warlike preparations had ceased in the village
it had sunk once more into a quietude befitting the sleepy dreamy hazy weather
rolfe and i held a short consultation
all appeared safe but there was the possibility of a ruse
at the last it seemed best that he who by virtue of his peculiar relations with the indians was ever our negotiator should remain with half our troop at the block house while i reported to the governor
so i left him and nantauquas with him and rode back to jamestown reaching the town some hours sooner than i was expected
it was after nooning when i passed through the gates of the palisade and an hour later when i finished my report to the governor
when he at last dismissed me i rode quickly down the street toward the minister's house
as i passed the guest house i glanced up at the window from which at daybreak the italian had looked down upon me
no one looked out now the window was closely shuttered and at the door beneath my lord's french rascals were conspicuously absent
a few yards further on i met my lord face to face as he emerged from a lane that led down to the river
at sight of me he started violently and his hand went to his mouth
i slightly bent my head and rode on past him
at the gate of the churchyard a stone's throw from home i met master jeremy sparrow
well met he exclaimed
are the indians quiet  for the nonce
how is your sick man  very well he answered gravely
i closed his eyes two hours ago  he's dead then i said
well he 's out of his troubles and hath that advantage over the living
have you another call that you travel from home so fast  why to tell the truth he replied i could not but feel uneasy when i learned just now of this commotion amongst the heathen
you must know best but i should not have thought it a day for madam to walk in the woods so i e'en thought i would cross the neck and bring her home  for madam to walk in the woods i said slowly
so she walks there
with whom  with diccon and angela he answered
they went before the sun was an hour high so goodwife allen says
i thought that you no i told him
on the contrary i left command that she should not venture outside the garden
there are more than indians abroad  i was white with anger but besides anger there was fear in my heart
i will go at once and bring her home i said
as i spoke i happened to glance toward the fort and the shipping in the river beyond
something seemed wrong with the prospect
i looked again and saw what hated and familiar object was missing
where is the santa teresa i demanded the fear at my heart tugging harder
she dropped downstream this morning
i passed her as i came up from archer's hope awhile ago
she's anchored in midstream off the big spring
why did she go  we looked each other in the eyes and each read the thought that neither cared to put into words
you can take the brown mare i said speaking lightly because my heart was as heavy as lead and we'll ride to the forest
it is all right i dare say
doubtless we'll find her garlanding herself with the grape or playing with the squirrels or asleep on the red leaves with her head in angela's lap  doubtless he said
don't lose time
i'll saddle the mare and overtake you in two minutes    chapter xiv in which we seek a lost lady   beside the minister and myself nothing human moved in the crimson woods
blue haze was there and the steady drift of colored leaves and the sunshine freely falling through bared limbs but no man or woman
the fallen leaves rustled as the deer passed the squirrels chattered and the foxes barked but we heard no sweet laughter or ringing song
we found a bank of moss and lying upon it a chaplet of redbrown oak leaves further on the mint beside a crystal streamlet had been trodden underfoot then flung down upon the brown earth beneath some pines we came upon a long trailer of scarlet vine
beyond was a fairy hollow a cuplike depression curtained from the world by the red vines that hung from the trees upon its brim and carpeted with the gold of a great maple and here fear became a giant with whom it was vain to wrestle
there had been a struggle in the hollow
the curtain of vines was torn the boughs of a sumach bent and broken the fallen leaves groun underfoot
in one place there was blood upon the leaves
the forest seemed suddenly very quietquite soundless save for the beating of our hearts
on every side opened red and yellow ways sunny glades labyrinthine paths long aisles all dim with the blue haze like the cloudy incense in stone cathedrals but nothing moved in them save the creatures of the forest
without the hollow there was no sign
the leaves looked undisturbed or others drifting down had hidden any marks there might have been no footprints no broken branches no token of those who had left the hollow
down which of the painted ways had they gone and where were they now
sparrow and i sat our horses and stared now down this alley now down that into the blue that closed each vista
the santa teresa is just off the big spring he said at last
she must have dropped down there in order to take in water quietly  the man that came upon her is still in townor was an hour agone i replied
then she has n't sailed yet he said
in the distance something grew out of the blue mist
i had not lived thirteen years in the woodland to be dim of sight or dull of hearing
some one is coming i announced
back your horse into this clump of sumach  the sumach grew thick and was draped moreover with some broadleafed vine
within its covert we could see with small danger of being seen unless the approaching figure should prove to be that of an indian
it was not an indian it was my lord carnal
he came on slowly glancing from side to side and pausing now and then as if to listen
he was so little of a woodsman that he never looked underfoot
sparrow touched my arm and pointed down a glade at right angles with the path my lord was pursuing
up this glade there was coming toward us another figurea small black figure that moved swiftly looking neither to the right nor to the left
black lamoral stood like a stone the brown mare too had learned what meant a certain touch upon her shoulder
sparrow and i with small shame for our eavesdropping bent to our saddlebows and looked sideways through tiny gaps in the crimson foliage
my lord descended one side of the hollow his heavy foot bringing down the dead leaves and loose earth the italian glided down the opposite side disturbing the economy of the forest as little as a snake would have done
i thought i should never meet you growled my lord
i thought i had lost you and her and myself
this dd red forest and this blue haze are enough tohe broke off with an oath
i came as fast as i could said the other
his voice was strange thin and dreamy matching his filmy eyes and his eternal very faint smile
your poor physician congratulates your lordship upon the success that still attends you
yours is a fortunate star my lord  then you have her safe cried my lord
three miles from here on the river bank is a ring of pines in which the trees grow so thick that it is always twilight
ten years ago a man was murdered there and sir thomas dale chained the murderer to the tree beneath which his victim was buried and left him to perish of hunger and thirst
that is the tale they tell at jamestown
the wood is said to be haunted by murdered and murderer and no one enters it or comes nearer to it than he can avoid which makes it an excellent resort for those whom the dead cannot scare
the lady is there my lord with your four knaves to guard her
they do not know that the gloom and quiet of the place are due to more than nature  my lord began to laugh
either he had been drinking or the success of his villainy had served for wine
you are a man in a thousand nicolo  he said
how far above or below the ship is this fortunate wood  just opposite my lord  can a boat land easily  a creek runs through the wood to the river
there needs but the appointed signal from the bank and a boat from the santa teresa can be rowed up the stream to the very tree beneath which the lady sits  my lord's laughter rang out again
you're a man in ten thousand nicolo
nicolo the bridegroom's in town  back so soon said the italian
then we must change your lordship's plan
with him on the ground you can no longer wait until nightfall to row downstream to the lady and the santa teresa
he'll come to look for her  ay he'll come to look for her curse him echoed my lord
do you think the dead will scare him continued the italian
no i don't answered my lord with an oath
i would he were among them
an i could have killed him before i went  i had devised a way to do it long ago had not your lordship's conscience been so tender
and yet before now our enemiesyours and mine my lordhave met with sudden and mysterious death
men stared but they ended by calling it a dispensation of providence he broke off to laugh with silent hateful laughter as mirthful as the grin of a death'shead
i know i know said my lord impatiently
we are not overnice nicolo
but between me and those who then stood in my way there had passed no challenge
this is my mortal foe through whose heart i would drive my sword
i would give my ruby to know whether he's in the town or in the forest  he's in the forest i said
black lamoral and the brown mare were beside them before either moved hand or foot or did aught but stare and stare as though men and horses had risen from the dead
all the color was gone from my lord's faceit looked white drawn and pinched as for his companion his countenance did not changenever changed i believebut the trembling of the feather in his hat was not caused by the wind
jeremy sparrow bent down from his saddle seized the italian under the armpits and swung him clean from the ground up to the brown mare's neck
divinity and medicine he said genially soul healer and body poisoner we'll ride double for a time and proceeded to bind the doctor's hands with his own scarf
the creature of venom before him writhed and struggled but the minister's strength was as the strength of ten and the minister's hand held him down
by this i was off black lamoral and facing my lord
the color had come back to his lip and cheek and the flash to his eye
his hand went to his sword hilt
i shall not draw mine my lord i told him
i keep troth  he stared at me with a frown that suddenly changed into a laugh forced and unnatural enough
then go thy ways and let me go mine he cried
be complaisant worthy captain of trainbands and burgess from a dozen huts
the king and i will make it worth your while  i will not draw my sword upon you i replied but i will try a fall with you and i seized him by the wrist
he was a good wrestler as he was a good swordsman but with bitter anger in my heart and a vision of the haunted wood before my eyes i think i could have wrestled with hercules and won
presently i threw him and pinning him down with my knee upon his breast cried to sparrow to cut the bridle reins from black lamoral and throw them to me
though he had the italian upon his hands he managed to obey
with my free hand and my teeth i drew a thong about my lord's arms and bound them to his sides then took my knee from his chest and my hand from his throat and rose to my feet
he rose too with one spring
he was very white and there was foam on his lips
what next captain he demanded thickly
your score is mounting up rather rapidly
what next  this i replied and with the other thong fastened him despite his struggles to the young maple beneath which we had wrestled
when the task was done i first drew his sword from its jeweled scabbard and laid it on the ground at his feet and then cut the leather which restrained his arms leaving him only tied to the tree
i am not sir thomas dale  i said and therefore i shall not gag you and leave you bound for an indefinite length of time to contemplate a grave that you thought to dig
one haunted wood is enough for one county
your lordship will observe that i have knotted your bonds in easy reach of your hands the use of which i have just restored to you
the knot is a peculiar one an indian taught it to me
if you set to work at once you will get it untied before nightfall
that you may not think it the gordian knot and treat it as such i have put your sword where you can get it only when you have worked for it
your familiar my lord may prove of use to us therefore we will take him with us to the haunted wood
i have the honor to wish your lordship a very good day  i bowed low swung myself into my saddle and turned my back upon his glaring eyes and bared teeth
sparrow his prize flung across his saddlebow turned with me
a minute more saw us out of the hollow and entered upon the glade up which had come the italian
when we had gone a short distance i turned in my saddle and looked back
the tiny hollow had vanished all the forest looked level dreamy and still barren of humanity given over to its own shy children nothing moving save the slowfalling leaves
but from beyond a great clump of sumach set like a torch in the vaporous blue came a steady stream of words happily rendered indistinguishable by distance and i knew that the king's minion was cursing the italian the governor the santa teresa the due return the minister the forest the haunted wood his sword the knot that i had tied and myself
i admit that the sound was music in mine ears
chapter xv in which we find the haunted wood   on the outskirts of the haunted wood we dismounted fastening the horses to two pines
the italian we gagged and bound across the brown mare's saddle
then as noiselessly as indians we entered the wood
once within it it was as though the sun had suddenly sunk from the heavens
the pines of magnificent height and girth were so closely set that far overhead where the branches began was a heavy roof of foliage impervious to the sunshine brooding dark and sullen as a thundercloud over the cavernous world beneath
there was no undergrowth no clinging vines no bloom no color only the dark innumerable tree trunks and the purplishbrown scented and slippery earth
the air was heavy cold and still like cave air the silence as blank and awful as the silence beneath the earth
the minister and i stole through the dusk and for a long time heard nothing but our own breathing and the beating of our hearts
but coming to a sluggish stream as quiet as the wood through which it crept and following its slow windings we at last heard a voice and in the distance made out dark forms sitting on the earth beside that sombre water
we went on with caution gliding from tree to tree and making no noise
in the cheerless silence of that place any sound would have shattered the stillness like a pistol shot
presently we came to a halt and ourselves hidden by a giant trunk looked out on stealers and stolen
they were gathered on the bank of the stream waiting for the boat from the santa teresa
the lady whom we sought lay like a fallen flower on the dark ground beneath a pine
she did not move and her eyes were shut
at her head crouched the negress her white garments showing ghostlike through the gloom
beneath the next tree sat diccon his hands tied behind him and around him my lord carnal's four knaves
it was diccon's voice that we had heard
he was still speaking and now we could distinguish the words
so sir thomas chains him there he saidright there to that tree under which you are sitting jacky bonhomme jacques incontinently shifted his position
he chains him there with one chain around his neck one around his waist and one around his ankles
then he sticks me a bodkin through his tongue a groan of admiration from his audience
then they dig before his very eyes a graveshallow enough they make it tooand they put into it uncoffined with only a long white shroud upon him the man he murdered
then they cover the grave
you're sitting on it now you other jacky  godam cried the rascal addressed and removed with expedition to a less storied piece of ground
then they go away continued diccon in graveyard tones
they all go away togethersir thomas and captain argall captain west lieutenant george percy and his cousin my master and sir thomas's men they go out of the wood as though it were accursed though indeed it was not half so gloomy then as it is now
the sun shone into it then sometimes and the birds sang
you would n't think it from the looks of things now would you
as the dead man rotted in his grave and the living man died by inches above him they say the wood grew darker and darker and darker
how dark it's getting now and coldcold as the dead  his auditors drew closer together and shivered
sparrow and i were so near that we could see the hands of the ingenious storyteller bound behind his back working as he talked
now they strained this way and now that at the piece of rope that bound them
that was ten years ago he said his voice becoming more and more impressive
since that day nothing comes into this woodnothing human that is
neither white man nor indian comes that's certain
then why are n't there chains around that tree and why are there no bones beneath it on the ground there
because jackies all the man that did that murder walks
it is not always deadly still here sometimes there 's a clanking of chains
and a bodkin through the tongue can't keep the dead from wailing
and the murdered man walks too in his shroud he follows the otheris n't that something white in the distance yonder  my lord's four knaves looked down the arcade of trees and saw the something white as plainly as if it had been verily there
each moment the wood grew darkera thing in nature since the sun outside was swiftly sinking to the horizon
but to those to whom that tale had been told it was a darkening unearthly and portentous bringing with it a colder air and a deepened silence
oh sir thomas dale sir thomas dale  the voice seemed to come from the distance and bore in its dismal cadence the melancholy of the damned
for a moment my heart stood still and the hair of my head commenced to rise the next i knew that diccon had found an ally not in the dead but in the living
the minister standing beside me opened his mouth again and again that dismal voice rang through the wood and again it seemed by i know not what art to come from any spot rather than from that particular tree behind whose trunk stood master jeremy sparrow
oh the bodkin through my tongue
oh the bodkin through my tongue  two of the guard sat with hanging lip and lacklustre eyes turned to stone one at full length upon the ground bruised his face against the pine needles and called on the virgin the fourth panicstricken leaped to his feet and dashed off into the darkness to trouble us no more that day
oh the heavy chains cried the unseen spectre
oh the dead man in his grave  the man on his face dug his nails into the earth and howled his fellows were too frightened for sound or motion
diccon a hardy rogue with little fear of god or man gave no sign of perturbation beyond a desperate tugging at the rope about his wrists
he was ever quick to take suggestion and he had probably begun to question the nature of the ghost who was doing him such yeoman service
d' ye think they've had enough said sparrow in my ear
my invention flaggeth  i nodded too choked with laughter for speech and drew my sword
the next moment we were upon the men like wolves upon the fold
they made no resistance
amazed and shaken as they were we might have dispatched them with all ease to join the dead whose lamentations yet rang in their ears but we contented ourselves with disarming them and bidding them begone for their lives in the direction of the pamunkey
they went like frightened deer their one goal in life escape from the wood
did you meet the italian  i turned to find my wife at my side
the king's ward had a kingly spirit she was not one that the dead or the living could daunt
to her as to me danger was a trumpet call to nerve heart and strengthen soul
she had been in peril of that which she most feared but the light in her eye was not quenched and the hand with which she touched mine though cold was steady
is he dead she asked
at court they called him the black death
they said  i did not kill him i answered but i will if you desire it  and his master she demanded
what have you done with his master  i told her
at the vision my words conjured up her strained nerves gave way and she broke into laughter as cruel as it was sweet
peal after peal rang through the haunted wood and increased the eeriness of the place
the knot that i tied he will untie directly i said
if we would reach jamestown first we had best be going  night is upon us too said the minister and this place hath the look of the very valley of the shadow of death
if the spirits walk it is hard upon their timeand i prefer to walk elsewhere  cease your laughter madam i said
should a boat be coming up this stream you would betray us  i went over to diccon and in a silence as grim as his own cut the rope which bound his hands which done we all moved through the deepening gloom to where we had left the horses jeremy sparrow going on ahead to have them in readiness
presently he came hurrying back
the italian is gone he cried
gone i exclaimed
i told you to tie him fast to the saddle  why so i did he replied
i drew the thongs so tight that they cut into his flesh
he could not have endured to pull against them  then how did he get away  why he answered with a rueful countenance i did bind him as i have said but when i had done so i bethought me of how the leather must cut and of how pain is dreadful even to a snake and of the injunction to do as you would be done by and so e'en loosened his bonds
but as i am a christened man i thought that they would yet hold him fast  i began to swear but ended in vexed laughter
the milk's spilt
there 's no use in crying over it
after all we must have loosed him before we entered the town  will you not bring the matter before the governor he asked
i shook my head
if yeardley did me right he would put in jeopardy his office and his person
this is my private quarrel and i will draw no man into it against his will
here are the horses and we had best be gone for by this time my lord and his physician may have their heads together again  i mounted black lamoral and lifted mistress percy to a seat behind me
the brown mare bore the minister and the negress and diccon doggedly silent trudged beside us
we passed through the haunted wood and the painted forest beyond without adventure
we rode in silence the lady behind me too weary for speech the minister revolving in his mind the escape of the italian and i with my own thoughts to occupy me
it was dusk when we crossed the neck of land and as we rode down the street torches were being lit in the houses
the upper room in the guest house was brightly illumined and the window was open
black lamoral and the brown mare made a trampling with their hoofs and i began to whistle a gay old tune i had learnt in the wars
a figure in scarlet and black came to the window and stood there looking down upon us
the lady riding with me straightened herself and raised her weary head
the next time we go to the forest ralph  she said in a clear high voice thou 'lt show me a certain tree and she broke into silvery laughter
she laughed until we had left behind the guest house and the figure in the upper window and then the laughter changed to something like a sob
if there were pain and anger in her heart pain and anger were in mine also
she had never called me by my name before
she had only used it now as a dagger with which to stab at that fierce heart above us
at last we reached the minister's house and dismounted before the door
diccon led the horses away and i handed my wife into the great room
the minister tarried but for a few words anent some precautions that i meant to take and then betook himself to his own chamber
as he went out of the door diccon entered the room
oh i am weary sighed mistress jocelyn percy
what was the mighty business captain percy that made you break tryst with a lady
you should go to court sir to be taught gallantry  where should a wife go to be taught obedience i demanded
you know where i went and why i could not keep tryst
why did you not obey my orders  she opened wide her eyes
your orders
i never received anynot that i should have obeyed them if i had
know where you went
i know neither why nor where you went  i leaned my hand upon the table and looked from her to diccon
i was sent by the governor to quell a disturbance amongst the nearest indians
the woods today have been full of danger
moreover the plan that we made yesterday was overheard by the italian
when i had to go this morning without seeing you i left you word where i had gone and why and also my commands that you should not stir outside the garden
were you not told this madam  no she cried
i looked at diccon
i told madam that you were called away on business he said sullenly
i told her that you were sorry you could not go with her to the woods  you told her nothing more  no  may i ask why  he threw back his head
i did not believe the paspaheghs would trouble her he answered with hardihood and you had n't seen fit sir to tell me of the other danger
madam wanted to go and i thought it a pity that she should lose her pleasure for nothing  i had been hunting the day before and my whip yet lay upon the table
i have known you for a hardy rogue i said with my hand upon it now i know you for a faithless one as well
if i gave you credit for all the vices of the soldier i gave you credit also for his virtues
i was the more deceived
the disobedient servant i might pardon but the soldier who is faithless to his trust  i raised the whip and brought it down again and again across his shoulders
he stood without a word his face dark red and his hands clenched at his sides
for a minute or more there was no sound in the room save the sound of the blows then my wife suddenly cried out it is enough
you have beaten him enough
let him go sir  i threw down the whip
begone sirrah i ordered
and keep out of my sight tomorrow  with his face still dark red and with a pulse beating fiercely in his cheek he moved slowly toward the door turned when he had reached it and saluted then went out and closed it after him
now he too will be your enemy said mistress percy and all through me
i have brought you many enemies have i not
perhaps you count me amongst them
i should not wonder if you did
do you not wish me gone from virginia  so i were with you madam i said bluntly and went to call the minister down to supper
chapter xvi in which i am rid of an unprofitable servant   the next day governor and councilors sat to receive presents from the paspaheghs and to listen to long and affectionate messages from opechancanough who like the player queen did protest too much
the council met at yeardley's house and i was called before it to make my report of the expedition of the day before
it was late afternoon when the governor dismissed us and i found myself leaving the house in company with master pory
i am bound for my lord's said that worthy as we neared the guest house
my lord hath xeres wine that is the very original nectar of the gods and he drinks it from goblets worth a king's ransom
we have heard a deal today about burying hatchets bury thine for the nonce ralph percy and come drink with us  not i i said
i would sooner drink withsome one else  he laughed
here's my lord himself shall persuade you  my lord dressed with his usual magnificence and darkly handsome as ever was indeed standing within the guesthouse door
pory drew up beside him
i was passing on with a slight bow when the secretary caught me by the sleeve
at the governor's house wine had been set forth to revive the jaded council and he was already half seas over
tarry with us captain he cried
good wine's good wine no matter who pours it
's bud
in my young days men called a truce and forgot they were foes when the bottle went round  if captain percy will stay quoth my lord i will give him welcome and good wine
as master pory says men cannot be always fighting
a breathing spell today gives tomorrow's struggle new zest  he spoke frankly with open face and candid eyes
i was not fooled
if yesterday he would have slain me only in fair fight it was not so today
under the lace that fell over his wrist was a red cirque the mark of the thong with which i had bound him
as if he had told me i knew that he had thrown his scruples to the winds and that he cared not what foul play he used to sweep me from his path
my spirit and my wit rose to meet the danger
of a sudden i resolved to accept his invitation
so be it i said with a laugh and a shrug of my shoulders
a cup of wine is no great matter
i'll take it at your hands my lord and drink to our better acquaintance  we all three went up into my lord's room
the king had fitted out his minion bravely for the virginia voyage and the riches that had decked the state cabin aboard the santa teresa now served to transform the bare room in the guest house at jamestown into a corner of whitehall
the walls were hung with arras there was a noble carpet beneath as well as upon the table and against the wall stood richly carved trunks
on the table beside a bowl of late flowers were a great silver flagon and a number of goblets some of chased silver and some of colored glass strangely shaped and fragile as an eggshell
the late sun now shining in at the open window made the glass to glow like precious stones
my lord rang a little silver bell and a door behind us was opened
wine giles cried my lord in a raised voice
wine for master pory captain percy and myself
and giles my two choice goblets  giles whom i had never seen before advanced to the table took the flagon and went toward the door which he had shut behind him
i negligently turned in my seat and so came in for a glimpse as he slipped through the door of a figure in black in the next room
the wine was brought and with it two goblets
my lord broke off in the midst of an account of the morning's bearbaiting which the tediousness of the indians had caused us to miss
who knows if we three shall ever drink together again he said
to honor this bout i use my most precious cups voice and manner were free and unconstrained
this gold cup he held it upbelonged to the medici
master pory who is a man of taste will note the beauty of the graven maenads upon this side and of the bacchus and ariadne upon this
it is the work of none other than benvenuto cellini
i pour for you sir he filled the gold cup with the ruby wine and set it before the secretary who eyed it with all the passion of a lover and waited not for us but raised it to his lips at once
my lord took up the other cup
this glass he continued as green as an emerald freckled inside and out with gold and shaped like a lily was once amongst a convent's treasures
my father brought it from italy years ago
i use it as he used it only on gala days
i fill to you sir he poured the wine into the green and gold and twisted bauble and set it before me then filled a silver goblet for himself
drink gentlemen he said
faith i have drunken already quoth the secretary and proceeded to fill for himself a second time
here's to you gentlemen and he emptied half the measure
captain percy does not drink remarked my lord
i leaned my elbow upon the table and holding up the glass against the light began to admire its beauty
the tint is wonderful i said as lucent a green as the top of the comber that is to break and overwhelm you
and these knobs of gold within and without and the strange shape the tortured glass has been made to take
i find it of a quite sinister beauty my lord  it hath been much admired said the nobleman addressed
i am strangely suited my lord i went on still dreamily enjoying the beauty of the green gem within my clasp
i am a soldier with an imagination
sometimes to give the rein to my fancy pleases me more than wine
now this strange chalicemight it not breed dreams as strange  when i had drunken i think replied my lord
the wine would be a potent spur to my fancy  what saith honest jack falstaff broke in the maudlin secretary
doth he not bear testimony that good sherris maketh the brain apprehensive and quick filleth it with nimble fiery and delectable shapes which being delivered by the tongue become excellent wit
wherefore let us drink gentlemen and beget fancies he filled for himself again and buried his nose in the cup
't is such a cup methinks i said as medea may have filled for theseus
the white hand of circe may have closed around this stem when she stood to greet ulysses and knew not that he had the saving herb in his palm
goneril may have sent this green and gilded shape to regan
fair rosamond may have drunk from it while the queen watched her
at some voluptuous feast caesar borgia and his sister sitting crowned with roses side by side may have pressed it upon a reluctant guest who had perhaps a treasure of his own
i dare swear rene the florentine hath fingered many such a goblet before it went to whom catherine de' medici delighted to honor  she had the whitest hands maundered the secretary
i kissed them once before she died in blois when i was young
rene was one of your slow poisoners
smell a rose draw on a pair of perfumed gloves drink from a certain cup and you rang your own knell though your bier might not receive you for many and many a daynot till the rose was dust the gloves lost the cup forgotten  there's a fashion i have seen followed abroad that i like i said
host and guest fill to each other then change tankards
you are my host today my lord and i am your guest
i will drink to you my lord from your silver goblet  with as frank a manner as his own of a while before i pushed the green and gold glass over to him and held out my hand for the silver goblet
that a man may smile and smile and be a villain is no new doctrine
my lord's laugh and gesture of courtesy were as free and ready as if the poisoned splendor he drew toward him had been as innocent as a pearl within the shell
i took the silver cup from before him
i drink to the king i said and drained it to the bottom
your lordship does not drink
't is a toast no man refuses  he raised the glass to his lips but set it down before its rim had touched them
i have a headache he declared
i will not drink today  master pory pulled the flagon toward him tilted it and found it empty
his rueful face made me laugh
my lord laughed toosomewhat loudlybut ordered no more wine
i would i were at the mermaid again lamented the now drunken secretary
there we did n't split a flagon in three parts
the tsar of muscovy drinks me down a quartern of aqua vitae at a gulpi've seen him do iti would i were the bacchus on this cup with the purple grapes adangle above me wine and womenwine and women good wine needs no bush good sherris sack his voice died into unintelligible mutterings and his gray unreverend head sank upon the table
i rose leaving him to his drunken slumbers and bowing to my lord took my leave
my lord followed me down to the public room below
a party of upriver planters had been drinking and a bit of chalk lay upon a settle behind the door upon which the landlord had marked their score
i passed it then turned back and picked it up
how long a line shall i draw my lord i asked with a smile
how does the length of the door strike you he answered
i drew the chalk from top to bottom of the wood
a heavy core makes a heavy reckoning my lord i said and leaving the mark upon the door i bowed again and went out into the street
the sun was sinking when i reached the minister's house and going into the great room drew a stool to the table and sat down to think
mistress percy was in her own chamber in the room overhead the minister paced up and down humming a psalm
a fire was burning briskly upon the hearth and the red light rose and fellnow brightening all the room now leaving it to the gathering dusk
through the door which i had left open came the odor of the pines the fallen leaves and the damp earth
in the churchyard an owl hooted and the murmur of the river was louder than usual
i had sat staring at the table before me for perhaps half an hour when i chanced to raise my eyes to the opposite wall
now on this wall reflecting the firelight and the open door behind me hung a small venetian mirror which i had bought from a number of such toys brought in by the southampton and had given to mistress percy
my eyes rested upon it idly at first then closely enough as i saw within it a man enter the room
i had heard no footfall there was no noise now behind me
the fire was somewhat sunken and the room was almost in darkness i saw him in the glass dimly as shadow rather than substance
but the light was not so faint that the mirror could not show me the raised hand and the dagger within its grasp
i sat without motion watching the figure in the glass grow larger
when it was nearly upon me and the hand with the dagger drawn back for the blow i sprang up wheeled and caught it by the wrist
a moment's fierce struggle and i had the dagger in my own hand and the man at my mercy
the fire upon the hearth seized on a pine knot and blazed up brightly filling the room with light
diccon i cried and dropped my arm
i had never thought of this
the room was very quiet as master and man we stood and looked each other in the face
he fell back to the wall and leaned against it breathing heavily into the space between us the past came thronging
i opened my hand and let the dagger drop to the floor
i suppose that this was because of last night i said
i shall never strike you again  i went to the table and sitting down leaned my forehead upon my hand
it was diccon who would have done this thing
the fire crackled on the hearth as had crackled the old camp fires in flanders the wind outside was the wind that had whistled through the rigging of the treasurer one terrible night when we lashed ourselves to the same mast and never thought to see the morning
diccon
upon the table was the minister's inkhorn and pen
i drew my tablets from the breast of my doublet and began to write
diccon i called without turning when i had finished
he came slowly forward to the table and stood beside it with hanging head
i tore the leaf from the book and pushed it over to him
take it i ordered
to the commander he asked
i am to take it to the commander  i shook my head
read it  he stared at it vacantly turning it now this way now that
did you forget how to read when you forgot all else i said sternly
he read and the color rushed into his face
it is your freedom i said
you are no longer man of mine
begone sirrah  he crumpled the paper in his hand
i was mad he muttered
i could almost believe it i replied
begone  after a moment he went
sitting still in my place i heard him heavily and slowly leave the room descend the step at the door and go out into the night
a door opened and mistress jocelyn percy came into the great room like a sunbeam strayed back to earth
her skirt was of flowered satin her bodice of rich taffeta between the gossamer walls of her french ruff rose the whitest neck to meet the fairest face
upon her dark hair sat as lightly as a kiss a little pearlbordered cap
a color was in her cheeks and a laugh on her lips
the rosy light of the burning pine caressed hernow dwelling on the rich dress now on the gold chain around the slender waist now on rounded arms now on the white forehead below the pearls
well she was a fair lady for a man to lay down his life for
i held court this afternoon she cried
where were you sir
madam west was here and my lady temperance yeardley and master wynne and master thorpe from henricus and master rolfe with his indian brotherwho i protest needs but silk doublet and hose and a month at whitehall to make him a very fine gentleman  if courage steadfastness truth and courtesy make a gentleman i said he is one already
such an one needs not silk doublet nor court training  she looked at me with her bright eyes
no she repeated such an one needs not silk doublet nor court training going to the fire she stood with one hand upon the mantelshelf looking down into the ruddy hollows
presently she stooped and gathered up something from the hearth
you waste paper strangely captain percy she said
here is a whole handful of torn pieces  she came over to the table and with a laugh showered the white fragments down upon it then fell to idly piecing them together
what were you writing she asked
'to all whom it may concern i ralph percy gentleman of the hundred of weyanoke do hereby set free from all service to me and mine'  i took from her the bits of paper and fed the fire with them
paper is but paper i said
it is easily rent
happily a man's will is more durable    chapter xvii in which my lord and i play at bowls   the governor had brought with him from london the year before a set of boxwood bowls and had made between his house and the fort a noble green
the generality must still use for the game that portion of the street that was not tobaccoplanted but the quality flocked to the governor's green and here one holiday afternoon a fortnight or more from the day in which i had drunk to the king from my lord's silver goblet was gathered a very great company
the governor's match was towardten men to a side a hogshead of sweetscented to the victorious ten and a keg of canary to the man whose bowl should hit the jack
the season had been one of unusual mildness and the sunshine was still warm and bright gilding the velvet of the green and making the red and yellow leaves swept into the trench to glow like a ribbon of flame
the sky was blue the water bluer still the leaves brightcolored the wind blowing only the enshrouding forest wrapped in haze seemed as dim unreal and far away as a last year's dream
the governor's gilt armchair had been brought from the church and put for him upon the bank of turf at the upper end of the green
by his side sat my lady temperance while the gayly dressed dames and the men who were to play and to watch were accommodated with stools and settles or with seats on the green grass
all were dressed in holiday clothes all tongues spoke all eyes laughed you might have thought there was not a heavy heart amongst them
rolfe was there gravely courteous quiet and ready and by his side in otterskin mantle beaded moccasins and feathered headdress the indian chief his brotherinlawthe bravest comeliest and manliest savage with whom i have ever dealt
there too was master pory red and jovial with an eye to the sack the servants were bringing from the governor's house and the commander with his wife and master jeremy sparrow fresh from a most moving sermon on the vanities of this world
captains councilors and burgesses aired their gold lace and their wit or their lack of it while a swarm of younger adventurers youths of good blood and bad living come from home for the weal of england and the woe of virginia went here and there through the crowd like gilded summer flies
rolfe and i were to play he sat on the grass at the feet of mistress jocelyn percy making her now and then some courtly speech and i stood beside her my hand on the back of her chair
the king's ward held court as though she were a king's daughter
in the brightness of her beauty she sat there as gracious for the nonce as the sunshine and as much of another world
all knew her story and to the daring that is in men's hearts her own daring appealedand she was young and very beautiful
some there had not been my friends and now rejoiced in what seemed my inevitable ruin some whom i had thought my friends were gone over to the stronger side many who in secret wished me well still shook their heads and shrugged their shoulders over what they were pleased to call my madness but for her i was glad to know there were only good words
the governor had left his gilt armchair to welcome her to the green and had caused a chair to be set for her near his own and here men came and bowed before her as if she had been a princess indeed
a stir amongst the crowd a murmur and a craning of necks heralded the approach of that other at whom the town gaped with admiration
he came with his retinue of attendants his pomp of dress his arrogance of port his splendid beauty
men looked from the beauty of the king's ward to the beauty of the king's minion from her costly silk to his velvet and miniver from the air of the court that became her well to the towering pride and insolence which to the thoughtless seemed his fortune's proper mantle and deemed them a pair well suited and the king's will indeed the will of heaven
i was never one to value a man by his outward seeming but suddenly i saw myself as in a mirrora soldier scarred and bronzed acquainted with the camp but not with the court roughened by a rude life poor in this world's goods the first flush of youth gone forever
for a moment my heart was bitter within me
the pang passed and my hand tightened its grasp upon the chair in which sat the woman i had wed she was my wife and i would keep my own
my lord had paused to speak to the governor who had risen to greet him
now he came toward us and the crowd pressed and whispered
he bowed low to mistress percy made as if to pass on then came to a stop before her his hat in his hand his handsome head bent a smile upon his bearded lips
when was it that we last sat to see men bowl lady he said
i remember a gay match when i bowled against my lord of buckingham and fair ladies sat and smiled upon us
the fairest laughed and tied her colors around my arm  the lady whom he addressed sat quietly with hands folded in her silken lap and an untroubled face
i did not know you then my lord she answered him quite softly and sweetly
had i done so be sure i would have cut my hand off ere it gave color of mine toto whom he demanded as she paused
to a coward my lord she said clearly
as if she had been a man his hand went to his sword hilt
as for her she leaned back in her chair and looked at him with a smile
he spoke at last slowly and with deliberate emphasis
i won then he said
i shall win again my ladymy lady jocelyn leigh  i dropped my hand from her chair and stepped forward
it is my wife to whom you speak my lord carnal i said sternly
i wait to hear you name her rightly  rolfe rose from the grass and stood beside me and jeremy sparrow shouldering aside with scant ceremony burgess and councilor came also
the governor leaned forward out of his chair and the crowd became suddenly very still
i am waiting my lord i repeated
in an instant from what he had been he became the frank and guileless nobleman
a slip of the tongue captain percy he cried his white teeth showing and his hand raised in a gesture of deprecation
a natural thing seeing how often how very often i have so addressed this lady in the days when we had not the pleasure of your acquaintance he turned to her and bowed until the feather in his hat swept the ground
i won then he said
i shall win againmistress percy and passed on to the seat that had been reserved for him
the game began
i was to lead one side and young clement the other
at the last moment he came over to me
i am out of it captain percy  he announced with a rueful face
my lord there asks me to give him my place
when we were hunting yesterday and the stag turned upon me he came between and thrust his knife into the brute which else might have put an end to my hunting forever and a day so you see i can't refuse him
plague take it all
and dorothy gookin sitting there watching  my lord and i stood forward each with a bowl in his hand
we looked toward the governor
my lord first as becometh his rank he said
my lord stooped and threw and his bowl went swiftly over the grass turned and rested not a hands'breadth from the jack
i threw
one is as near as the other cried master macocke for the judges
a murmur arose from the crowd and my lord swore beneath his breath
he and i retreated to our several sides and rolfe and west took our places
while they and those that followed bowled the crowd attentive though it was still talked and laughed and laid wagers upon its favorites but when my lord and i again stood forth the noise was hushed and men and women stared with all their eyes
he delivered and his bowl touched the jack
he straightened himself with a smile and i heard jeremy sparrow behind me groan but my bowl too kissed the jack
the crowd began to laugh with sheer delight but my lord turned red and his brows drew together
we had but one turn more
while we waited i marked his black eyes studying every inch of the ground between him and that small white ball to strike which at that moment i verily believe he would have given the king's favor
all men pray though they pray not to the same god
as he stood there when his time had come weighing the bowl in his hand i knew that he prayed to his daemon fate star whatever thing he raised an altar to and bent before
he threw and i followed while the throng held its breath
master macocke rose to his feet
it's a tie my masters he exclaimed
the excited crowd surged forward and a babel of voices arose
silence all cried the governor
let them play it out  my lord threw and his bowl stopped perilously near the shining mark
as i stepped to my place a low and supplicating o lord came to my ears from the lips and the heart of the preacher who had that morning thundered against the toys of this world
i drew back my arm and threw with all my force
a cry arose from the throng and my lord ground his heel into the earth
the bowl spurning the jack before it rushed on until both buried themselves in the red and yellow leaves that filled the trench
i turned and bowed to my antagonist
you bowl well my lord i said
had you had the forest training of eye and arm our fortunes might have been reversed  he looked me up and down
you are kind sir he said thickly
'today to thee tomorrow to me'
i give you joy of your petty victory  he turned squarely from me and stood with his face downstream
i was speaking to rolfe and to the fewnot even all of that side for which i had wonwho pressed around me when he wheeled
your honor he cried to the governor who had paused beside mistress percy is not the due return highpooped
doth she not carry a blue pennant and hath she not a gilt siren for figurehead  ay answered the governor lifting his head from the hand he had kissed with ponderous gallantry
what then my lord  then tomorrow has dawned sir captain said my lord to me
sure dame venus and her blind son have begged for me favorable winds for the due return has come again  the game that had been played was forgotten for that day
the hogshead of sweet scented lying to one side wreathed with bright vines was unclaimed of either party the servants who brought forward the keg of canary dropped their burden and stared with the rest
all looked down the river and all saw the due return coming up the broad ruffled stream the wind from the sea filling her sails the tide with her the gilt mermaid on her prow just rising from the rushing foam
she came as swiftly as a bird to its nest
none had thought to see her for at least ten days
upon all there fell a sudden realization that it was the word of the king feathered by the command of the company that was hurrying arrowlike toward us
all knew what the company's orders would bemust needs beand the tudor sovereigns were not so long in the grave that men had forgot to fear the wrath of kings
the crowd drew back from me as from a man plaguespotted
only rolfe sparrow and the indian stood their ground
the governor turned from staring downstream
the game is played gentlemen he announced abruptly
the wind grows colder too and clouds are gathering
this fair company will pardon me if i dismiss them somewhat sooner than is our wont
the next sunny day we will play again
give you god den gentles  the crowd stood not upon the order of its going but streamed away to the river bank whence it could best watch the oncoming ship
my lord after a most triumphant bow swept off with his train in the direction of the guest house
with him went master pory
the governor drew nearer to me
captain percy he said lowering his voice i am going now to mine own house
the letters which yonder ship brings will be in my hands in less than an hour
when i have read them i shall perforce obey their instructions
before i have them i will see you if you so wish  i will be with your honor in five minutes  he nodded and strode off across the green to his garden
i turned to rolfe
will you take her home i said briefly
she was so white and sat so still in her chair that i feared to see her swoon
but when i spoke to her she answered clearly and steadily enough even with a smile and she would not lean upon rolfe's arm
i will walk alone she said
none that see me shall think that i am stricken down i watched her move away rolfe beside her and the indian following with his noiseless step then i went to the governor's house
master jeremy sparrow had disappeared some minutes before i knew not whither
i found yeardley in his great room standing before a fire and staring down into its hollows
captain percy he said as i went up to him i am most heartily sorry for you and for the lady whom you so ignorantly married  i shall not plead ignorance i told him
you married not the lady jocelyn leigh but a waiting woman named patience worth
the lady jocelyn leigh a noble lady and a ward of the king could not marry without the king's consent
and you captain percy are but a mere private gentleman a poor virginia adventurer and my lord carnal ismy lord carnal
the court of high commission will make short work of this fantastic marriage  then they may do it without my aid i said
come sir george had you wed my lady temperance in such fashion and found this hornets' nest about your ears what would you have done  he gave his short honest laugh
it's beside the question ralph percy but i dare say you can guess what i would have done  i'll fight for my own to the last ditch i continued
i married her knowing her name if not her quality
had i known the latter had i known she was the king's ward all the same i should have married her an she would have had me
she is my wife in the sight of god and honest men
esteeming her honor which is mine at stake death may silence me but men shall not bend me  your best hope is in my lord of buckingham he said
they say it is out of sight out of mind with the king and thanks to this infatuation of my lord carnal's buckingham hath the field
that he strains every nerve to oust completely this his first rival since he himself distanced somerset goes without saying
that to thwart my lord in this passion would be honey to him is equally of course
i do not need to tell you that if the company so orders i shall have no choice but to send you and the lady home to england
when you are in london make your suit to my lord of buckingham and i earnestly hope that you may find in him an ally powerful enough to bring you and the lady to whose grace beauty and courage we all do homage out of this coil  we give you thanks sir i said
as you know he went on i have written to the company humbly petitioning that i be graciously relieved from a most thankless task to wit the governorship of virginia
my health faileth and i am moreover under my lord warwick's displeasure
he waxeth ever stronger in the company and if i put not myself out he will do it for me
if i be relieved at once and one of the council appointed in my place i shall go home to look after certain of my interests there
then shall i be but a private gentleman and if i can serve you ralph percy i shall be blithe to do so but now you understand  i understand and thank you sir george i said
may i ask one question  what is it  will you obey to the letter the instructions the company sends  to the letter he answered
i am its sworn officer  one thing more i went on the parole i gave you sir that morning behind the church is mine own again when you shall have read those letters and know the king's will
i am free from that bond at least  he looked at me with a frown
make not bad worse captain percy he said sternly
i laughed
it is my aim to make bad better sir george
i see through the window that the due return hath come to anchor i will no longer trespass on your honor's time i bowed myself out leaving him still with the frown upon his face staring at the fire
without the world was bathed in the glow of a magnificent sunset
clouds dark purple and dark crimson reared themselves in the west to dizzy heights and hung threateningly over the darkening land beneath
in the east loomed more pallid masses and from the bastions of the east to the bastions of the west went hurrying winddriven cloudless dark in the east red in the west
there was a high wind and the river where it was not reddened by the sunset was lividly green
a storm too i muttered
as i passed the guest house there came to me from within a burst of loud and vaunting laughter and a boisterous drinking catch sung by many voices and i knew that my lord drank and gave others to drink to the orders which the due return should bring
the minister's house was in darkness
in the great room i struck a light and fired the fresh torches and found i was not its sole occupant
on the hearth the ashes of the dead fire touching her skirts sat mistress jocelyn percy her arms resting upon a low stool and her head pillowed upon them
her face was not hidden it was cold and pure and still like carven marble
i stood and gazed at her a moment then as she did not offer to move i brought wood to the fire and made the forlorn room bright again
where is rolfe i asked at last
he would have stayed she answered but i made him go
i wished to be alone she rose and going to the window leaned her forehead against the bars and looked out upon the wild sky and the hurrying river
i would i were alone she said in a low voice and with a catch of her breath
as she stood there in the twilight by the window i knew that she was weeping though her pride strove to keep that knowledge from me
my heart ached for her and i knew not how to comfort her
at last she turned
a pasty and stoup of wine were upon the table
you are tired and shaken i said and you may need all your strength
come eat and drink  for tomorrow we die she added and broke into tremulous laughter
her lashes were still wet but her pride and daring had returned
she drank the wine i poured for her and we spoke of indifferent thingsof the game that afternoon of the indian nantauquas of the wild night that clouds and wind portended
supper over i called angela to bear her company and i myself went out into the night and down the street toward the guest house
chapter xviii in which we go out into the night   the guest house was aflame with lights
as i neared it there was borne to my ears a burst of drunken shouts accompanied by a volley of musketry
my lord was pursuing with a vengeance our senseless fashion of wasting in drinking bouts powder that would have been better spent against the indians
the noise increased
the door was flung open and there issued a tide of drawers and servants headed by mine host himself and followed by a hail of such minor breakables as the house contained and by olympian laughter
i made my way past the indignant host and his staff and standing upon the threshold looked at the riot within
the long room was thick with the smoke of tobacco and the smoke of powder through which the many torches burned yellow
upon the great table wine had been spilt and dripped to swell a red pool upon the floor
underneath the table still grasping his empty tankard lay the first of my lord's guests to fall an upriver burgess with white hair
the rest of the company were fast reeling to a like fate
young hamor had a fiddle and one foot upon a settle the other upon the table drew across it a fast and furious bow
master pory arrived at the maudlin stage alternately sang a slow and melancholy ditty and wiped the tears from his eyes with elaborate care
master edward sharpless now in a high voice now in an undistinguishable murmur argued some imaginary case
peaceable sherwood was drunk and giles allen and pettiplace clause
captain john martin sitting with outstretched legs called now for a fresh tankard which he emptied at a gulp now for his pistols which as fast as my lord's servants brought them to him new primed he discharged at the ceiling
the loud wind rattled doors and windows and made the flame of the torches stream sideways
the music grew madder and madder the shots more frequent the drunken voices thicker and louder
the master of the feast carried his wine better than did his guests or had drunk less but his spirit too was quite without bounds
a color burned in his cheeks a wicked light in his eyes he laughed to himself
in the gray smoke cloud he saw me not or saw me only as one of the many who thronged the doorway and stared at the revel within
he raised his silver cup with a slow and wavering hand
drink you dogs he chanted
drink to the santa teresa
drink to tomorrow night
drink to a proud lady within my arms and an enemy in my power  the wine that had made him mad had maddened those others also
in that hour they were dead to honor
with shameless laughter and as little spilling as might be they raised their tankards as my lord raised his
a stone thrown by some one behind me struck the cup from my lord's hand sending it clattering to the floor and dashing him with the red wine
master pory roared with drunken laughter
cup and lip missed that time he cried
the man who had thrown the stone was jeremy sparrow
for one instant i saw his great figure and the wrathful face beneath his shock of grizzled hair the next he had made his way through the crowd of gaping menials and was gone
my lord stared foolishly at the stains upon his hands at the fallen goblet and the stone beside it
cogged dice he said thickly or i had not lost that throw
i'll drink that toast by myself tomorrow night when the ship does n't rock like this dd floor and the sea has no stones to throw
more wine giles
to my lord high admiral gentlemen
to his grace of buckingham
may he shortly howl in hell and looking back to whitehall see me upon the king's bosom
the king 's a good king gentlemen
he gave me this ruby
d' ye know what i had of him last year
i  i turned and left the door and the house
i could not thrust a fight upon a drunken man
ten yards away suddenly and without any warning of his approach i found beside me the indian nantauquas
i have been to the woods to hunt he said in the slow musical english rolfe had taught him
i knew where a panther lodged and today i laid a snare and took him in it
i brought him to my brother's house and caged him there
when i have tamed him i shall give him to the beautiful lady  he expected no answer and i gave him none
there are times when an indian is the best company in the world
just before we reached the market place we had to pass the mouth of a narrow lane leading down to the river
the night was very dark though the stars still shone through rifts in the ever moving clouds
the indian and i walked rapidly onmy footfalls sounding clear and sharp on the frosty ground he as noiseless as a shadow
we had reached the further side of the lane when he put forth an arm and plucked from the blackness a small black figure
in the middle of the square was kept burning a great brazier filled with pitched wood
it was the duty of the watch to keep it flaming from darkness to dawn
we found it freshly heaped with pine and its red glare lit a goodly circle
the indian pinioning the wrists of his captive with his own hand of steel dragged him with us into this circle of light
looking for simples once more learned doctor i demanded
he mowed and jabbered twisting this way and that in the grasp of the indian
loose him i said to the latter but let him not come too near you
why worthy doctor in so wild and threatening a night when fire is burning and wine flowing at the guest house do you choose to crouch here in the cold and darkness  he looked at me with his filmy eyes and that faint smile that had more of menace in it than a panther's snarl
i laid in wait for you it is true noble sir he said in his thin dreamy voice but it was for your good
i would give you warning sir  he stood with his mean figure bent cringingly forward and with his hat in his hand
a warning sir he went ramblingly on
maybe a certain one has made me his enemy
maybe i cut myself loose from his service
maybe i would do him an ill turn
i can tell you a secret sir he lowered his voice and looked around as if in fear of eavesdroppers
in your ear sir he said
i recoiled
stand back i cried or you will cull no more simples this side of hell  hell he answered
there's no such place
i will not tell my secret aloud  nicolo the italian
nicolo the poisoner
nicolo the black death
i am coming for the soul you sold me
there is a hell  the thundering voice came from underneath our feet
with a sound that was not a groan and not a screech the italian reeled back against the heated iron of the brazier
starting from that fiery contact with an unearthly shriek he threw up his arms and dashed away into the darkness
the sound of his madly hurrying footsteps came back to us until the guest house had swallowed him and his guilty terrors
can the preacher play the devil too i asked as sparrow came up to us from the other side of the fire
i could have sworn that that voice came from the bowels of the earth
't is the strangest gift  a mere trick he said with his great laugh but it has served me well on more occasions than one
it is not known in virginia sir but before ever the word of the lord came to me to save poor silly souls i was a player
once i played the king's ghost in will shakespeare's 'hamlet' and then i warrant you i spoke from the cellarage indeed
i so frighted players and playgoers that they swore it was witchcraft and burbage's knees did knock together in dead earnest
but to the matter in hand
when i had thrown yonder stone i walked quietly down to the governor's house and looked through the window
the governor hath the company's letters and he and the councilall save the reprobate porysit there staring at them and drumming with their fingers on the table  is rolfe of the council i asked
ay he was speakingfor you i suppose though i heard not the words
they all listened but they all shook their heads  we shall know in the morning i said
the night grows wilder and honest folks should be abed
nantauquas goodnight
when will you have tamed your panther  it is now the moon of cohonks answered the indian
when the moon of blossoms is here the panther shall roll at the beautiful lady's feet  the moon of blossoms i said
the moon of blossoms is a long way off
i have panthers myself to tame before it comes
this wild night gives one wild thoughts master sparrow
the loud wind and the sound of the water and the hurrying cloudswho knows if we shall ever see the moon of blossoms i broke off with a laugh for my own weakness
it's not often that a soldier thinks of death i said
come to bed reverend sir
nantauquas again goodnight and may you tame your panther  in the great room of the minister's house i paced up and down now pausing at the window to look out upon the fast darkening houses of the town the ever thickening clouds and the bending trees now speaking to my wife who sat in the chair i had drawn for her before the fire her hands idle in her lap her head thrown back against the wood her face white and still with wide dark eyes
we waited for we knew not what but the light still burned in the governor's house and we could not sleep and leave it there
it grew later and later
the wind howled down the chimney and i heaped more wood upon the fire
the town lay in darkness now only in the distance burned like an angry star the light in the governor's house
in the lull between the blasts of wind it was so very still that the sound of my footfalls upon the floor the dropping of the charred wood upon the hearth the tapping of the withered vines without the window jarred like thunder
suddenly madam leaned forward in her chair
there is some one at the door she said
as she spoke the latch rose and some one pushed heavily against the door
i had drawn the bars across
who is it i demanded going to it
it is diccon sir replied a guarded voice outside
i beg of you for the lady's sake to let me speak to you  i opened the door and he crossed the threshold
i had not seen him since the night he would have played the assassin
i had heard of him as being in martin's hundred with which plantation and its turbulent commander the debtor and the outlaw often found sanctuary
what is it sirrah i inquired sternly
he stood with his eyes upon the floor twirling his cap in his hands
he had looked once at madam when he entered but not at me
when he spoke there was the old bravado in his voice and he threw up his head with the old reckless gesture
though i am no longer your man sir he said yet i hope that one christian may warn another
the marshal with a dozen men at his heels will be here anon  how do you know  why i was in the shadow by the governor's window when the parson played eavesdropper
when he was gone i drew myself up to the ledge and with my knife made a hole in the shutter that fitted my ear well enough
the governor and the council sat there with the company's letters spread upon the table
i heard the letters read
sir george yeardley's petition to be released from the governorship of virginia is granted but he will remain in office until the new governor sir francis wyatt can arrive in virginia
the company is out of favor
the king hath sent sir edwyn sandys to the tower
my lord warwick waxeth greater every day
the very life of the company dependeth upon the pleasure of the king and it may not defy him
you are to be taken into custody within six hours of the reading of the letter to be kept straitly until the sailing of the santa teresa and to be sent home aboard of her in irons
the lady is to go also with all honor and with women to attend her
upon reaching london you are to be sent to the tower the lady to whitehall
the court of high commission will take the matter under consideration at once
my lord of southampton writes that because of the urgent entreaty of sir george yeardley he will do for you all that lieth in his power but that if you prove not yourself conformable there will be little that any can do  when will the marshal be here i demanded
directly
the governor was sending for him when i left the window
master rolfe spoke vehemently for you and would have left the council to come to you but the governor swearing that the company should not be betrayed by its officers constrained him to remain
i'm not the company's officer so i may tell its orders if i please
a masterless man may speak without fear or favor
i have told you all i know before i could speak he was gone closing the door heavily behind him
i turned to the king's ward
she had risen from the chair and now stood in the centre of the room one hand at her bosom the other clenched at her side her head thrown up
she looked as she had looked at weyanoke that first night
madam i said under my breath
she turned her face upon me
did you think she asked in a low even voicedid you think that i would ever set my foot upon that shipthat ship on the river there
one ship brought me here upon a shameful errand another shall not take me upon one more shameful still  she took her hand from her bosom in it gleamed in the firelight the small dagger i had given her that night
she laid it on the table but kept her hand upon it
you will choose for me sir she declared
i went to the door and looked out
it is a wild night i said
i can suit it with as wild an enterprise
make a bundle of your warmest clothing madam and wrap your mantle about you
will you take angela  no she answered
i will not have her peril too upon me  as she stood there her hand no longer upon the dagger the large tears welled into her eyes and fell slowly over her white cheeks
it is for mine honor sir she said
i know that i ask your death  i could not bear to see her weep and so i spoke roughly
i have told you before i said that your honor is my honor
do you think i would sleep tomorrow night in the hold of the santa teresa knowing that my wife supped with my lord carnal  i crossed the room to take my pistols from the rack
as i passed her she caught my hand in hers and bending pressed her lips upon it
you have been very good to me she murmured
do not think me an ingrate  five minutes later she came from her own room hooded and mantled and with a packet of clothing in her hand
i extinguished the torches then opened the door
as we crossed the threshold we paused as by one impulse and looked back into the firelit warmth of the room then i closed the door softly behind us and we went out into the night
chapter xix in which we have unexpected company   the wind which had heretofore come in fierce blasts was now steadying to a gale
what with the flying of the heaped clouds the slanting groaning pines and the rushing of the river the whole earth seemed a fugitive fleeing breathless to the sea
from across the neck of land came the longdrawn howl of wolves and in the wood beyond the church a catamount screamed and screamed
the town before us lay as dark and as still as the grave from the garden where we were we could not see the governor's house
i will carry madam's bundle said a voice behind us
it was the minister who had spoken and he now stood beside us
there was a moment's silence then i said with a laugh we are not going upon a summer jaunt friend sparrow
there is a warm fire in the great room to which your reverence had best betake yourself out of this windy night  as he made no movement to depart but instead possessed himself of mistress percy's bundle i spoke again with some impatience we are no longer of your fold reverend sir but are bound for another parish
we give you hearty thanks for your hospitality and wish you a very good night  as i spoke i would have taken the bundle from him but he tucked it under his arm and passing us opened the garden gate
did i forget to tell you he said that worthy master bucke is well of the fever and returns to his own tomorrow
his house and church are no longer mine
i have no charge anywhere
i am free and footloose
may i not go with you madam
there may be dragons to slay and two can guard a distressed princess better than one
will you take me for your squire captain percy  he held out his great hand and after a moment i put my own in it
we left the garden and struck into a lane
the river then instead of the forest he asked in a low voice
ay i answered
of the two evils it seems the lesser  how about a boat  my own is fastened to the piles of the old deserted wharf  you have with you neither food nor water  both are in the boat
i have kept her victualed for a week or more  he laughed in the darkness and i heard my wife beside me utter a stifled exclamation
the lane that we were now in ran parallel to the street to within fifty yards of the guest house when it bent sharply down to the river
we moved silently and with caution for some night bird might accost us or the watch come upon us
in the guest house all was darkness save one roomthe upper roomfrom which came a very pale light
when we had turned with the lane there were no houses to pass only gaunt pines and copses of sumach
i took my wife by the hand and hurried her on
a hundred yards before us ran the river dark and turbulent and between us and it rose an old unsafe and abandoned landing
sparrow laid his hand upon my arm
footsteps behind us he whispered
without slackening pace i turned my head and looked
the clouds high around the horizon were thinning overhead and the moon herself invisible yet lightened the darkness below
the sandy lane stretched behind us like a ribbon of twilightnothing to be seen but it and the ebony mass of bush and tree lining it on either side
we hastened on
a minute later and we heard behind us a sound like the winding of a small horn clear shrill and sweet
sparrow and i wheeledand saw nothing
the trees ran down to the very edge of the wharf upon whose rotten loosened and noisy boards we now trod
suddenly the clouds above us broke and the moon shone forth whitening the mountainous clouds the ridged and angry river and the low treefringed shore
below us fastened to the piles and rocking with the waves was the open boat in which we were to embark
a few broken steps led from the boards above to the water below
descending these i sprang into the boat and held out my arms for mistress percy
sparrow gave her to me and i lifted her down beside me then turned to give what aid i might to the minister who was halfway down the stepsand faced my lord carnal
what devil had led him forth on such a night why he whom with my own eyes three hours agone i had seen drunken should have chosen after his carouse cold air and his own company rather than sleep when and where he first spied us how long he had followed us i have never known
perhaps he could not sleep for triumph had heard of my impending arrest had come forth to add to the bitterness of my cup by his presence and so had happened upon us
he could only have guessed at those he followed until he reached the edge of the wharf and looked down upon us in the moonlight
for a moment he stood without moving then he raised his hand to his lips and the shrill call that had before startled us rang out again
at the far end of the lane lights appeared
men were coming down the lane at a run whether they were the watch or my lord's own rogues we tarried not to see
there was not time to loosen the rope from the piles so i drew my knife to cut it
my lord saw the movement and sprang down the steps at the same time shouting to the men behind to hasten
sparrow grappling with him locked him in a giant's embrace lifted him bodily from the steps and flung him into the boat
his head struck against a thwart and he lay huddled beneath it quiet enough
the minister sprang after him and i cut the rope
by now the wharf shook with running feet and the backwardstreaming flame of the torches reddened its boards and the black water beneath but each instant the water widened between us and our pursuers
wind and current swept us out and at that wharf there were no boats to follow us
those whom my lord's whistle had brought were now upon the very edge of the wharf
the marshal's voice called upon us in the name of the king to return
finding that we vouchsafed no answer he pulled out a pistol and fired the ball going through my hat then whipped out its fellow and fired again
mistress percy whose behavior had been that of an angel stirred in her seat
i did not know until the day broke that the ball had grazed her arm drenching her sleeve with blood
it is time we were away i said with a laugh
if your reverence will keep your hand upon the tiller and your eye upon the gentleman whom you have made our traveling companion i'll put up the sail  i was on my way to the foremast when the boom lying prone before me rose
slowly and majestically the sail ascended tapering upward silvered by the moonthe great white pinion which should bear us we knew not whither
i stopped short in my tracks mistress percy drew a sobbing breath and the minister gasped with admiration
we all three stared as though the white cloth had veritably been a monster wing endowed with life
sails don't rise of themselves i exclaimed and was at the mast before the words were out of my lips
crouched behind it was a man
i should have known him even without the aid of the moon
often enough god knows i had seen him crouched like this beside me ourselves in ambush awaiting some unwary foe brute or human or ourselves in hiding holding our breath lest it should betray us
the minister who had been a player the rival who would have poisoned me the servant who would have stabbed me the wife who was wife in name onlymine were strange shipmates
he rose to his feet and stood there against the mast in the old halfsubmissive halfdefiant attitude with his head thrown back in the old way
if you order me sir i will swim ashore he said half sullenly halfi know not how
you would never reach the shore i replied
and you know that i will never order you again
stay here if you please or come aft if you please  i went back and took the tiller from sparrow
we were now in midriver and the swollen stream and the strong wind bore us on with them like a leaf before the gale
we left behind the lights and the clamor the dark town and the silent fort the weary due return and the shipping about the lower wharf
before us loomed the santa teresa we passed so close beneath her huge black sides that we heard the wind whistling through her rigging
when she too was gone the river lay bare before us silver when the moon shone of an inky blackness when it was obscured by one of the many flying clouds
my wife wrapped her mantle closer about her and leaning back in her seat in the stern beside me raised her face to the wild and solemn heavens
diccon sat apart in the bow and held his tongue
the minister bent over and lifting the man that lay in the bottom of the boat laid him at full length upon the thwart before us
the moonlight streamed down upon the prostrate figure
i think it could never have shone upon a more handsome or a more wicked man
he lay there in his splendid dress and dark beauty endymionlike beneath the moon
the king's ward turned her eyes upon him kept them there a moment then glanced away and looked at him no more
there's a parlous lump upon his forehead where it struck the thwart  said the minister but the life's yet in him
he'll shame honest men for many a day to come
your platonists who from a goodly outside argue as fair a soul could never have been acquainted with this gentleman  the subject of his discourse moaned and stirred
the minister raised one of the hanging hands and felt for the pulse
faint enough he went on
a little more and the king might have waited for his minion forever and a day
it would have been the better for us who have now indeed a strange fish upon our hands but i am glad i killed him not  i tossed him a flask
it's good aqua vitae and the flask is honest
give him to drink of it  he forced the liquor between my lord's teeth then dashed water in his face
another minute and the king's favorite sat up and looked around him
dazed as yet he stared with no comprehension in his eyes at the clouds the sail the rushing water the dark figures about him
nicolo he cried sharply
he's not here my lord i said
at the sound of my voice he sprang to his feet
i should advise your lordship to sit still i said
the wind is very boisterous and we are not under bare poles
if you exert yourself you may capsize the boat  he sat down mechanically and put his hand to his forehead
i watched him curiously
it was the strangest trick that fortune had played him
his hand dropped at last and he straightened himself with a long breath
who threw me into the boat he demanded
the honor was mine declared the minister
the king's minion lacked not the courage of the body nor when passionate action had brought him naught a certain reserve force of philosophy
he now did the best thing he could have doneburst into a roar of laughter
zooks he cried
it's as good a comedy as ever i saw
how's the play to end captain
are we to go off laughing or is the end to be bloody after all
for instance is there murder to be done he looked at me boldly one hand on his hip the other twirling his mustaches
we are not all murderers my lord i told him
for the present you are in no danger other than that which is common to us all  he looked at the clouds piling behind us thicker and thicker higher and higher at the bending mast at the black water swirling now and again over the gunwales
it's enough he muttered
i beckoned to diccon and putting the tiller into his hands went forward to reef the sail
when it was done and i was back in my place my lord spoke again
where are we going captain  i don't know  if you leave that sail up much longer you will land us at the bottom of the river  there are worse places i replied
he left his seat and moved though with caution to one nearer mistress percy
are cold and storm and peril sweeter to you lady than warmth and safety and a love that would guard you from not run you into danger he said in a whisper
do you not wish this boat the santa teresa these rude boards the velvet cushions of her state cabin this darkness her many lights this cold her warmth with the night shut out and love shut in  his audacity if it angered me yet made me laugh
not so with the king's ward
she shrank from him until she pressed against the tiller
our flight the pursuing feet the struggle at the wharf her wounded arm of which she had not told the terror of the white sail rising as if by magic the vision of the man she hated lying as one dead before her in the moonlight the cold the hurry of the nightsmall wonder if her spirit failed her for some time
i felt her hand touch mine where it rested upon the tiller
captain percy she murmured with a little sobbing breath
i leaned across the tiller and addressed the favorite
my lord i said courtesy to prisoners is one thing and freedom from restraint and license of tongue is another
here at the stern the boat is somewhat heavily freighted
your lordship will oblige me if you will go forward where there is room enough and to spare  his black brows drew together
and what if i refuse sir he demanded haughtily
i have rope here i answered and to aid me the gentleman who once before tonight and in despite of your struggles lifted you in his arms like an infant
we will tie you hand and foot and lay you in the bottom of the boat
if you make too much trouble there is always the river
my lord you are not now at whitehall
you are with desperate men outlaws who have no king and so fear no king's minions
will you go free or will you go bound
go you shall one way or the other  he looked at me with rage and hatred in his face
then with a laugh that was not good to hear and a shrug of the shoulders he went forward to bear diccon company in the bow
chapter xx in which we are in desperate case   god walketh upon the sea as he walketh upon the land said the minister
the sea is his and we are his
he will do what it liketh him with his own as he spoke he looked with a steadfast soul into the black hollow of the wave that combed above us threatening destruction
the wave broke and the boat still lived
borne high upon the shoulder of the next rolling hill we looked north south east and west and saw only a waste of livid ever forming ever breaking waves a gray sky streaked with darker gray shifting vapor and a horizon impenetrably veiled
where we were in the great bay in what direction we were being driven how near we might be to the open sea or to some fatal shore we knew not
what we did know was that both masts were gone that we must bail the boat without ceasing if we would keep it from swamping that the wind was doing an apparently impossible thing and rising higher and higher and that the waves which buffeted us from one to the other were hourly swelling to a more monstrous bulk
we had come into the wider waters at dawn and still under canvas
an hour later off point comfort a bare mast contented us we had hardly gotten the sail in when mast and all went overboard
that had been hours ago
a common peril is a mighty leveler of barriers
scant time was there in that boat to make distinction between friend and foe
as one man we fought the element which would devour us
each took his turn at the bailing each watched for the next great wave before which we must cower clinging with numbed hands to gunwale and thwart
we fared alike toiled alike and suffered alike only that the minister and i cared for mistress percy asking no help from the others
the king's ward endured all without a murmur
she was cold she was worn with watching and terror she was wounded each moment death raised his arm to strike but she sat there dauntless and looked him in the face with a smile upon her own
if wearied out we had given up the fight her look would have spurred us on to wrestle with our fate to the last gasp
she sat between sparrow and me and as best we might we shielded her from the drenching seas and the icy wind
morning had shown me the blood upon her sleeve and i had cut away the cloth from the white arm and had washed the wound with wine and bound it up
if for my fee i should have liked to press my lips upon the blueveined marble still i did it not
when a week before i had stored the boat with food and drink and had brought it to that lonely wharf i had thought that if at the last my wife willed to flee i would attempt to reach the bay and passing out between the capes would go to the north
given an open boat and the tempestuous seas of november there might be one chance out of a hundred of our reaching manhattan and the dutch who might or might not give us refuge
she had willed to flee and we were upon our journey and the one chance had vanished
that wan monotonous cold and clinging mist had shrouded us for our burial and our grave yawned beneath us
the day passed and the night came and still we fought the sea and still the wind drove us whither it would
the night passed and the second morning came and found us yet alive
my wife lay now at my feet her head pillowed upon the bundle she had brought from the minister's house
too weak for speech waiting in pain and cold and terror for death to bring her warmth and life the knightly spirit yet lived in her eyes and she smiled when i bent over her with wine to moisten her lips
at length she began to wander in her mind and to speak of summer days and flowers
a hand held my heart in a slowly tightening grip of iron and the tears ran down the minister's cheeks
the man who had darkened her young life bringing her to this looked at her with an ashen face
as the day wore on the gray of the sky paled to a dead man's hue and the wind lessened but the waves were still mountain high
one moment we poised like the gulls that now screamed about us upon some giddy summit the sky alone above and around us the next we sank into dark green and glassy caverns
suddenly the wind fell away veered and rose again like a giant refreshed
diccon started put his hand to his ear then sprang to his feet
breakers he cried hoarsely
we listened with straining ears
he was right
the low ominous murmur changed to a distant roar grew louder yet and yet louder and was no longer distant
it will be the sand islets off cape charles sir he said
i nodded
he and i knew there was no need of words
the sky grew paler and paler and soon upon the woof of the clouds a splash of dull yellow showed where the sun would be
the fog rose laying bare the desolate ocean
before us were two very small islands mere handfuls of sand lying side by side and encompassed half by the open sea half by stiller waters diked in by marshes and sand bars
a coarse scanty grass and a few stunted trees with branches bending away from the sea lived upon them but nothing else
over them and over the marshes and the sand banks circled myriads of great white gulls
their harsh unearthly voices came to us faintly and increased the desolation of earth and sky and sea
to the shellstrewn beach of the outer of the two islets raced long lines of surf and between us and it lurked a sand bar against which the great rollers dashed with a bulllike roar
the wind drove us straight upon this bar
a moment of deadly peril and it had us fast holding us for the waves to beat our life out
the boat listed then rested quivering through all its length
the waves pounded against its side each watery batteringram dissolving in foam and spray but to give place to another and yet it held together and yet we lived
how long it would hold we could not tell we only knew it could not be for long
the inclination of the boat was not so great but that with caution we might move about
there were on board rope and an axe
with the latter i cut away the thwarts and the decking in the bow and diccon and i made a small raft
when it was finished i lifted my wife in my arms and laid her upon it and lashed her to it with the rope
she smiled like a child then closed her eyes
i have gathered primroses until i am tired she said
i will sleep here a little in the sunshine and when i awake i will make you a cowslip ball  time passed and the groaning trembling timbers still held together
the wind fell the sky became blue and the sun shone
another while and the waves were less mountainous and beat less furiously against the boat
hope brightened before us
to strong swimmers the distance to the islet was trifling if the boat would but last until the sea subsided we might gain the beach
what we would do upon that barren spot where was neither man nor brute food nor water was a thing that we had not the time to consider
it was land that we craved
another hour and the sea still fell
another and a wave struck the boat with force
the sea is coming in cried the minister
ay i answered
she will go to pieces now  the minister rose to his feet
i am no mariner he said but once in the water i can swim you like any fish
there have been times when i have reproached the lord for that he cased a poor silly humble preacher like me with the strength and seeming of some might man of old and there have been times when i have thanked him for that strength
i thank him now
captain percy if you will trust the lady to me i will take her safely to that shore  i raised my head from the figure over which i was bending and looked first at the still tumultuous sea and then at the gigantic frame of the minister
when we had made that frail raft no swimmer could have lived in that shock of waves now there was a chance for all and for the minister with his great strength the greatest i have ever seen in any man a double chance
i took her from the raft and gave her into his arms
a minute later the boat went to pieces
side by side sparrow and i buffeted the sea
he held the king's ward in one arm and he bore her safely over the huge swells and through the onslaught of the breaking waves
i could thank god for his strength and trust her to it
for the other three of us we were all strong swimmers and though bruised and beat about we held our own
each wave overcome left us nearer the isleta little while and our feet touched bottom
a short struggle with the tremendous surf and we were out of the maw of the sea but out upon a desolate islet a mere hand'sbreadth of sand and shell in a lonely ocean some three leagues from the mainland of accomac and upon it neither food nor water
we had the clothes upon our backs and my lord and i had kept our swords
i had a knife and diccon too was probably armed
the flint and steel and tinder box within my pouch made up our store
the minister laid the woman whom he carried upon the pebbles fell upon his knees and lifted his rugged face to heaven
i too knelt and with my hand upon her heart said my own prayer in my own way
my lord stood with unbent head his eyes upon that still white face but diccon turned abruptly and strode off to a low ridge of sand from the top of which one might survey the entire island
in two minutes he was back again
there's plenty of driftwood further up the beach he announced and a mort of dried seaweed
at least we need n't freeze  the great bonfire that we made roared and crackled sending out a most cheerful heat and light
under that genial breath the color came slowly back to madam's cheek and lip and her heart beat more strongly
presently she turned under my hand and with a sigh pillowed her head upon her arm and went to sleep in that blessed warmth like a little child
we who had no mind for sleep sat there beside the fire and watched the sun sink behind the low black line of the mainland now plainly visible in the cleared air
it dyed the waves blood red and shot out one long ray to crimson a single floating cloud no larger than a man's hand high in the blue
sea birds a countless multitude went to and fro with harsh cries from island to marsh and marsh to island
the marshes were still green they lay a half moon of fantastic shapes each parted from the other by pink water
beyond them was the inlet dividing us from the mainland and that inlet was three leagues in width
we turned and looked seaward
naught but leaping waves whitecapped to the horizon
we touched here the time we went against the french at port royal and st croix i said
we had heard a rumor that the bermuda pirates had hidden gold here
argall and i went over every foot of it  and found no water questioned the minister
and found no water  the light died from the west and from the sea beneath and the night fell
when with the darkness the sea fowl ceased their clamor a dreadful silence suddenly enfolded us
the rush of the surf made no difference the ear heard it but to the mind there was no sound
the sky was thick with stars every moment one shot and the trail of white fire it left behind melted into the night silently like snowflakes
there was no wind
the moon rose out of the sea and lent the sandy isle her own pallor
here and there back amongst the dunes the branches of a low and leafless tree writhed upward like dark fingers thrust from out the spectral earth
the ocean quiet now dreamed beneath the moon and cared not for the five lives it had cast upon that span of sand
we piled driftwood and tangles of seaweed upon our fire and it flamed and roared and broke the silence
diccon going to the landward side of the islet found some oysters which we roasted and ate but we had nor wine nor water with which to wash them down
at least there are here no foes to fear quoth my lord
we may all sleep tonight and zooks
we shall need it he spoke frankly with an open face
i will take one watch if you will take the other i said to the minister
he nodded
i will watch until midnight  it was long past that time when he roused me from where i lay at mistress percy's feet
i should have relieved you long ago i told him
he smiled
the moon now high in the heavens shone upon and softened his rugged features
i thought i had never seen a face so filled with tenderness and hope and a sort of patient power
i have been with god  he said simply
the starry skies and the great ocean and the little shells beneath my handhow wonderful are thy works o lord
what is man that thou art mindful of him
and yet not a sparrow fallethi rose and sat by the fire and he laid himself down upon the sand beside me
master sparrow i asked have you ever suffered thirst  no he answered
we spoke in low tones lest we should wake her
diccon and my lord upon the other side of the fire were sleeping heavily
i have i said
once i lay upon a field of battle throughout a summer day sore wounded and with my dead horse across my body
i shall forget the horror of that lost field and the torment of that weight before i forget the thirst  you think there is no hope  what hope should there be  he was silent
presently he turned and looked at the king's ward where she lay in the rosy light then his eyes came back to mine
if it comes to the worst i shall put her out of her torment i said
he bowed his head and we sat in silence our gaze upon the ground between us listening to the low thunder of the surf and the crackling of the fire
i love her i said at last
god help me  he put his finger to his lips
she had stirred and opened her eyes
i knelt beside her and asked her how she did and if she wanted aught
it is warm she said wonderingly
you are no longer in the boat i told her
you are safe upon the land
you have been sleeping here by the fire that we kindled  an exquisite smile just lit her face and her eyelids drooped again
i am so tired she said drowsily that i will sleep a little longer
will you bring me some water captain percy
i am very thirsty  after a moment i said gently i will go get it madam she made no answer she was already asleep
nor did sparrow and i speak again
he laid himself down with his face to the ocean and i sat with my head in my hands and thought and thought to no purpose
chapter xxi in which a grave is digged   when the stars had gone out and the moon begun to pale i raised my face from my hands
only a few glowing embers remained of the fire and the driftwood that we had collected was exhausted
i thought that i would gather more and build up the fire against the time when the others should awake
the driftwood lay in greatest quantity some distance up the beach against a low ridge of sand dunes
beyond these the islet tapered off to a long gray point of sand and shell
walking toward this point in the first pale light of dawn i chanced to raise my eyes and beheld riding at anchor beyond the spit of sand a ship
i stopped short and rubbed my eyes
she lay there on the sleeping ocean like a dream ship her masts and rigging black against the pallid sky the mist that rested upon the sea enfolding half her hull
she might have been of three hundred tons burthen she was black and twodecked and very high at poop and forecastle and she was heavily armed
my eyes traveled from the ship to the shore and there dragged up on the point the oars within it was a boat
at the head of the beach beyond the line of shell and weed the sand lay piled in heaps
with these friendly hillocks between me and the sea i crept on as silently as i might until i reached a point just above the boat
here i first heard voices
i went a little further then knelt and parting the long coarse grass that filled the hollow between two hillocks looked out upon two men who were digging a grave
they dug in a furious hurry throwing the sand to left and right and cursing as they dug
they were powerful men of a most villainous cast of countenance and dressed very oddly
one with a shirt of coarsest dowlas and a filthy rag tying up a broken head yet wore velvet breeches and wiped the sweat from his face with a wrought handkerchief the other topped a suit of shreds and patches with a fine bushy ruff and swung from one ragged shoulder a cloak of grogram lined with taffeta
on the ground to one side of them lay something long and wrapped in white
as they dug and cursed the light strengthened
the east changed from gray to pale rose from rose to a splendid crimson shot with gold
the mist lifted and the sea burned red
two boats were lowered from the ship and came swiftly toward the point
here they are at last growled the gravedigger with the broken head and velvet breeches
they've taken their time snarled his companion and us two here on this dd island with a dead man the whole ghost's hour
boarding a ship's nothing but to dig a grave on the land before cockcrow with the man you're to put in it looking at you
why could n't he be buried at sea decent and respectable like other folk  it was his willthat's all i know said the first just as it was his will when he found he was a dying man to come booming away from the gold seas up here to a land where there is n't no gold and never will be
belike he thought he'd find waiting for him at the bottom of the sea all along from the lucayas to cartagena the many he sent there afore he died
and captain paradise he says says he 'it's ill crossing a dead man
we'll obey him this once more'  captain paradise cried he of the ruff
who made him captaincurse him  his fellow straightened himself with a jerk
who made him captain
the ship will make him captain
who else should be captain  red gil  red gil exclaimed the other
i'd rather have the spaniard  the spaniard would do well enough if the rest of us were n't english
if hating every other spaniard would do it he'd be english fast enough  the scoundrel with the broken head burst into a loud laugh
d' ye remember the bark we took off porto bello with the priests aboard
oho
oho  the rogue with the ruff grinned
i reckon the padres remember it and find hell easy lying
this hole's deep enough i'm thinking  they both clambered out and one squatted at the head of the grave and mopped his face with his delicate handkerchief while the other swung his fine cloak with an air and dug his bare toes in the sand
the two boats now grated upon the beach and several of their occupants springing out dragged them up on the sand
we'll never get another like him that's gone said the worthy at the head of the grave gloomily regarding the something wrapped in white
that's gospel truth assented the other with a prodigious sigh
he was a man what was a man
he never stuck at nothing
don or priest man or woman good red gold or dirty silverit was all one to him
but he's dead and gone  now if we had a captain like kirby suggested the first
kirby keeps to the summer isles said the second
't is n't often now that he swoops down as far as the indies  the man with the broken head laughed
when he does there's a noise in that part of the world  and that's gospel truth too swore the other with an oath of admiration
by this the score or more who had come in the two boats were halfway up the beach
in front side by side as each conceding no inch of leadership walked three men a large man with a villainous face much scarred and a huge bushy dark red beard a tall dark man with a thin fierce face and bloodshot eyes the spaniard by his looks and a slight man with the face and bearing of an english gentleman
the men behind them differed no whit from the two gravediggers being as scoundrelly of face as great of strength and as curiously attired
they came straight to the open grave and the dead man beside it
the three who seemed of most importance disposed themselves still side by side at the head of the grave and their following took the foot
it's a dirty piece of work said red gil in a voice like a raven's and the sooner it's done with and we are aboard again and booming back to the indies the better i'll like it
over with him brave boys  is it yours to give the word asked the slight man who was dressed pointdevice and with a finical nicety in black and silver
his voice was low and clear and of a somewhat melancholy cadence going well with the pensiveness of fine deeply fringed eyes
why should n't i give the word growled the personage addressed adding with an oath i've as good a right to give it as any manmaybe a better right  that would be scanned said he of the pensive eyes
gentlemen we have here the pick of the ship
for the captain that these choose those on board will throw up their caps
let us bury the dead and then let choice be made of one of us three each of whom has claims that might be put forwardhe broke off and picking up a delicate shell began to study its pearly spirals with a tender thoughtful halfpleased halfmelancholy countenance
the gravedigger with the wrought handkerchief looked from him to the rascal crew massed at the foot of the grave and seeing his own sentiments mirrored in the countenances of not a few snatched the bloody clout from his head waved it and cried out paradise  whereupon arose a great confusion
some bawled for paradise some for red gil a few for the spaniard
the two gravediggers locked horns and a brawny devil with a woman's mantle swathed about his naked shoulders drew a knife and made for a partisan of the spaniard who in his turn skillfully interposed between himself and the attack the body of a bawling wellwisher to red gil
the man in black and silver tossed aside the shell rose and entered the lists
with one hand he seized the gravedigger of the ruff and hurled him apart from him of the velvet breeches with the other he presented a dagger with a jeweled haft at the breast of the ruffian with the woman's mantle while in tones that would have befitted astrophel plaining of his love to rocks woods and streams he poured forth a flood of wild singular and filthy oaths such as would have disgraced a camp follower
his interference was effectual
the combatants fell apart and the clamor was stilled whereupon the gentleman of contrarieties at once resumed the gentle and indifferent melancholy of manner and address
let us off with the old love before we are on with the new gentlemen  he said
we'll bury the dead first and choose his successor afterwarddecently and in order i trust and with due submission to the majority  i'll fight for my rights growled red gil
and i for mine cried the spaniard
and each of us'll back his own man muttered in an aside the gravedigger with the broken head
the one they called paradise sighed
it is a thousand pities that there is not amongst us some one of merit so preeminent that faction should hide its head before it
but to the work in hand gentlemen  they gathered closer around the yawning grave and some began to lift the corpse
as for me i withdrew as noiselessly as an indian from my lair of grass and hidden by the heapedup sand made off across the point and down the beach to where a light curl of smoke showed that some one was mending the fire i had neglected
it was sparrow who alternately threw on driftwood and seaweed and spoke to madam who sat at his feet in the blended warmth of fire and sunshine
diccon was roasting the remainder of the oysters he had gathered the night before and my lord stood and stared with a frowning face at the ninemile distant mainland
all turned their eyes upon me as i came up to the fire
a little longer captain percy and we would have had out a search warrant began the minister cheerfully
have you been building a bridge  if i build one i said it will be a perilous one enough
have you looked seaward  we waked but a minute agone he answered
as he spoke he straightened his great form and lifted his face from the fire to the blue sea
diccon still on his knees at his task looked too and my lord turning from his contemplation of the distant kingdom of accomac and mistress percy one hand shading her eyes the slender fingers of the other still immeshed in her long dark hair which she had been braiding
they stared at the ship in silence until my lord laughed
conjure us on board at once captain he cried
we are thirsty  i drew the minister aside
i am going up the beach beyond that point again you will one and all stay here
if i do not come back do the best you can and sell her life as dearly as you can
if i come backyou are quick of wit and have been a player look that you take the cue i give you  i returned to the fire and he followed me amazement in his face
my lord carnal i said i must ask you for your sword  he started and his black brows drew together
though the fortunes of war have made me in some sort your captive sir he said at last and not without dignity i do not see upon this isle to which we are all prisoners the need of so strong testimony to the abjectness of my condition nor deem it generous  we will speak of generosity another day my lord i interrupted
at present i am in a hurry
that you are my prisoner in verity is enough for me but not for others
i must have you so in seeming as well as in truth
moreover master sparrow is weaponless and i must needs disarm an enemy to arm a friend
i beg that you will give what else we must take  he looked at diccon but diccon stood with his face to the sea
i thought we were to have a struggle and i was sorry for it but my lord could and did add discretion to a valor that i never doubted
he shrugged his shoulders burst into a laugh and turned to mistress percy
what can one do lady when one is doubly a prisoner prisoner to numbers and to beauty
e'en laugh at fate and make the best of a bad job
here sir
some day it shall be the point  he drew his rapier from its sheath and presented the hilt to me
i took it with a bow and handed it to sparrow
the king's ward had risen and now leant against the bank of sand her long dark hair half braided drawn over either shoulder her face marble white between the waves of darkness
i do not know that i shall ever come back i said stopping before her
may i kiss your hand before i go  her lips moved but she did not speak
i knelt and kissed her clasped hands
they were cold to my lips
where are you going she whispered
into what danger are you going
iitake me with you  i rose with a laugh at my own folly that could have rested brow and lips on those hands and let the world wag
another time i said
rest in the sunshine now and think that all is well
all will be well i trust  a few minutes later saw me almost upon the party gathered about the grave
the grave had received that which it was to hold until the crack of doom and was now being rapidly filled with sand
the crew of deepdyed villains worked or stood or sat in silence but all looked at the grave and saw me not
as the last handful of sand made it level with the beach i walked into their midst and found myself face to face with the three candidates for the now vacant captaincy
give you goodday gentlemen i cried
is it your captain that you bury or one of your crew or is it only pezos and pieces of eight   chapter xxii in which i change my name and occupation    the sun shining on so much bare steel hurts my eyes i said
put up gentlemen put up
cannot one rover attend the funeral of another without all this crowding and display of cutlery
if you will take the trouble to look around you you will see that i have brought to the obsequies only myself  one by one cutlass and sword were lowered and those who had drawn them falling somewhat back spat and swore and laughed
the man in black and silver only smiled gently and sadly
did you drop from the blue he asked
or did you come up from the sea  i came out of it i said
my ship went down in the storm yesterday
your little cockboat yonder was more fortunate i waved my hand toward that ship of three hundred tons then twirled my mustaches and stood at gaze
was your ship so large then demanded paradise while a murmur of admiration larded with oaths ran around the circle
she was a very great galleon i replied with a sigh for the good ship that was gone
a moment's silence during which they all looked at me
a galleon  then said paradise softly
they that sailed her yesterday are today at the bottom of the sea i continued
alackaday
so are one hundred thousand pezos of gold three thousand bars of silver ten frails of pearls jewels uncounted cloth of gold and cloth of silver
she was a very rich prize  the circle sucked in their breath
all at the bottom of the sea  queried red gil with gloating eyes fixed upon the smiling water
not one pezo left not one little little pearl  i shook my head and heaved a prodigious sigh
the treasure is gone  i said and the men with whom i took it are gone
i am a captain with neither ship nor crew
i take you my friends for a ship and crew without a captain
the inference is obvious  the ring gaped with wonder then strange oaths arose
red gil broke into a bellow of angry laughter while the spaniard glared like a catamount about to spring
so you would be our captain said paradise picking up another shell and poising it upon a hand as fine and small as a woman's
faith you might go farther and fare worse i answered and began to hum a tune
when i had finished it i am kirby i said and waited to see if that shot should go wide or through the hull
for two minutes the dash of the surf and the cries of the wheeling sea fowl made the only sound in that part of the world then from those halfclad rapscallions arose a shout of kirbya shout in which the three leaders did not join
that one who looked a gentleman rose from the sand and made me a low bow
well met noble captain he cried in those his honey tones
you will doubtless remember me who was with you that time at maracaibo when you sunk the galleasses
five years have passed since then and yet i see you ten years younger and three inches taller  i touched once at the lucayas and found the spring de leon sought  i said
sure the waters have a marvelous effect and if they give not eternal youth at least renew that which we have lost  truly a potent aqua vitae he remarked still with thoughtful melancholy
i see that it hath changed your eyes from black to gray  it hath that peculiar virtue i said that it can make black seem white  the man with the woman's mantle drawn about him now thrust himself from the rear to the front rank
that's not kirby he bawled
he's no more kirby than i am kirby
did n't i sail with kirby from the summer isles to cartagena and back again
he's a cheat and i am agoing to cut his heart out he was making at me with a long knife when i whipped out my rapier
am i not kirby you dog i cried and ran him through the shoulder
he dropped and his fellows surged forward with a yell
yet a little patience my masters said paradise in a raised voice and with genuine amusement in his eyes
it is true that that kirby with whom i and our friend there on the ground sailed was somewhat short and as swart as a raven besides having a cut across his face that had taken away a part of his lip and the top of his ear and that this gentleman who announces himself as kirby hath none of kirby's marks
but we are fair and generous and open to conviction  he'll have to convince my cutlass roared red gil
i turned upon him
if i do convince it what then i demanded
if i convince your sword you of spain and yours sir black and silver  the spaniard stared
i was the best sword in lima he said stiffly
i and my toledo will not change our minds  let him try to convince paradise he's got no reputation as a swordsman cried out the gravedigger with the broken head
a roar of laughter followed this suggestion and i gathered from it and from the oaths and allusions to this or that time and place that paradise was not without reputation
i turned to him
if i fight you three one by one and win am i kirby  he regarded the shell with which he was toying with a thoughtful smile held it up that the light might strike through its rose and pearl then crushed it to dust between his fingers
ay he said with an oath
if you win against the cutlass of red gil the best blade of lima and the sword of paradise you may call yourself the devil an you please and we will all subscribe to it  i lifted my hand
i am to have fair play  as one man that crew of desperate villains swore that the odds should be only three to one
by this the whole matter had presented itself to them as an entertainment more diverting than bullfight or bearbaiting
they that follow the sea whether honest men or blackhearted knaves have in their composition a certain childlikeness that makes them easily turned easily led and easily pleased
the wind of their passion shifts quickly from point to point one moment blowing a hurricane the next sinking to a happygolucky summer breeze
i have seen a little thing convert a crew on the point of mutiny into a set of rollicking goodnatured souls whountil the wind veered againwould not hurt a fly
so with these
they spread themselves into a circle squatting or kneeling or standing upon the white sand in the bright sunshine their sinewy hands that should have been ingrained red clasped over their knees or arms akimbo resting upon their hips on their scoundrel faces a broad smile and in their eyes that had looked on nameless horrors a pleasurable expectation as of spectators in a playhouse awaiting the entrance of the players
there is really no good reason why we should gratify your whim said paradise still amused
but it will serve to pass the time
we will fight you one by one  and if i win  he laughed
then on the honor of a gentleman you are kirby and our captain
if you lose we will leave you where you stand for the gulls to bury  a bargain i said and drew my sword
i first roared red gil
god's wounds
there will need no second  as he spoke he swung his cutlass and made an arc of blue flame
the weapon became in his hands a flail terrible to look upon making lightnings and whistling in the air but in reality not so deadly as it seemed
the fury of his onslaught would have beaten down the guard of any mere swordsman but that i was not
a man knowing his weakness and insufficiency in many and many a thing may yet know his strength in one or two and his modesty take no hurt
i was ever master of my sword and it did the thing i would have it do
moreover as i fought i saw her as i had last seen her standing against the bank of sand her dark hair half braided drawn over her bosom and hanging to her knees
her eyes haunted me and my lips yet felt the touch of her hand
i fought wellhow well the lapsing of oaths and laughter into breathless silence bore witness
the ruffian against whom i was pitted began to draw his breath in gasps
he was a scoundrel not fit to die less fit to live unworthy of a gentleman's steel
i presently ran him through with as little compunction and as great a desire to be quit of a dirty job as if he had been a mad dog
he fell and a little later while i was engaged with the spaniard his soul went to that hell which had long gaped for it
to those his companions his death was as slight a thing as would theirs have been to him
in the eyes of the two remaining wouldbe leaders he was a stumblingblock removed and to the squatting openmouthed commonality his taking off weighed not a feather against the solid entertainment i was affording them
i was now a better man than red gilthat was all
the spaniard was a more formidable antagonist
the best blade of lima was by no means to be despised but lima is a small place and its blades can be numbered
the sword that for three years had been counted the best in all the low countries was its better
but i fought fasting and for the second time that morning so maybe the odds were not so great
i wounded him slightly and presently succeeded in disarming him
am i kirby i demanded with my point at his breast
kirby of course senor he answered with a sour smile his eyes upon the gleaming blade
i lowered my point and we bowed to each other after which he sat down upon the sand and applied himself to stanching the bleeding from his wound
the pirate ring gave him no attention but stared at me instead
i was now a better man than the spaniard
the man in black and silver rose and removed his doublet folding it very carefully inside out that the sand might not injure the velvet then drew his rapier looked at it lovingly made it bend until point and hilt wellnigh met and faced me with a bow
you have fought twice and must be weary he said
will you not take breath before we engage or will your long rest afterward suffice you  i will rest aboard my ship i made reply
and as i am in a hurry to be gone we won't delay  our blades had no sooner crossed than i knew that in this last encounter i should need every whit of my skill all my wit audacity and strength
i had met my equal and he came to it fresh and i jaded
i clenched my teeth and prayed with all my heart i set her face before me and thought if i should fail her to what ghastly fate she might come and i fought as i had never fought before
the sound of the surf became a roar in my ears the sunshine an intolerable blaze of light the blue above and around seemed suddenly beneath my feet as well
we were fighting high in the air and had fought thus for ages
i knew that he made no thrust i did not parry no feint i could not interpret
i knew that my eye was more quick to see my brain to conceive and my hand to execute than ever before but it was as though i held that knowledge of some other and i myself was far away at weyanoke in the minister's garden in the haunted wood anywhere save on that barren islet
i heard him swear under his breath and in the face i had set before me the eyes brightened
as if she had loved me i fought for her with all my powers of body and mind
he swore again and my heart laughed within me
the sea now roared less loudly and i felt the good earth beneath my feet
slowly but surely i wore him out
his breath came short the sweat stood upon his forehead and still i deferred my attack
he made the thrust of a boy of fifteen and i smiled as i put it by
why don't you end it he breathed
finish and be dd to you  for answer i sent his sword flying over the nearest hillock of sand
am i kirby i said
he fell back against the heapedup sand and leaned there panting with his hand to his side
kirby or devil he replied
have it your own way  i turned to the now highly excited rabble
shove the boats off half a dozen of you i ordered
some of you others take up that carrion there and throw it into the sea
the gold upon it is for your pains
you there with the wounded shoulder you have no great hurt
i'll salve it with ten pieces of eight from the captain's own share the next prize we take  a shout of acclamation arose that scared the sea fowl
they who so short a time before had been ready to tear me limb from limb now with the greatest apparent delight hailed me as captain
how soon they might revert to their former mood was a question that i found not worth while to propound to myself
by this the man in black and silver had recovered his breath and his equanimity
have you no commission with which to honor me noble captain he asked in gently reproachful tones
have you forgot how often you were wont to employ me in those sweet days when your eyes were black  by no means master paradise i said courteously
i desire your company and that of the gentleman from lima
you will go with me to bring up the rest of my party
the three gentlemen of the broken head the bushy ruff which i protest is vastly becoming and the wounded shoulder will escort us  the rest of your party said paradise softly
ay i answered nonchalantly
they are down the beach and around the point warming themselves by a fire which this piledup sand hides from you
despite the sunshine it is a biting air
let us be going
this island wearies me and i am anxious to be on board ship and away  so small an escort scarce befits so great a captain he said
we will all attend you one and all started forward
i called to mind and gave utterance to all the oaths i had heard in the wars
i entertain you for my subordinate whom i command and not who commands me i cried when my memory failed me
as for you you dogs who would question your captain and his doings stay where you are if you would not be lessoned in earnest  sheer audacity is at times the surest steed a man can bestride
now at least it did me good service
with oaths and grunts of admiration the pirates stayed where they were and went about their business of launching the boats and stripping the body of red gil while the man in black and silver the spaniard the two gravediggers the knave with the wounded shoulder and myself walked briskly up the beach
with these five at my heels i strode up to the dying fire and to those who had sprung to their feet at our approach
sparrow i said easily luck being with us as usual i have fallen in with a party of rovers
i have told them who i amthat kirby to wit whom an injurious world calls the blackest pirate unhangedand have recounted to them how the great galleon which i took some months ago went down yesterday with all on board you and i with these others being the sole survivors
by dint of a little persuasion they have elected me their captain and we will go on board directly and set sail for the indies a hunting ground which we never should have left
you need not look so blank you shall be my mate and right hand still i turned to the five who formed my escort
this gentlemen is my mate jeremy sparrow by name who hath a taste for divinity that in no wise interferes with his taste for a galleon or a guarda costa
this man diccon demon by name was of my crew
the gentleman without a sword is my prisoner taken by me from the last ship i sunk
how he an englishman came to be upon a spanish bark i have not found leisure to inquire
the lady is my prisoner also  sure by rights she should be gaoler and hold all men's hearts in ward  said paradise with a low bow to my unfortunate captive
while he spoke a most remarkable transformation was going on
the minister's grave rugged and deeply lined face smoothed itself and shed ten years at least in the eyes that i had seen wet with noble tears a laughing devil now lurked while his strong mouth became a looselipped devilmaycare one
his head with its aureole of bushy grizzled hair set itself jauntily upon one side and from it and from his face and his whole great frame breathed a wicked jollity quite indescribable
odsbodikins captain he cried
kirby's luck't will pass into a saw
adzooks
and so you're captain once more and i'm mate once more and we've a ship once more and we're off once more       sail the spanish main       give the spaniard pain       ho bully boy heave ho
by 'r lakin
i'm too dry to sing
it will take all the wine of xeres in the next galleon to unparch my tongue    chapter xxiii in which we write upon the sand   day after day the wind filled our sails and sang in the rigging and day after day we sailed through blue seas toward the magic of the south
day after day a listless and voluptuous world seemed too idle for any dream of wrong and day after day we whom a strange turn of fortune's wheel had placed upon a pirate ship held our lives in our hands and walked so close with death that at length that very intimacy did breed contempt
it was not a time to think it was a time to act to laugh and make others laugh to bluster and brag to estrange sword and scabbard to play one's hand with a fine unconcern but all the time to watch watch watch day in and day out every minute of every hour
that ship became a stage and we the actors should have been applauded to the echo
how well we played let witness the fact that the ship came to the indies with me for captain and the minister for mate and with the woman that was on board unharmed nay reverenced like a queen
the great cabin was hers and the poop deck we made for her a fantastic state with doffing of hats and bowings and backward steps
we were her guardthe gentlemen of the queeni and my lord carnal the minister and diccon and we kept between her and the rest of the ship
we did our best and our best was very much
when i think of the songs the minister sang of the roars of laughter that went up from the lounging pirates when sitting astride one of the maindeck guns he made his voice call to them now from the hold now from the stern gallery now from the masthead now from the gilt sea maid upon the prow i laugh too
sometimes a space was cleared for him and he played to them as to the pit at blackfriars
they laughed and wept and swore with delightall save the spaniard who was ever like a thundercloud and paradise who only smiled like some languid sidebox lord
there was wine on board and during the long idle days when the wind droned in the rigging like a bagpipe and there was never a cloud in the sky and the galleons were still far away the pirates gambled and drank
diccon diced with them and taught them all the oaths of a free company
so much wine and no more should they have when they frowned i let them see that their frowning and their halfdrawn knives mattered no doit to me
it was their whima huge jest of which they could never have enoughstill to make believe that they sailed under kirby
lest it should spoil the jest and while the jest outranked all other entertainment they obeyed as though i had been indeed that fierce sea wolf
time passed though it passed like a tortoise and we came to the lucayas to the outposts of the vast hunting ground of spaniard and pirate and buccaneer the fringe of that zone of beauty and villainy and fear and sailed slowly past the islands looking for our prey
the sea was blue as blue could be
only in the morning and the evening it glowed blood red or spread upon its still bosom all the gold of all the indies or became an endless mead of palest green shot with amethyst
when night fell it mirrored the stars great and small or was caught in a net of gold flung across it from horizon to horizon
the ship rent the net with a wake of white fire
the air was balm the islands were enchanted places abandoned by spaniard and indian overgrown serpenthaunted
the reef the still water pink or gold the gleaming beach the green plume of the palm the scarlet birds the cataracts of bloomthe senses swooned with the color the steaming incense the warmth the wonder of that fantastic world
sometimes in the crystal waters near the land we sailed over the gardens of the sea gods and looking down saw red and purple blooms and shadowy waving forests with rainbow fish for humming birds
once we saw below us a sunken ship
with how much gold she had endowed the wealthy sea how many long drowned would rise from her rotted decks when the waves gave up their dead no man could tell
away from the ship darted manyhued fish golddisked or barred and spotted with crimson or silver and purple
the dolphin and the tunny and the flying fish swam with us
sometimes flights of small birds came to us from the land
sometimes the sea was thickly set with fullblown pale red bloom the jellyfish that was a flower to the sight and a nettle to the touch
if a storm arose a fury that raged and threatened it presently swept away and the blue laughed again
when the sun sank there arose in the east such a moon as might have been sole light to all the realms of faery
a beauty languorous and seductive was most absolute empress of the wonderful land and the wonderful sea
we were in the hunting grounds and men went not there to gather flowers
day after day we watched for spanish sails for the plate fleets went that way and some galleass or caravel or galleon might stray aside
at last in the clear green bay of a nameless island at which we stopped for water we found two carracks come upon the same errand took them and with them some slight treasure in rich cloths and gems
a week later in a strait between two islands like tinted clouds we fought a very great galleon from sunrise to noon pierced her hull through and through and silenced her ordnance then boarded her and found a king's ransom in gold and silver
when the fighting had ceased and the treasure was ours then we four stood side by side on the deck of the slowly sinking galleon in front of our prisonersof the men who had fought well of the ashen priests and the trembling women
those whom we faced were in high good humor they had gold with which to gamble and wine to drink and rich clothing with which to prank their villainous bodies and prisoners with whom to make merry
when i ordered the spaniards to lower their boats and taking with them their priests and women row off to one of those two islands the weather changed
we outlived that storm but how i scarcely know
as kirby would have done so did i rating my crew like hounds turning my point this way and that daring them to come taste the red death upon it braving it out like some devil who knows he is invulnerable
my lord swinging the cutlass with which he was armed stood beside me knee to knee and diccon cursed after me making quarterstaff play with his long pike
but it was the minister that won us through
at length they laughed and paradise standing forward swore that such a captain and such a mate were worth the lives of a thousand spaniards
to pleasure kirby they would depart this once from their ancient usage and let the prisoners go though it was passing strangeit being kirby's wont to clap prisoners under hatches and fire their ship above them
at the end of which speech the spaniard began to rave and sprang at me like a catamount
paradise put forth a foot and tripped him up whereat the pirates laughed again and held him back when he would have come at me a second time
from the deck of the shattered galleon i watched her boats with their heavy freight of cowering humanity pull off toward the island
back upon my own poop the grappling irons cast loose and a swiftly widening ribbon of blue between us and the sinking ship i looked at the pirates thronging the waist below me and knew that the play was nearly over
how many days weeks hours before the lights would go out i could not tell they might burn until we took or lost another ship the next hour might see that brief tragedy consummated
i turned and going below met sparrow at the foot of the poop ladder
i have sworn at these pirates until my hair stood on end he said ruefully
god forgive me
and i have bent into circles three half pikes in demonstration of the thing that would occur to them if they tempted me overmuch
and i have sung them all the bloody and lascivious songs that ever i knew in my unregenerate days
i have played the bravo and buffoon until they gaped for wonder
i have damned myself to all eternity i fear but there'll be no mutiny this fair day
it may arrive by tomorrow though  likely enough i said
come within
i have eaten nothing since yesterday  i'll speak to diccon first he answered and went on toward the forecastle while i entered the state cabin
here i found mistress percy kneeling beside the bench beneath the stern windows her face buried in her outstretched arms her dark hair shadowing her like a mantle
when i spoke to her she did not answer
with a sudden fear i stooped and touched her clasped hands
a shudder ran through her frame and she slowly raised a colorless face
are you come back she whispered
i thought you would never come back
i thought they had killed you
i was only praying before i killed myself  i took her hands and wrung them apart to rouse her she was so white and cold and spoke so strangely
god forbid that i should die yet awhile madam i said
when i can no longer serve you then i shall not care how soon i die  the eyes with which she gazed upon me were still wide and unseeing
the guns she cried wresting her hands from mine and putting them to her ears
oh the guns
they shake the air
and the screams and the tramplingthe guns again  i brought her wine and made her drink it then sat beside her and told her gently over and over again that there was no longer thunder of the guns or screams or trampling
at last the long tearless sobs ceased and she rose from her knees and let me lead her to the door of her cabin
there she thanked me softly with downcast eyes and lips that yet trembled then vanished from my sight leaving me first to wonder at that terror and emotion in her who seldom showed the thing she felt and finally to conclude that it was not so wonderful after all
we sailed onsouthwards to cuba then north again to the lucayas and the florida straits looking for spanish ships and their gold
the lights yet burnednow brightly now so sunken that it seemed as though the next hour they must flicker out
we the players flagged not in that desperate masque but we knew that in spite of all endeavor the darkness was coming fast upon us
had it been possible we would have escaped from the ship hazarding new fortunes on the spanish main in an open boat sans food or water
but the pirates watched us very closely
they called me captain and kirby and for the jest's sake gave an exaggerated obedience with laughter and flourishes but none the less i was their prisoneri and those i had brought with me to that ship
an islet shaped like the crescent moon rose from out the sea before us
we needed water and so we felt our way between the horns of the crescent into the blue crystal of a fairy harbor
one low hill rosecolored from base to summit with scarce a hint of the green world below that canopy of giant bloom a little silver beach with wonderful shells upon it the sound of a waterfall and a lazy surfwe smelt the fruits and the flowers and a longing for the land came upon us
six men were left on the ship and all besides went ashore
some rolled the water casks toward the sound of the cascade others plunged into the forest to return laden with strange and luscious fruits birds guanas conieswhatever eatable thing they could lay hands upon others scattered along the beach to find turtle eggs or if fortune favored them the turtle itself
they laughed they sang they swore until the isle rang to their merriment
like wanton children they called to each other to the screaming birds to the echoing bloomdraped hill
i spread a square of cloth upon the sand in the shadow of a mighty tree that stood at the edge of the forest and the king's ward took her seat upon it and looked in the golden light of the sinking sun the very spirit of the isle
by this we two were alone on the beach
the hunters for eggs led by diccon were out upon the farthest gleaming horn from the wood came the loud laughter of the fruit gatherers and a most rollicking song issuing from the mighty chest of master jeremy sparrow
with the woodsmen had gone my lord
i walked a little way into the forest and shouted a warning to sparrow against venturing too far
when i returned to the giant tree and the cloth in the shadow of its outer branches my wife was writing on the sand with a pointed shell
she had not seen or heard me and i stood behind her and read what she wrote
it was my name
she wrote it three times slowly and carefully then she felt my presence glanced swiftly up smiled rubbed out my name and wrote sparrow's diccon's and the king's in succession
lest i should forget to make my letters she explained
i sat down at her feet and for some time we said no word
the light falling between the heavy blooms cast bright sequins upon her dress and dark hair
the blooms were not more pink than her cheeks the recesses of the forest behind us not deeper or darker than her eyes
the laughter and the song came faintly to us now
the sun was low in the west and a wonderful light slept upon the sea
last year we had a masque at court she said at length breaking the long silence
we had calypso's island and i was calypso
the island was built of boards covered with green velvet and there was a mound upon it of pink silk roses
there was a deep blue painted sea below and a deep blue painted sky above
my nymphs danced around the mound of roses while i sat upon a real rock beside the painted sea and talked with ulyssesto wit my lord of buckinghamin gold armor
that was a strange bright unreal and wearisome day but not so strange and unreal as this  she ceased to speak and began again to write upon the sand
i watched her white hand moving to and fro
she wrote how long will it last  i do not know
not long  she wrote again if there is time at the last when you see that it is best will you kill me  i took the shell from her hand and wrote my answer beneath her question
the forest behind us sank into that pause and breathless hush between the noises of the day and the noises of the night
the sun dropped lower and the water became as pink as the blooms above us
an you could would you change i asked
would you return to england and safety  she took a handful of the sand and let it slowly drift through her white fingers
you know that i would not she said not if the end were to come tonight
onlyonlyshe turned from me and looked far out to sea
i could not see her face only the dusk of her hair and her heaving bosom
my blood may be upon your hands she said in a whisper but yours will be upon my soul  she turned yet further away and covered her eyes with her hand
i arose and bent over her until i could have touched with my lips that bowed head
jocelyn i said
a branch of yellow fruit fell beside us and my lord carnal a mass of gaudy bloom in his hand stepped from the wood
i returned to lay our firstfruits at madam's feet he explained his darkly watchful eyes upon us both
a gift from one poor prisoner to another madam he dropped the flowers in her lap
will you wear them lady
they are as fair almost as i could wish  she touched the blossoms with listless fingers said they were fair then rising let them drop upon the sand
i wear no flowers save of my husband's gathering my lord she said
there was a pathos and weariness in her voice and a mist of unshed tears in her eyes
she hated him she loved me not yet was forced to turn to me for help at every point and she had stood for weeks upon the brink of death and looked unfalteringly into the gulf beneath her
my lord i said you know in what direction master sparrow led the men
will you reenter the wood and call them to return
the sun is fast sinking and darkness will be upon us  he looked from her to me with his brows drawn downwards and his lips pressed together
stooping he took up the fallen flowers and deliberately tore them to pieces until the pink petals were all scattered upon the sand
i am weary of requests that are but sugared commands he said thickly
go seek your own men an you will
here we are but man to man and i budge not
i stay as the king would have me stay beside the unfortunate lady whom you have made the prisoner and the plaything of a pirate ship  you wear no sword my lord carnal i said at last and so may lie with impunity  but you can get me one he cried with illconcealed eagerness
i laughed
i am not zealous in mine enemy's cause my lord
i shall not deprive master sparrow of your lordship's sword  before i knew what he was about he crossed the yard of sand between us and struck me in the face
will that quicken your zeal he demanded between his teeth
i seized him by the arm and we stood so both white with passion both breathing heavily
at length i flung his arm from me and stepped back
i fight not my prisoner i said nor while the lady you have named abides upon that ship with the nobleman who more than myself is answerable for her being there do i put my life in unnecessary hazard
i will endure the smart as best i may my lord until a more convenient season when i will salve it well  i turned to mistress percy and giving her my hand led her down to the boats for i heard the fruit gatherers breaking through the wood and the hunters for eggs black figures against the crimson sky were hurrying down the beach
before the night had quite fallen we were out of the fairy harbor and when the moon rose the islet looked only a silver sail against the jeweled heavens
chapter xxiv in which we choose the lesser of two evils   the luck that had been ours could not hold when the tide turned it ebbed fast
the weather changed
one hurricane followed upon the stride of another with only a blue day or two between
ofttimes we thought the ship was lost
all hands toiled like galley slaves and as the heavens darkened there darkened also the mood of the pirates
in sight of the great island of cuba we gave chase to a bark
the sun was shining and the sea fairly still when first she fled before us we gained upon her and there was not a mile between us when a cloud blotted out the sun
the next minute our own sails gave us occupation enough
the storm not we was victor over the bark she sank with a shriek from her decks that rang above the roaring wind
two days later we fought a large caravel
with a fortunate shot she brought down our foremast and sailed away from us with small damage of her own
all that day and night the wind blew driving us out of our course and by dawn we were as a shuttlecock between it and the sea
we weathered the gale but when the wind sank there fell on board that black ship a menacing silence
in the state cabin i held a council of war
mistress percy sat beside me her arm upon the table her hand shadowing her eyes my lord opposite never took his gaze from her though he listened gloomily to sparrow's rueful assertion that the brazen game we had been playing was wellnigh over
diccon standing behind him bit his nails and stared at the floor
for myself i care not overmuch ended the minister
i scorn not life but think it at its worst well worth the living yet when my god calls me i will go as to a gala day and triumph
you are a soldier captain percy you and diccon here and know how to die
you too my lord carnal are a brave man though a most wicked one
for us four we can drink the cup bitter though it be with little trembling
but there is one among ushis great voice broke and he sat staring at the table
the king's ward uncovered her eyes
if i be not a man and a soldier master sparrow she said simply yet i am the daughter of many valiant gentlemen
i will die as they died before me
and for me as for you four it will be only deathnaught else she looked at me with a proud smile
naught else i said
my lord started from his seat and strode over to the window where he stood drumming his fingers against the casing
i turned toward him
my lord carnal i said you were overheard last night when you plotted with the spaniard  he recoiled with a gasp and his hand went to his side where it found no sword
i saw his eyes busy here and there through the cabin seeking something which he might convert into a weapon
i am yet captain of this ship i continued
why i do not even though it be my last act of authority have you flung to the sharks i scarcely know  he threw back his head all his bravado returned to him
it is not i that stand in danger he began loftily and i would have you remember sir that you are my enemy and that i owe you no loyalty  i am content to be your enemy i answered
you do not dare to set upon me now he went on with his old insolent boastful smile
let me cry out make a certain signal and they without will be here in a twinkling breaking in the doorthe signal set  i said
the mine laid the match burning
then 't is time that we were gone
when i bid the world goodnight my lord my wife goes with me  his lips moved and his black eyes narrowed but he did not speak
an my cheek did not burn so i said i would be content to let you live live captain in verity of this ship of devils until tired of you the devils cut your throat or until some victorious spaniard hung you at his yardarm live even to crawl back to england by hook or crook to wait hat in hand in the antechamber of his grace of buckingham
as it is i will kill you here and now
i restore you your sword my lord and there lies my challenge  i flung my glove at his feet and sparrow unbuckled the keen blade which he had worn since the day i had asked it of its owner and pushed it to me across the table
the king's ward leaned back in her chair very white but with a proud still face and hands loosely folded in her lap
my lord stood irresolute his lip caught between his teeth his eyes upon the door
cry out my lord i said
you are in danger
cry to your friends without who may come in time
cry out loudly like a soldier and a gentleman  with a furious oath he stooped and caught up the glove at his feet then snatched out of my hand the sword that i offered him
push back the settle you it is in the way he cried to diccon then to me in a voice thick with passion come on sir
here there are no meddling governors this time let death throw down the warder  he throws it said the minister beneath his breath
from without came a trampling and a sudden burst of excited voices
the next instant the door was burst open and a most villainous fieryred face thrust itself inside
a ship bawled the apparition and vanished
the clamor increased voices cried for captain and mate and more pirates appeared at the door swearing out the good news come in search of kirby and giving no choice but to go with them at once
until this interruption is over sir i said sternly bowing to him as i spoke
no longer  be sure sir that to my impatience the time will go heavily he answered as sternly
we reached the poop to find the fog that had lain about us thick and white suddenly lifted and the hot sunshine streaming down upon a rough blue sea
to the larboard a league away lay a low endless coast of sand as dazzling white as the surf that broke upon it and running back to a matted growth of vivid green
that is florida said paradise at my elbow and there are reefs and shoals enough between us
it was kirby's luck that the fog lifted
yonder tall ship hath a less fortunate star  she lay between us and the white beach evidently in shoal and dangerous waters
she too had encountered a hurricane and had not come forth victorious
foremast and forecastle were gone and her bowsprit was broken
she lay heavily her ports but a few inches above the water
though we did not know it then most of her ordnance had been flung overboard to lighten her
crippled as she was with what sail she could set she was beating back to open sea from that dangerous offing
where she went we can follow sang out a voice from the throng in our waist
a dd easy prize
and we'll give no quarter this time there was a grimness in the applause of his fellows that boded little good to some on either ship
lord help all poor souls this day ejaculated the minister in undertones then aloud and more hopefully she hath not the look of a don maybe she's buccaneer  she is an english merchantman said paradise
look at her colors
a company ship probably bound for virginia with a cargo of servants gentlemen out at elbows felons children for apprentices traders french vignerons glasswork italians returning councilors and heads of hundreds with their wives and daughters men servants and maid servants
i made the virginia voyage once myself captain  i did not answer
i too saw the two crosses and i did not doubt that the arms upon the flag beneath were those of the company
the vessel which was of about two hundred tons had mightily the look of the george a ship with which we at jamestown were all familiar
sparrow spoke for me
an english ship he cried out of the simplicity of his heart
then she's safe enough for us
perhaps we might speak her and show her that we are english too
perhapshe looked at me eagerly
perhaps you might be let to go off to her in one of the boats  finished paradise dryly
i think not master sparrow  it's other guess messengers that they'll send muttered diccon
they're uncovering the guns sir  every man of those villains save one was of english birth every man knew that the disabled ship was an english merchantman filled with peaceful folk but the knowledge changed their plans no whit
there was a great hubbub cries and oaths and brutal laughter the noise of the gunners with their guns the clang of cutlass and pike as they were dealt out but not a voice raised against the murder that was to be done
i looked from the doomed ship upon which there was now frantic haste and confusion to the excited throng below me and knew that i had as well cry for mercy to winter wolves
the helmsman behind me had not waited for orders and we were bearing down upon the disabled bark
ahead of us upon our larboard bow was a patch of lighter green and beyond it a slight hurry and foam of the waters
half a dozen voices cried warning to the helmsman
it was he of the woman's mantle whom i had run through the shoulder on the island off cape charles and he had been kirby's pilot from maracaibo to fort caroline
now he answered with a burst of vaunting oaths we're in deep water and there's deep water beyond
i've passed this way before and i'll carry ye safe past that reef were 't hell's gate  the desperadoes who heard him swore applause and thought no more of the reef that lay in wait
long since they had gone through the gates of hell for the sake of the prize beyond
knowing the appeal to be hopeless i yet made it
she is english men i shouted
we will fight the spaniards while they have a flag in the indies but our own people we will not touch  the clamor of shouts and oaths suddenly fell and the wind in the rigging the water at the keel the surf on the shore made themselves heard
in the silence the terror of the fated ship became audible
confused voices came to us and the scream of a woman
on the faces of a very few of the pirates there was a look of momentary doubt and wavering it passed and the most had never worn it
they began to press forward toward the poop cursing and threatening working themselves up into a rage that would not care for my sword the minister's cutlass or diccon's pike
one who called himself a wit cried out something about kirby and his methods and two or three laughed
i find that the role of kirby wearies me i said
i am an english gentleman and i will not fire upon an english ship  as if in answer there came from our forecastle a flame and thunder of guns
the gunners there intent upon their business and now within range of the merchantman had fired the three forecastle culverins
the shot cut her rigging and brought down the flag
the pirates' shout of triumph was echoed by a cry from her decks and the defiant roar of her few remaining guns
i drew my sword
the minister and diccon moved nearer to me and the king's ward still and white and braver than a man stood beside me
from the pirates that we faced came one deep breath like the first sigh of the wind before the blast strikes
suddenly the spaniard pushed himself to the front with his gaunt figure and sable dress he had the seeming of a raven come to croak over the dead
he rested his gloomy eyes upon my lord
the latter very white returned the look then with his head held high crossed the deck with a measured step and took his place among us
he was followed a moment later by paradise
i never thought to die in my bed captain said the latter nonchalantly
sooner or later what does it matter
and you must know that before i was a pirate i was a gentleman turning he doffed his hat with a flourish to those he had quitted
hell litter he cried
i have run with you long enough
now i have a mind to die an honest man  at this defection a dead hush of amazement fell upon that crew
one and all they stared at the man in black and silver moistening their lips but saying no word
we were five armed and desperate men they were fourscore
we might send many to death before us but at the last we ourselves must diewe and those aboard the helpless ship
in the moment's respite i bowed my head and whispered to the king's ward
i had rather it were your sword she answered in a low voice in which there was neither dread nor sorrow
you must not let it grieve you it will be added to your good deeds
and it is i that should ask your forgiveness not you mine  though there was scant time for such dalliance i bent my knee and rested my forehead upon her hand
as i rose the minister's hand touched my shoulder and the voice spoke in my ear
there is another way he said
there is god's death and not man's
look and see what i mean  i followed the pointing of his eyes and saw how close we were to those white and tumbling waters the danger signal the rattle of the hidden snake
the eyes of the pirate at the helm too were upon them his brows were drawn downward his lips pressed together the whole man bent upon the ship's safe passage
the low thunder of the surf the cry of a wheeling sea bird the gleaming lonely shore the cloudless sky the ocean and the white sand far far below where one might sleep well sleep well with other valiant dead long drowned long changed
of their bones are coral made  the storm broke with fury and outcries and a blue radiance of drawn steel
a pistol ball sang past my ear
don't shoot roared the gravedigger to the man who had fired the shot
don't cut them down
take them and thrust them under hatches until we've time to give them a slow death
and hands off the woman until we've time to draw lots  he and the spaniard led the rush
i turned my head and nodded to sparrow then faced them again
then may the lord have mercy upon your souls i said
as i spoke the minister sprang upon the helmsman and striking him to the deck with one blow of his huge fist himself seized the wheel
before the pirates could draw breath he had jammed the helm to starboard and the reef lay right across our bows
a dreadful cry went up from that black ship to a deaf heavena cry that was echoed by a wild shout of triumph from the merchantman
the mass fronting us broke in terror and rage and confusion
some ran frantically up and down with shrieks and curses others sprang overboard
a few made a dash for the poop and for us who stood to meet them
they were led by the spaniard and the gravedigger
the former i met and sent tumbling back into the waist the latter whirled past me and rushing upon paradise thrust him through with a pike then dashed on to the wheel to be met and hewn down by diccon
the ship struck
i put my arm around my wife and my hand before her eyes and while i looked only at her in that storm of terrible cries of flapping canvas rushing water and crashing timbers the spaniard clambered like a catamount upon the poop that was now high above the broken forepart of the ship and fired his pistol at me pointblank
chapter xxv in which my lord hath his day   i and black lamoral were leading a forlorn hope
with all my old company behind us we were thundering upon an enemy as thick as ants covering the face of the earth
down came black lamoral and the hoofs of every mad charger went over me
for a time i was dead then i lived again and was walking with the forester's daughter in the green chase at home
the oaks stretched broad sheltering arms above the young fern and the little wild flowers and the deer turned and looked at us
in the open spaces starring the lush grass were all the yellow primroses that ever bloomed
i gathered them for her but when i would have given them to her she was no longer the forester's daughter but a proud lady heiress to lands and gold the ward of the king
she would not take the primroses from a poor gentleman but shook her head and laughed sweetly and faded into a waterfall that leaped from a pink hill into a waveless sea
another darkness and i was captive to the chickahominies tied to the stake
my arm and shoulder were on fire and opechancanough came and looked at me with his dark still face and his burning eyes
the fierce pain died and i with it and i lay in a grave and listened to the loud and deep murmur of the forest above
i lay there for ages on ages before i awoke to the fact that the darkness about me was the darkness of a ship's hold and the murmur of the forest the wash of the water alongside
i put out an arm and touched not the side of a grave but a ship's timbers
i stretched forth the other arm then dropped it with a groan
some one bent over me and held water to my lips
i drank and my senses came fully to me
diccon i said
it's not diccon replied the figure setting down a pitcher
it is jeremy sparrow
thank god you are yourself again  where are we i asked when i had lain and listened to the water a little longer
in the hold of the george he answered
the ship sank by the bows and wellnigh all were drowned
but when they upon the george saw that there was a woman amongst us who clung to the poop deck they sent their longboat to take us off  the light was too dim for me to read his face so i touched his arm
she was saved he said
she is safe now
there are gentlewomen aboard and she is in their care  i put my unhurt arm across my eyes
you are weak yet said the minister gently
the spaniard's ball you know went through your shoulder and in some way your arm was badly torn from shoulder to wrist
you have been out of your head ever since we were brought here three days ago
the chirurgeon came and dressed your wound and it is healing well
don't try to speaki'll tell you all
diccon has been pressed into service as the ship is short of hands having lost some by fever and some overboard
four of the pirates were picked up and hung at the yardarm next morning  he moved as he spoke and something clanked in the stillness
you are ironed i exclaimed
only my ankles
my lord would have had me bound hand and foot but you were raving for water and taking you for a dying man they were so humane as to leave my hands free to attend you  my lord would have had you bound i said slowly
then it's my lord's day  high noon and blazing sunshine he answered with a rueful laugh
it seems that half the folk on board had gaped at him at court
lord
when he put his foot over the side of the ship how the women screeched and the men stared
he 's cock of the walk now my lord carnal the king's favorite  and we are pirates  that 's the case in a nutshell he answered cheerfully
do they know how the ship came to strike upon that reef i asked
probably not unless madam has enlightened them
i did n't take the troublethey would n't have believed meand i can take my oath my lord has n't
he was only our helpless prisoner you know and they would think madam mistaken or bewitched  it 's not a likely tale i said grimly seeing that we had already opened fire upon them  i trust in heaven the sharks got the men who fired the culverins he cried and then laughed at his own savagery
i lay still and tried to think
who are they on board i asked at last
i don't know he replied
i was only on deck until my lord had had his say in the poop cabin with the master and a gentleman who appeared most in authority
then the pirates were strung up and we were bundled down here in quick order
but there seems to be more of quality than usual aboard  you do not know where we are  we lay at anchor for a daywhilst they patched her up i supposeand since then there has been rough weather
we must be still off florida and that is all i know
now go to sleep
you'll get your strength best so and there's nothing to be gotten by waking  he began to croon a manyversed psalm
i slept and waked and slept again and was waked by the light of a torch against my eyes
the torch was held by a muchbetarred seaman and by its light a gentleman of a very meagre aspect with a weazen face and small black eyes was busily examining my wounded shoulder and arm
it passeth belief he said in a singsong voice how often wounds with naught in the world done for them outside of fair water and a clean rag do turn to and heal out of sheer perversity
now if i had been allowed to treat this one properly with scalding oil and melted lead and to have bled the patient as he should have been bled it is ten to one that by this time there would have been a pirate the less in the world he rose to his feet with a highly injured countenance
then he's doing well asked sparrow
so well that he could n't do better replied the other
the arm was a trifling matter though no doubt exquisitely painful
the wound in the shoulder is miraculously healing without either bloodletting or cauteries
you'll have to hang after all my friend he looked at me with his little beady eyes
it must have been a grand life he said regretfully
i never expected to see a pirate chief in the flesh
when i was a boy i used to dream of the black ships and the gold and the fighting
by the serpent of esculapius in my heart of hearts i would rather be such a world's thief uncaught than governor of virginia he gathered up the tools of his trade and motioned to his torchbearer to go before
i'll have to report you rapidly recovering he said warningly as he turned to follow the light
very well i made answer
to whom am i indebted for so much kindness  i am dr john pott newly appointed physician general to the colony of virginia
it is little of my skill i could give you but that little i gladly bestow upon a real pirate
what a life it must have been
and to have to part with it when you are yet young
and the good red gold and the rich gems all at the bottom of the sea  he sighed heavily and went his way
the hatches were closed after him and the minister and i were left in darkness while the slow hours dragged themselves past us
through the chinks of the hatches a very faint light streamed down and made the darkness gray instead of black
the minister and i saw each other dimly as spectres
some one brought us mouldy biscuit that i wanted not and water for which i thirsted
sparrow put the small pitcher to his lips kept it there a moment then held it to mine
i drank and with that generous draught tasted pure bliss
it was not until five minutes later that i raised myself upon my elbow and turned on him
the pitcher felt full to my lips i exclaimed
did you drink when you said you did  he put out his great hand and pushed me gently down
i have no wound  he said and there was not enough for two  the light that trembled through the cracks above died away and the darkness became gross
the air in the hold was stifling our souls panted for the wind and the stars outside
at the worst when the fetid blackness lay upon our chests like a nightmare the hatch was suddenly lifted a rush of pure air came to us and with it the sound of men's voices speaking on the deck above
said one true the doctor pronounces him out of all danger yet he is a wounded man  he is a desperate and dangerous man broke in another harshly
i know not how you will answer to your company for leaving him unironed so long  i and the company understand each other my lord rejoined the first speaker with some haughtiness
i can keep my prisoner without advice
if i now order irons to be put upon him and his accomplice it is because i see fit to do so and not because of your suggestion my lord
you wish to take this opportunity to have speech with himto that i can have no objection  the speaker moved away
as his footsteps died in the distance my lord laughed and his merriment was echoed by three or four harsh voices
some one struck flint against steel and there was a sudden flare of torches and the steadier light of a lantern
a man with a brutal weatherbeaten facethe master of the ship we guessedcame down the ladder lantern in hand turned when he had reached the foot and held up the lantern to light my lord down
i lay and watched the king's favorite as he descended
the torches held slantingly above cast a fiery light over his stately figure and the face which had raised him from the low estate of a doubtful birth and a most lean purse to a pinnacle too near the sun for men to gaze at with undazzled eyes
in his rich dress and the splendor of his beauty with the red glow enveloping him he lit the darkness like a baleful star
the two torchbearers and a third man descended closing the hatch after them
when all were down my lord the master at his heels came and stood over me
i raised myself though with difficulty for the fever had left me weak as a babe and met his gaze
his was a cruel look if i had expected as assuredly i did not expect mercy or generosity from this my dearest foe his look would have struck such a hope dead
presently he beckoned to the men behind him
put the manacles upon him first he said with a jerk of his thumb toward sparrow
the man who had come down last and who carried irons enough to fetter six pirates started forward to do my lord's bidding
the master glanced at sparrow's great frame and pulled out a pistol
the minister laughed
you'll not need it friend
i know when the odds are too great he held out his arms and the men fettered them wrist to wrist
when they had finished he said calmly 'i have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green bay tree
yet he passed away and lo he was not yea i sought him but he could not be found
'  my lord turned from him and pointed to me
he kept his eyes upon my face while they shackled me hand and foot then said abruptly you have cords there bind his arms to his sides the men wound the cords around me many times
draw them tight commanded my lord
there came a wrathful clank of the minister's chains
the arm is torn and inflamed from shoulder to wrist as i make no doubt you have been told he cried
for very shame man  draw them tighter said my lord between his teeth
the men knotted the cords and rose to their feet to be dismissed by my lord with a curt you may go they drew back to the foot of the ladder while the master of the ship went and perched himself upon one of the rungs
the air is fresher here beneath the hatch he remarked
as for me though i lay at my enemy's feet i could yet set my teeth and look him in the eyes
the cup was bitter but i could drink it with an unmoved face
art paid he demanded
art paid for the tree in the red forest without the haunted wood
art paid thou bridegroom  no i answered
bring her here to laugh at me as she laughed in the twilight beneath the guesthouse window  i thought he would murder me with the poniard he drew but presently he put it up
she is come to her senses he said
up in the state cabin are bright lights and wine and laughter
there are gentlewomen aboard and i have been singing to the lute to themand to her
she is saved from the peril into which you plunged her she knows that the king's court of high commission to say nothing of the hangman will soon snap the fetters which she now shudders to think of that the king and one besides will condone her past short madness
her cheeks are roses her eyes are stars
but now when i pressed her hand between the verses of my song she smiled and sighed and blushed
she is again the dutiful ward of the king the lady jocelyn leighshe hath asked to be so called  you lie i said
she is my true and noble wife
she may sit in the state cabin in the air and warmth and light she may even laugh with her lips but her heart is here with me in the hold  as i spoke i knew and knew not how i knew that the thing which i had said was true
with that knowledge came a happiness so deep and strong that it swept aside like straw the torment of those cords and the deeper hurt that i lay at his feet
i suppose my face altered and mirrored that blessed glow about my heart for into his own came a white fury changing its beauty into something inhuman and terrifying
he looked a devil baffled
for a minute he stood there rigid with hands clenched
embrace her heart if thou canst he said in a voice so low that it came like a whisper from the realm he might have left
i shall press my face against her bosom  another minute of a silence that i disdained to break then he turned and went up the ladder
the seamen and the master followed
the hatch was clapped to and fastened and we were left to the darkness and the heavy air and to a grim endurance of what could not be cured
during those hours of thirst and torment i came indeed to know the man who sat beside me
his hands were so fastened that he could not loosen the cords and there was no water for him to give me but he could and did bestow a higher almsthe tenderness of a brother the manly sympathy of a soldier the balm of the priest of god
i lay in silence and he spoke not often but when he did so there was that in the tone of his voiceanother cycle of pain and i awoke from a half swoon in which there was water to drink and no anguish to hear him praying beside me
he ceased to speak and in the darkness i heard him draw his breath hard and his great muscles crack
suddenly there came a sharp sound of breaking iron and a low thank thee lord another moment and i felt his hands busy at the knotted cords
i will have them off thee in a twinkling ralph he said thanks to him who taught my hands to war and my arms to break in two a bow of steel as he spoke the cords loosened beneath his fingers
i raised my head and laid it on his knee and he put his great arm with the broken chain dangling from it around me and like a mother with a babe crooned me to sleep with the twentythird psalm
chapter xxvi in which i am brought to trial   my lord came not again into the hold and the untied cords and the broken chain were not replaced
morning and evening we were brought a niggard allowance of bread and water but the man who carried it bore no light and may not even have observed their absence
we saw no one in authority
hour by hour my wounds healed and my strength returned
if it was a dark and noisome prison if there were hunger and thirst and inaction to be endured if we knew not how near to us might be a death of ignominy yet the minister and i found the jewel in the head of the toad for in that time of pain and heaviness we became as david and jonathan
at last some one came beside the brute who brought us food
a quiet gentleman with whitening hair and bright dark eyes stood before us
he had ordered the two men with him to leave open the hatch and he held in his hand a sponge soaked with vinegar
which of you isor rather wascaptain ralph percy he asked in a grave but pleasant voice
i am captain percy i answered
he looked at me with attention
i have heard of you before he said
i read the letter you wrote to sir edwyn sandys and thought it an excellently conceived and manly epistle
what magic transformed a gentleman and a soldier into a pirate  as he waited for me to speak i gave him for answer necessity  a sad metamorphosis he said
i had rather read of nymphs changed into laurel and gushing springs
i am come to take you sir before the officers of the company aboard this ship when if you have aught to say for yourself you may say it
i need not tell you who saw so clearly some time ago the danger in which you then stood that your plight is now a thousandfold worse  i am perfectly aware of it i said
am i to go in fetters  no he replied with a smile
i have no instructions on the subject but i will take it upon myself to free you from themeven for the sake of that excellently writ letter  is not this gentleman to go too i asked
he shook his head
i have no orders to that effect  while the men who were with him removed the irons from my wrists and ankles he stood in silence regarding me with a scrutiny so close that it would have been offensive had i been in a position to take offense
when they had finished i turned and held jeremy's hand in mine for an instant then followed the newcomer to the ladder and out of the hold the two men coming after us and resolving themselves above into a guard
as we traversed the main deck we came upon diccon busy with two or three others about the ports
he saw me and dropping the bar that he held started forward to be plucked back by an angry arm
the men who guarded me pushed in between us and there was no word spoken by either
i walked on the gentleman at my side and presently came to an open port and saw with an intake of my breath the sunshine a dark blue heaven flecked with white and a quiet ocean
my companion glanced at me keenly
doubtless it seems fair enough after that cimmerian darkness below  he remarked
would you like to rest here a moment  yes i said and leaning against the side of the port looked out at the beauty of the light
we are off hatteras he informed me but we have not met with the stormy seas that vex poor mariners hereabouts
those sails you see on our quarter belong to our consort
we were separated by the hurricane that nigh sunk us and finally drove us helpless as we were toward the florida coast and across your path
for us that was a fortunate reef upon which you dashed
the gods must have made your helmsman blind for he ran you into a destruction that gaped not for you
why did every wretch that we hung next morning curse you before he died  if i told you you would not believe me i replied
i was dizzy with the bliss of the air and the light and it seemed a small thing that he would not believe me
the wind sounded in my ears like a harp and the sea beckoned
a white bird flashed down into the crystal hollow between two waves hung there a second then rose a silver radiance against the blue
suddenly i saw a river dark and ridged beneath thunderclouds a boat and in it her head pillowed upon her arm a woman who pretended that she slept
with a shock my senses steadied and i became myself again
the sea was but the sea the wind the wind in the hold below me lay my friend somewhere in that ship was my wife and awaiting me in the state cabin were men who perhaps had the will as they had the right and the might to hang me at the yardarm that same hour
i have had my fill of rest i said
whom am i to stand before  the newly appointed officers of the company bound in this ship for virginia he answered
the ship carries sir francis wyatt the new governor master davison the secretary young clayborne the surveyor general the knight marshal the physician general and the treasurer with other gentlemen and with fair ladies their wives and sisters
i am george sandys the treasurer  the blood rushed to my face for it hurt me that the brother of sir edwyn sandys should believe that the firing of those guns had been my act
his was the trained observation of the traveler and writer and he probably read the color aright
i pity you if i can no longer esteem you he said after a pause
i know no sorrier sight than a brave man's shield reversed  i bit my lip and kept back the angry word
the next minute saw us at the door of the state cabin
it opened and my companion entered and i after him with my two guards at my back
around a large table were gathered a number of gentlemen some seated some standing
there were but two among them whom i had seen beforethe physician who had dressed my wound and my lord carnal
the latter was seated in a great chair beside a gentleman with a pleasant active face and light brown curling hairthe new governor as i guessed
the treasurer nodding to the two men to fall back to the window glided to a seat upon my lord's other hand and i went and stood before the governor of virginia
for some moments there was silence in the cabin every man being engaged in staring at me with all his eyes then the governor spoke it should be upon your knees sir  i am neither petitioner nor penitent i said
i know no reason why i should kneel your honor  there 's reason god wot why you should be both he exclaimed
did you not now some months agone defy the writ of the king and company refusing to stand when called upon to do so in the king's name  yes  did you not when he would have stayed your lawless flight lay violent hands upon a nobleman high in the king's favor and overpowering him with numbers carry him out of the king's realm  yes  did you not seduce from her duty to the king and force to fly with you his majesty's ward the lady jocelyn leigh  no i said
there was with me only my wife who chose to follow the fortunes of her husband  he frowned and my lord swore beneath his breath
did you not falling in with a pirate ship cast in your lot with the scoundrels upon it and yourself turn pirate  in some sort  and become their chief  since there was no other situation openyes  taking with you as captives upon the pirate ship that lady and that nobleman  yes  you proceeded to ravage the dominions of the king of spain with whom his majesty is at peace  like drake and raleighyes i said
he smiled then frowned tempora mutantur he said dryly
and i have never heard that drake or raleigh attacked an english ship  nor have i attacked one i said
he leaned back in his chair and stared at me
we saw the flame and heard the thunder of your guns and our rigging was cut by the shot
did you expect me to believe that last assertion  no  then you might have spared yourselfand usthat lie he said coldly
the treasurer moved restlessly in his seat and began to whisper to his neighbor the secretary
a young man with the eyes of a hawk and an iron jawclayborne the surveyor generalwho sat at the end of the table beside the window turned and gazed out upon the clouds and the sea as if contempt having taken the place of curiosity he had no further interest in the proceedings
as for me i set my face like a flint and looked past the man who might have saved me that last speech of the governor's as if he had never been
there was a closed door in the cabin opposite the one by which i had entered
suddenly from behind it came the sound of a short struggle followed by the quick turn of a key in the lock
the door was flung open and two women entered the cabin
one a fair young gentlewoman with tears in her brown eyes came forward hurriedly with outspread hands
i did what i could frank she cried
when she would not listen to reason i e'en locked the door but she is strong for all that she has been ill and she forced the key out of my hand she looked at the red mark upon the white hand and two tears fell from her long lashes upon her wildrose cheeks
with a smile the governor put out an arm and drew her down upon a stool beside him then rose and bowed low to the king's ward
you are not yet well enough to leave your cabin as our worthy physician general will assure you lady he said courteously but firmly
permit me to lead you back to it  still smiling he made as if to advance when she stayed him with a gesture of her raised hand at once so majestic and so pleading that it was as though a strain of music had passed through the stillness of the cabin
sir francis wyatt as you are a gentleman let me speak she said
it was the voice of that first night at weyanoke all pathos all sweetness all entreating
the governor stopped short the smile still upon his lips his hand still outstretchedstood thus for a moment then sat down
around the half circle of gentlemen went a little rustling sound like wind in dead leaves
my lord half rose from his seat
she is bewitched he said with dry lips
she will say what she has been told to say
lest she speak to her shame we should refuse to hear her  she had been standing in the centre of the floor her hands clasped her body bowed toward the governor but at my lord's words she straightened like a bow unbent
i may speak your honor she asked clearly
the governor who had looked askance at the working face of the man beside him slightly bent his head and leaned back in his great armchair
the king's favorite started to his feet
the king's ward turned her eyes upon him
sit down my lord she said
surely these gentlemen will think that you are afraid of what i a poor erring woman rebellious to the king traitress to mine own honor late the plaything of a pirate ship may say or do
truth my lord should be more courageous her voice was gentle even plaintive but it had in it the quality that lurks in the eyes of the crouching panther
my lord sat down one hand hiding his working mouth the other clenched on the arm of his chair as if it had been an arm of flesh
chapter xxvii in which i find an advocate   she came slowly nearer the ring of now very quiet and attentive faces until she stood beside me but she neither looked at me nor spoke to me
she was thinner and there were heavy shadows beneath her eyes but she was beautiful
i stand before gentlemen to whom perhaps i am not utterly unknown  she said
some here perchance have been to court and have seen me there
master sandys once before the queen died you came to greenwich to kiss her majesty's hands and while you waited in her antechamber you saw a young maid of honorscarce more than a childcurled in a window seat with a book
you sat beside her and told her wonderful tales of sunny lands and gods and nymphs
i was that maid of honor
master clayborne once hawking near windsor i dropped my glove
there were a many out of their saddles before it touched the ground but a gentleman not of our party who had drawn his horse to one side to let us pass was quicker than they all
did you not think yourself well paid sir when you kissed the hand to which you restored the glove
all here i think may have heard my name
if any hath heard aught that ever i did in all my life to tarnish it i pray him to speak now and shame me before you all  clayborne started up
i remember that day at windsor lady he cried
the man of whom i afterward asked your name was a most libertine courtier and he raised his hat when he spoke of you calling you a lily which the mire of the court could not besmirch
i will believe all good but no harm of you lady  he sat down and master sandys said gravely men need not be courtiers to have known of a lady of great wealth and high birth a ward of the king's and both beautiful and pure
i nor no man else i think ever heard aught of the lady jocelyn leigh but what became a daughter of her line  a murmur of assent went round the circle
the governor leaning forward from his seat his wife's hand in his gravely bent his head
all this is known lady he said courteously
she did not answer her eyes were upon the king's favorite and the circle waited with her
it is known said my lord
she smiled proudly
for so much grace thanks my lord she said then addressed herself again to the governor your honor that is the past the long past the long long past though not a year has gone by
then i was a girl proud and careless now your honor i am a woman and i stand here in the dignity of suffering and peril
i fled from englandshe paused drew herself up and turned upon my lord a face and form so still and yet so expressive of noble indignation outraged womanhood scorn and withal a kind of angry pity that small wonder if he shrank as from a blow
i left the only world i knew she said
i took a way low and narrow and dark and set with thorns but the only way that ialone and helpless and bewilderedcould find because that i jocelyn leigh willed not to wed with you my lord carnal
why did you follow me my lord
you knew that i loved you not
you knew my mind and that i was weak and friendless and you used your power
i must tell you my lord that you were not chivalrous nor compassionate nor brave  i loved you he cried and stretched out his arm toward her across the table
he saw no one but her spoke to none but her
there was a fierce yearning and a hopelessness in his voice and bent head and outstretched arm that lent for the time a tragic dignity to the pageant evil and magnificent of his life
you loved me she said
i had rather you had hated me my lord
i came to virginia your honor and men thought me the thing i professed myself
in the green meadow beyond the church they wooed me as such
this one came and that one and at last a fellow when i said him nay and bade him begone did dare to seize my hands and kiss my lips
while i struggled one came and flung that dastard out of the way then asked me plainly to become his wife and there was no laugh or insult in his voice
i was wearied and fordone and desperate
so i met my husband and so i married him
that same day i told him a part of my secret and when my lord carnal was come i told him all
i had not met with much true love or courtesy or compassion in my life
when i saw the danger in which he stood because of me i told him he might free himself from that coil might swear to what they pleased whistle me off save himself and i would say no word of blame
there was wine upon the table and he filled a cup and brought it to me and we drank of it together
we drank of the same cup then your honor and we will drink of it still
we twain were wedded and the world strove to part us
which of you here in such quarrel would not withstand the world
lady wyatt would not thy husband hold thee while he lived against the world
then speak for mine  frank frank cried lady wyatt
they love each other  if he withstood the king went on the king's ward it was for his honor and for mine
if he fled from virginia it was because i willed it so
had he stayed my lord carnal and had you willed to follow me again you must have made a yet longer journey to a most distant bourne
that wild night when we fled why did you come upon us my lord
the moon burst forth from a black cloud and you stood there upon the wharf above us calling to the footsteps behind to hasten
we would have left you there in safety and gone ourselves alone down that stream as black and strange as death
why did you spring down the steps and grapple with the minister
and he that might have thrust you beneath the flood and drowned you there did but fling you into the boat
we wished not your company my lord we would willingly have gone without you
i trust my lord you have made honest report of this matter and have told these gentlemen that my husband gave you a prisoner whom he wanted not all fair and honorable treatment
that you have done this i dare take my oath my lord  she stood silent her eyes upon his
the men around stirred and a little flash like the glint of drawn steel went from one pair of eyes to another
my lord my lord said the king's ward
long ago you won my hatred an you would not win my contempt speak truth this day  in his eyes which he had never taken from her face there leaped to meet the proud appeal in her own a strange fire
that he loved her with a great and evil passion i who needs had watched him closely had long known
suddenly he burst into jarring laughter
yea he treated me fairly enough damn him to everlasting hell
but he 's a pirate sweet bird he's a pirate and must swing as such  a pirate she cried
but he was none
my lord you know he was none
your honor  the governor interrupted her he made himself captain of a pirate ship lady
he took and sunk ships of spain  in what sort did he become their chief she cried
in such sort gentlemen as the bravest of you in like straits would have been blithe to be an you had had like measure of wit and daring
your honor the wind before which our boat drave like a leaf the waves that would engulf us wrecked us upon a desert isle
there was no food or water or shelter
that night while we slept a pirate ship anchored off the beach and in the morning the pirates came ashore to bury their captain
my husband met them alone fought their wouldbe leaders one by one and forced the election to fall upon himself
well he knew that if he left not that isle their leader he would leave it their captive and not he alone
god's mercy gentlemen what other could he do
i pray you to hold him absolved from a willing embrace of that life
sunk ships of spain
yea forsooth and how long hath it been since other english gentlemen sunk other ships of spain
the world hath changed indeed if to fight the spaniard in the indies e'en though at home we be at peace with him be conceived so black a crime
he fought their galleons fair and knightly with his life in his hand he gave quarter and while they called him chief those pirates tortured no prisoner and wronged no woman
had he not been there would the ships have been taken less surely
had he not been there god wot ships and ships' boats alike would have sunk or burned and no spanish men and women had rowed away and blessed a generous foe
a pirate
he with me and with the minister and with my lord carnal was prisoner to the pirates and out of that danger he plucked safety for us all
who hath so misnamed a gallant gentleman
was it you my lord  eyes and voice were imperious and in her cheeks burned an indignant crimson
my lord's face was set and white he looked at her but spoke no word
the spanish ships might pass lady said the governor but this is an english ship with the flag of england above her  yea she said
what then  the circle rustled again
the governor loosed his wife's fingers and leaned forward
you plead well lady he exclaimed
you might win an captain percy had not seen fit to fire upon us  a dead silence followed his words
outside the square window a cloud passed from the face of the sun and a great burst of sunshine entered the cabin
she stood in the heart of it and looked a goddess angered
my lord with his haggard face and burning eyes slowly rose from his seat and they faced each other
you told them not who fired those guns who sunk that pirate ship  she said
because he was your enemy you held your tongue
knight and gentlemanmy lord carnalmy lord coward  honor is an empty word to me he answered
for you i would dive into the deepest hellif there be a deeper than that which burns me day in day out jocelyn jocelyn jocelyn  you love me so she said
then do me pleasure
because i ask it of you tell these men the truth she came a step nearer and held out her clasped hands to him
tell them how it was my lord and i will strive to hate you no longer
the harm that you have done me i will pray for strength to forgive
ah my lord let me not ask in vain
will you that i kneel to you  i fix my own price he said
i will do what you ask an you will let me kiss your lips  i sprang forward with an oath
some one behind caught both my wrists in an iron grasp and pulled me back
be not a fool growled clayborne in my ear
the cord's loosening fast if you interfere it may tighten with a jerk i freed my hands from his grasp
the treasurer sitting next him leaned across the table and motioned to the two seamen beside the window
they left their station and each seized me by an arm
be guided captain percy said master sandys in a low voice
we wish you well
let her win you through  first tell the truth my lord said the king's ward then come and take the reward you ask  jocelyn i cried
i command you  she turned upon me a perfectly colorless face
all my life after i will be to you an obedient wife she said
this once i pray you to hold me excused
speak my lord  there was the mirth of the lost in the laugh with which he turned to the governor
that pretty little tale sir that i regaled you with the day you obligingly picked me up was pure imagination the wetting must have disordered my reason
a potion sweeter than the honey of hybla which i am about to drink hath restored me beforehand
gentlemen all there was mutiny aboard that ship which so providentially sank before your very eyes
for why
the crew who were pirates and the captain who was yonder gentleman did not agree
the one wished to attack you board you rummage you and slay after recondite fashions every mother's son of you the other demurredso strongly in fact that his life ceased to be worth a pin's purchase
indeed i believe he resigned his captaincy then and there and declining to lift a finger against an english ship defied them to do their worst
he had no hand in the firing of those culverins the mutineers touched them off without so much as a 'by your leave'
his attention was otherwise occupied
good sirs there was not the slightest reason in nature why the ship should have struck upon that sunken reef to the damnation of her people and the salvation of yours
why do you suppose she diverged from the path of safety to split into slivers against that fortunate ledge  the men around drew in their breath and one or two sprang to their feet
my lord laughed again
have you seen the pious man who left jamestown and went aboard the pirate ship as this gentleman's lieutenant
he hath the strength of a bull
captain percy here had but to nod his head and hey presto
the helmsman was bowled over and the minister had the helm
the ship struck the pirates went to hell and you gentlemen were preserved to order all things well in virginia
may she long be grateful
the man who dared that death rather than attack the ship he guessed to be the company's is my mortal foe whom i will yet sweep from my path but he is not a pirate
ay take it down an it please you master secretary
i retreat from a most choice position to be sure but what care i
i see a vantage ground more to my liking
i have lost a throw perhaps but i will recoup ten such losses with one such kiss
by your leave lady  he went up to her where she stood with hanging arms her head a little bent white and cold and yielding as a lady done in snow gazed at her a moment with his passion written in his fierce eyes and haggard handsome face then crushed her to him
if i could have struck him dead i would have done so
when her word had been kept she released herself with a quiet and resolute dignity
as for him he sank back into the great chair beside the governor's leaned an elbow on the table and hid his eyes with one shaking hand
the governor rose to his feet and motioned away the two seamen who held me fast
we'll have no hanging this morning gentlemen he announced
captain percy i beg to apologize to you for words that were never meant for a brave and gallant gentleman but for a pirate who i find does not exist
i pray you to forget them quite  i returned his bow but my eyes traveled past him
i will allow you no words with my lord carnal he said
with your wifethat is different he moved aside with a smile
she was standing pale with downcast eyes where my lord had left her
jocelyn i said
she turned toward me crimsoned deeply uttered a low cry half laughter half a sob then covered her face with her hands
i took them away and spoke her name again and this time she hid her face upon my breast
a moment thus thenfor all eyes were upon heri lifted her head kissed her and gave her to lady wyatt whom i found at my side
i commend my wife to your ladyship's care i said
as you are woman deal sisterly by her  you may trust me sir she made answer the tears upon her cheeks
i did not knowi did not understanddear heart come awaycome away with margaret wyatt  clayborne opened the door of the cabin and stood aside with a low bow
the men who had sat to judge me rose only the king's favorite kept his seat
with lady wyatt's arm about her the king's ward passed between the lines of standing gentlemen to the door there hesitated turned and facing them with i know not what of pride and shame wistfulness of entreaty and noble challenge to belief in the face and form that were of all women's most beautiful curtsied to them until her knee touched the floor
she was gone and the sunlight with her
when i turned upon that shameless lord where he sat in his evil beauty with his honor dead before him men came hastily in between
i put them aside with a laugh
i had but wanted to look at him
i had no swordalready he lay beneath my challengeand words are weak things
at length he rose as arrogant as ever in his port as evilly superb in his towering pride and as amazingly indifferent to the thoughts of men who lied not
this case hath wearied me he said
i will retire for a while to rest and in dreams to live over a past sweetness
give you goodday gentles
sir francis wyatt you will remember that this gentleman did resist arrest and that he lieth under the king's displeasure so saying he clapped his hat upon his head and walked out of the cabin
the company's officers drew a long breath as if a fresher air had come in with his departure
i have no choice captain percy but to keep you still under restraint both here and when we shall reach jamestown said the governor
all that the company through me can do consistent with its duty to his majesty to lighten your confinement shall be done  then send him not again into the hold sir francis exclaimed the treasurer with a wry face
the governor laughed
lighter and sweeter quarters shall be found
your wife's a brave lady captain percy  and a passing fair one said claybourne under his breath
i left a friend below in the hold your honor i said
he came with me from jamestown because he was my friend
the king hath never heard of him
and he's no more a pirate than i or you your honor
he is a ministera sober meek and godly man  from behind the secretary rose the singsong of my acquaintance of the hold dr john pott
he is jeremy your honor jeremy who made the town merry at blackfriars
your honor remembers him
he had a sickness and forsook the life and went into the country
he was known to the dean of st paul's
all the town laughed when it heard that he had taken orders  jeremy cried out the treasurer
nick bottom
christopher sly
sir toby belch
sir francis give me jeremy to keep in my cabin  the governor laughed
he shall be bestowed with captain percy where he'll not lack for company i warrant
jeremy
ben jonson loved him they drank together at the mermaid  a little later the treasurer turned to leave my new quarters to which he had walked beside me glanced at the men who waited for him withoutjeremy had not yet been brought from the holdand returned to my side to say in a low voice but with emphasis captain percy has been a long time without news from homefrom england
what would he most desire to hear  of the welfare of his grace of buckingham i replied
he smiled
his grace is as well as heart could desire and as powerful
the queen's dog now tuggeth the sow by the ears this way or that as it pleaseth him
since we are not to hang you as a pirate captain percy i incline to think your affairs in better posture than when you left virginia  i think so too sir i said and gave him thanks for his courtesy and wished him goodday being anxious to sit still and thank god with my face in my hands and summer in my heart
chapter xxviii in which the springtime is at hand   tired of dicing against myself and of the books that rolfe had sent me i betook myself to the gaol window and leaning against the bars looked out in search of entertainment
the nearest if not the merriest thing the prospect had to offer was the pillory
it was built so tall that it was but little lower than the low upper story of the gaol and it faced my window at so short a distance that i could hear the long whistling breath of the wretch who happened to occupy it
it was not a pleasant sound neither was a livid face new branded on the cheek with a great r and with a trickle of dark blood from the mutilated ears staining the board in which the head was immovably fixed a pleasant sight
a little to one side was the whipping post a woman had been whipped that morning and her cries had tainted the air even more effectually than had the decayed matter with which certain small devils had pelted the runaway in the pillory
i looked away from the poor rogue below me into the clear hard brightness of the march day and was most heartily weary of the bars between me and it
the wind blew keenly the sky was blue as blue could be and the river a great ribbon of azure sewn with diamonds
all colors were vivid and all distances near
there was no haze over the forest brown and bare it struck the cloudless blue
the marsh was emerald the green of the pines deep and rich the budding maples redder than coral
the church with the low green graves around it appeared not a stone's throw away and the voices of the children up and down the street sounded clearly as though they played in the brown square below me
when the drum beat for the nooning the roll was close in my ears
the world looked so bright and keen that it seemed new made and the brilliant sunshine and the cold wind stirred the blood like wine
now and then men and women passed through the square below
wellnigh all glanced up at the window and their eyes were friendly
it was known now that buckingham was paramount at home and my lord carnal's following in virginia was much decayed
young hamor strode by bravely dressed and whistling cheerily and doffed a hat with a most noble broken feather
we're going to bait a bear below the fort he called
sorry you'll miss the sport
there will be all the worldand my lord carnal he whistled himself away and presently there came along master edward sharpless
he stopped and stared at the rogue in the pillorywith no prescience i suppose of a day when he was to stand there himself then looked up at me with as much malevolence as his small soul could write upon his mean features and passed on
he had a jaded look moreover his clothes were swampstained and his cloak had been torn by briers
what did you go to the forest for i muttered
the key grated in the door behind me and it opened to admit the gaoler and diccon with my dinnerwhich i was not sorry to see
sir george sent the venison sir said the gaoler grinning and master piersey the wild fowl and madam west the pasty and the marchpane and master pory the sack
be there anything you lack sir  nothing that you can supply i answered curtly
the fellow grinned again straightened the things upon the table and started for the door
you can stay until i come for the platters  he said to diccon and went out locking the door after him with ostentation
i applied myself to the dinner and diccon went to the window and stood there looking out at the blue sky and at the man in the pillory
he had the freedom of the gaol
i was somewhat more straitly confined though my friends had easy access to me
as for jeremy sparrow he had spent twentyfour hours in gaol at the end of which time madam west had a fit of the spleen declared she was dying and insisted upon master sparrow's being sent for to administer consolation master bucke unfortunately having gone up to henricus on business connected with the college
from the bedside of that despotic lady sparrow was called to bury a man on the other side of the river and from the grave to marry a couple at mulberry island
and the next day being sunday and no minister at hand he preached again in master bucke's pulpitand preached a sermon so powerful and moving that its like had never been heard in virginia
they marched him not back from the pulpit to gaol
there were but five ministers in virginia and there were a many more sick to visit and dead to bury
master bucke still feeble in body tarried up river discussing with thorpe the latter's darling project of converting every imp of an indian this side the south sea and jeremy slipped into his old place
there had been some talk of a public censure but it died away
the pasty and sack disposed of i turned in my seat and spoke to diccon i looked for master rolfe today
have you heard aught of him  no he answered
as he spoke the door was opened and the gaoler put in his head
a messenger from master rolfe captain he drew back and the indian nantauquas entered the room
rolfe i had seen twice since the arrival of the george at jamestown but the indian had not been with him
the young chief now came forward and touched the hand i held out to him
my brother will be here before the sun touches the tallest pine he announced in his grave calm voice
he asks captain percy to deny himself to any other that may come
he wishes to see him alone  i shall hardly be troubled with company i said
there's a bearbaiting toward  nantauquas smiled
my brother asked me to find a bear for today
i bought one from the paspaheghs for a piece of copper and took him to the ring below the fort  where all the town will presently be gone i said
i wonder what rolfe did that for  filling a cup with sack i pushed it to the indian across the table
you are little in the woods nowadays nantauquas  his fine dark face clouded ever so slightly
opechancanough has dreamt that i am indian no longer
singing birds have lied to him telling him that i love the white man and hate my own color
he calls me no more his brave his brother powhatan's dear son
i do not sit by his council fire now nor do i lead his war bands
when i went last to his lodge and stood before him his eyes burned me like the coals the monacans once closed my hands upon
he would not speak to me  it would not fret me if he never spoke again i said
you have been to the forest today  yes he replied glancing at the smear of leaf mould upon his beaded moccasins
captain percy's eyes are quick he should have been an indian
i went to the paspaheghs to take them the piece of copper
i could tell captain percy a curious thing  well i demanded as he paused
i went to the lodge of the werowance with the copper and found him not there
the old men declared that he had gone to the weirs for fishhe and ten of his braves
the old men lied
i had passed the weirs of the paspaheghs and no man was there
i sat and smoked before the lodge and the maidens brought me chinquapin cakes and pohickory for nantauquas is a prince and a welcome guest to all save opechancanough
the old men smoked with their eyes upon the ground each seeing only the days when he was even as nantauquas
they never knew when a wife of the werowance turned child by pride unfolded a doeskin and showed nantauquas a silver cup carved all over and set with colored stones  humph  the cup was a heavy price to pay continued the indian
i do not know what great thing it bought  humph i said again
did you happen to meet master edward sharpless in the forest  he shook his head
the forest is wide and there are many trails through it
nantauquas looked for that of the werowance of the paspaheghs but found it not
he had no time to waste upon a white man  he gathered his otterskin mantle about him and prepared to depart
i rose and gave him my hand for i thoroughly liked him and in the past he had made me his debtor
tell rolfe he will find me alone i said and take my thanks for your pains nantauquas
if ever we hunt together again may i have the chance to serve you
i bear the scars of the wolf's teeth yet you came in the nick of time that day  the indian smiled
it was a fierce old wolf
i wish captain percy free with all my heart and then we will hunt more wolves he and i  when he was gone and the gaoler and diccon with him i returned to the window
the runaway in the pillory was released and went away homewards staggering beside his master's stirrup
passersby grew more and more infrequent and up the street came faint sounds of laughter and hurrahingthe bear must be making good sport
i could see the halfmoon and the guns and the flag that streamed in the wind and on the river a sail or two white in the sunlight as the gulls that swooped past
beyond rose the bare masts of the george
the santa teresa rode no more forever in the james
the king's ship was gone home to the king without the freight he looked for
three days and the george would spread her white wings and go down the wide river and i with her and the king's ward and the king's sometime favorite
i looked down the windruffled stream and saw the great bay into which it emptied and beyond the bay the heaving ocean dark and light league on league league on league then green england and london and the tower
the vision disturbed me less than once it would have done
men that i knew and trusted were to be passengers on that ship as well as one i knew and did not trust
and if at the journey's end i saw the tower i saw also his grace of buckingham
where i hated he hated and was now powerful enough to strike
the wind blew from the west from the unknown
i turned my head and it beat against my forehead cold and fragrant with the essence of the forestpine and cedar dead leaves and black mould fen and hollow and hillall the world of woods over which it had passed
the ghost of things long dead which face or voice could never conjure up will sometimes start across our path at the beckoning of an odor
a day in the starving time came back to me how i had dragged myself from our broken palisade and crazy huts and the groans of the famished and the plaguestricken and the presence of the unburied dead across the neck and into the woods and had lain down there to die being taken with a sick fear and horror of the place of cannibals behind me and how weak i wastoo weak to care any more
i had been a strong man and it had come to that and i was content to let it be
the smell of the woods that day the chill brown earth beneath me the blowing wind the long stretch of the river gleaming between the pines and fair in sight the white sails of the patience and the deliverance
i had been too nigh gone then to greatly care that i was saved now i cared and thanked god for my life
come what might in the future the past was mine
though i should never see my wife again i had that hour in the state cabin of the george
i loved and was loved again
there was a noise outside the door and rolfe's voice speaking to the gaoler
impatient for his entrance i started toward the door but when it opened he made no move to cross the threshold
i am not coming in  he said with a face that he strove to keep grave
i only came to bring some one else with that he stepped back and a second figure coming forward out of the dimness behind him crossed the threshold
it was a woman cloaked and hooded
the door was drawn to behind her and we were alone together
beside the cloak and hood she wore a riding mask
do you know who it is she asked when she had stood so shrouded for a long minute during which i had found no words with which to welcome her
yea i answered the princess in the fairy tale  she freed her dark hair from its covering and unclasping her cloak let it drop to the floor
shall i unmask she asked with a sigh
faith
i should keep the bit of silk between your eyes sir and my blushes
am i ever to be the forward one
do you not think me too bold a lady as she spoke her white hands were busy about the fastening of her mask
the knot is too hard she murmured with a little tremulous laugh and a catch of her breath
i untied the ribbons
may i not sit down she said plaintively but with soft merriment in her eyes
i am not quite strong yet
my heartyou do not know what pain i have in my heart sometimes
it makes me weep of nights and when none are by indeed it does  there was a settle beneath the window
i led her to it and she sat down
you must know that i am walking in the governor's garden that hath only a lane between it and the gaol her eyes were downcast her cheeks pure rose
when did you first love me i demanded
lady wyatt must have guessed why master rolfe alone went not to the bearbaiting but joined us in the garden
she said the air was keen and fetched me her mask and then herself went indoors to embroider samson in the arms of delilah'
was it here at jamestown or was it when we were first wrecked or on the island with the pink hill when you wrote my name in the sand or  the george will sail in three days and we are to be taken back to england after all
it does not scare me now  in all my life i have kissed you only once i said
the rose deepened and in her eyes there was laughter with tears behind
you are a gentleman of determination she said
if you are bent upon having your way i do not know that ithat ican help myself
i do not even know that i want to help myself  outside the wind blew and the sun shone and the laughter from below the fort was too far away and elfin to jar upon us
the world forgot us and we were well content
there seemed not much to say i suppose we were too happy for words
i knelt beside her and she laid her hands in mine and now and then we spoke
in her short and lonely life and in my longer stern and crowded one there had been little tenderness little happiness
in her past to those about her she had seemed bright and gay i had been a comrade whom men liked because i could jest as well as fight
now we were happy but we were not gay
each felt for the other a great compassion each knew that though we smiled today the groan and the tear might be tomorrow's due the sunshine around us was pure gold but that the clouds were mounting we knew full well
i must soon be gone she said at last
it is a stolen meeting
i do not know when we shall meet again  she rose from the settle and i rose with her and we stood together beside the barred window
there was no danger of her being seen street and square were left to the wind and the sunshine
my arm was around her and she leaned her head against my breast
perhaps we shall never meet again she said
the winter is over i answered
soon the trees will be green and the flowers in bloom
i will not believe that our spring can have no summer  she took from her bosom a little flower that had been pinned there
it lay a purple star in the hollow of her hand
it grew in the sun
it is the first flower of spring she put it to her lips then laid it upon the window ledge beside my hand
i have brought you evil giftsfoes and strife and peril
will you take this little purple flowerand all my heart beside  i bent and kissed first the tiny blossom and then the lips that had proffered it
i am very rich i said
the sun was now low and the pines in the square and the upright of the pillory cast long shadows
the wind had fallen and the sounds had died away
it seemed very still
nothing moved but the creeping shadows until a flight of small whitebreasted birds went past the window
the snow is gone i said
the snowbirds are flying north  the woods will soon be green she murmured wistfully
ah if we could ride through them once more back to weyanoke  to home i said
home she echoed softly
there was a low knocking at the door behind us
it is master rolfe's signal she said
i must not stay
tell me that you love me and let me go  i drew her closer to me and pressed my lips upon her bowed head
do you not know that i love you i asked
yea she answered
i have been taught it
tell me that you believe that god will be good to us
tell me that we shall be happy yet for oh i have a boding heart this day  her voice broke and she lay trembling in my arms her face hidden
if the summer never comes for usshe whispered
goodby my lover and my husband
if i have brought you ruin and death i have brought you too a love that is very great
forgive me and kiss me and let me go  thou art my dearly loved and honored wife i said
my heart forebodes summer and joy and peace and home  we kissed each other solemnly as those who part for a journey and a warfare
i spoke no word to rolfe when the door was opened and she had passed out with her cloak drawn about her face but we clasped hands and each knew the other for his friend indeed
they were gone the gaoler closing and locking the door behind them
as for me i went back to the settle beneath the window and falling on my knees beside it buried my face in my arms
chapter xxix in which i keep tryst   the sun dropped below the forest blood red dyeing the river its own color
there were no clouds in the skyonly a great suffusion of crimson climbing to the zenith against it the woods were as black as war paint
the color faded and the night set in a night of no wind and of numberless stars
on the hearth burned a fire
i left the window and sat beside it and in the hollows between the red embers made pictures as i used to make them when i was a boy
i sat there long
it grew late and all sounds in the town were hushed only now and then the all's well of the watch came faintly to my ears
diccon lodged with me he lay in his clothes upon a pallet in the far corner of the room but whether he slept or not i did not ask
he and i had never wasted words since chance had thrown us together again we spoke only when occasion required
the fire was nigh out and it must have been ten of the clock when with somewhat more of caution and less of noise than usual the key grated in the lock the door opened and the gaoler entered closing it noiselessly behind him
there was no reason why he should intrude himself upon me after nightfall and i regarded him with a frown and an impatience that presently turned to curiosity
he began to move about the room making pretense of seeing that there was water in the pitcher beside my pallet that the straw beneath the coverlet was fresh that the bars of the window were firm and ended by approaching the fire and heaping pine upon it
it flamed up brilliantly and in the strong red light he half opened a clenched hand and showed me two gold pieces and beneath them a folded paper
i looked at his furtive eyes and brutal doltish face but he kept them blank as a wall
the hand closed again over the treasure within it and he turned away as if to leave the room
i drew a nobleone of a small store of gold pieces conveyed to me by rolfefrom my pocket and stooping made it spin upon the hearth in the red firelight
the gaoler looked at it askance but continued his progress toward the door
i drew out its fellow set it too to spinning then leaned back against the table
they hunt in couples i said
there will be no third one  he had his foot upon them before they had done spinning
the next moment they had kissed the two pieces already in his possession and he had transferred all four to his pocket
i held out my hand for the paper and he gave it to me grudgingly with a spiteful slowness of movement
he would have stayed beside me as i read it but i sternly bade him keep his distance then kneeling before the fire to get the light i opened the paper
it was written upon in a delicate woman's hand and it ran thus  an you hold me dear come to me at once
come without tarrying to the deserted hut on the neck of land nearest to the forest
as you love me as you are my knight keep this tryst
in distress and peril thy wife
folded with it was a line in the commander's hand and with his signature the bearer may pass without the palisade at his pleasure  i read the first paper again refolded it and rose to my feet
who brought this sirrah i demanded
his answer was glib enough one of the governor's servants
he said as how there was no harm in the letter and the gold was good  when was this  just now
no i did n't know the man  i saw no way to discover whether or not he lied
drawing out another gold piece i laid it upon the table
he eyed it greedily edging nearer and nearer
for leaving this door unlocked i said
his eyes narrowed and he moistened his lips shifting from one foot to the other
i put down a second piece
for opening the outer door i said
he wet his lips again made an inarticulate sound in his throat and finally broke out with the commander will nail my ears to the pillory  you can lock the doors after me and know as little as you choose in the morning
no gain without some risk  that's so he agreed and made a clutch at the gold
i swept it out of his reach
first earn it i said dryly
look at the foot of the pillory an hour from now and you'll find it
i'll not pay you this side of the doors  he bit his lips and studied the floor
you're a gentleman he growled at last
i suppose i can trust ye  i suppose you can  taking up his lantern he turned toward the door
it 's growing late  he said with a most uncouth attempt to feign a guileless drowsiness
i'll to bed captain when i've locked up
goodnight to ye  he was gone and the door was left unlocked
i could walk out of that gaol as i could have walked out of my house at weyanoke
i was free but should i take my freedom
going back to the light of the fire i unfolded the paper and stared at it turning its contents this way and that in my mind
the handbut once had i seen her writing and then it had been wrought with a shell upon firm sand
i could not judge if this were the same
had the paper indeed come from her
had it not
if in truth it was a message from my wife what had befallen in a few hours since our parting
if it was a forger's lie what trap was set what toils were laid
i walked up and down and tried to think it out
the strangeness of it all the choice of a lonely and distant hut for trysting place that pass coming from a sworn officer of the company certain things i had heard that day a trap and to walk into it with my eyes open an you hold me dear
as you are my knight keep this tryst
in distress and peril come what might there was a risk i could not run
i had no weapons to assume no preparations to make
gathering up the gaoler's gold i started toward the door opened it and going out would have closed it softly behind me but that a booted leg thrust across the jamb prevented me
i am going with you said diccon in a guarded voice
if you try to prevent me i will rouse the house his head was thrown back in the old way the old daredevil look was upon his face
i don't know why you are going he declared but there'll be danger anyhow  to the best of my belief i am walking into a trap i said
then it will shut on two instead of one he answered doggedly
by this he was through the door and there was no shadow of turning on his dark determined face
i knew my man and wasted no more words
long ago it had grown to seem the thing most in nature that the hour of danger should find us side by side
when the door of the firelit room was shut the gaol was in darkness that might be felt
it was very still the few other inmates were fast asleep the gaoler was somewhere out of sight dreaming with open eyes
we groped our way through the passage to the stairs noiselessly descended them and found the outer door unchained unbarred and slightly ajar
when i had laid the gold beneath the pillory we struck swiftly across the square being in fear lest the watch should come upon us and took the first lane that led toward the palisade
beneath the burning stars the town lay stark in sleep
so bright in the wintry air were those faraway lights that the darkness below them was not great
we could see the low houses the shadowy pines the naked oaks the sandy lane glimmering away to the river starstrewn to match the heavens
the air was cold but exceedingly clear and still
now and then a dog barked or wolves howled in the forest across the river
we kept in the shadow of the houses and the trees and went with the swiftness silence and caution of indians
the last house we must pass before reaching the palisade was one that rolfe owned and in which he lodged when business brought him to jamestown
it and some low outbuildings beyond it were as dark as the cedars in which they were set and as silent as the grave
rolfe and his indian brother were sleeping there now while i stood without
or did they sleep
were they there at all
might it not have been rolfe who had bribed the gaoler and procured the pass from west
might i not find him at that strange trysting place
might not all be well after all
i was sorely tempted to rouse that silent house and demand if its master were within
i did it not
servants were there and noise would be made and time that might be more precious than lifeblood was flying fast
i went on and diccon with me
there was a cabin built almost against the palisade and here one man was supposed to watch whilst another slept
tonight we found both asleep
i shook the younger to his feet and heartily cursed him for his negligence
he listened stupidly and read as stupidly by the light of his lantern the pass which i thrust beneath his nose
staggering to his feet and drunk with his unlawful slumber he fumbled at the fastenings of the gate for full three minutes before the ponderous wood finally swung open and showed the road beyond
it's all right he muttered thickly
the commander's pass
goodnight the three of ye  are you drunk or drugged i demanded
there are only two
it's not sleep that is the matter with you
what is it  he made no answer but stood holding the gate open and blinking at us with dull unseeing eyes
something ailed him besides sleep he may have been drugged for aught i know
when we had gone some yards from the gate we heard him say again in precisely the same tone goodnight the three of ye then the gate creaked to and we heard the bars drawn across it
without the palisade was a space of waste land marsh and thicket tapering to the narrow strip of sand and scrub joining the peninsula to the forest and here and there upon this waste ground rose a mean house dwelt in by the poorer sort
all were dark
we left them behind and found ourselves upon the neck with the desolate murmur of the river on either hand and before us the deep blackness of the forest
suddenly diccon stopped in his tracks and turned his head
i did hear something then he muttered
look sir  the stars faintly lit the road that had been trodden hard and bare by the feet of all who came and went
down this road something was coming toward us something low and dark that moved not fast and not slow but with a measured and relentless pace
a panther said diccon
we watched the creature with more of curiosity than alarm
unless brought to bay or hungry or wantonly irritated these great cats were cowardly enough
it would hardly attack the two of us
nearer and nearer it came showing no signs of anger and none of fear and paying no attention to the withered branch with which diccon tried to scare it off
when it was so close that we could see the white of its breast it stopped looking at us with large unfaltering eyes and slightly moving its tail to and fro
a tame panther ejaculated diccon
it must be the one nantauquas tamed sir
he would have kept it somewhere near master rolfe's house  and it heard us and followed us through the gate i said
it was the third the warder talked of  we walked on and the beast addressing itself to motion followed at our heels
now and then we looked back at it but we feared it not
as for me i had begun to think that a panther might be the least formidable thing i should meet that night
by this i had scarcely any hopeor fearthat i should find her at our journey's end
the lonesome path that led only to the nighttime forest the deep and dark river with its mournful voice the hard bright pitiless stars the cold the loneliness the distancehow should she be there
and if not she who then
the hut to which i had been directed stood in an angle made by the neck and the main bank of the river
on one side of it was the water on the other a deep wood
the place had an evil name and no man had lived there since the planter who had built it hanged himself upon its threshold
the hut was ruinous in the summer tall weeds grew up around it and venomous snakes harbored beneath its rotted and broken floor in the winter the snow whitened it and the wild fowl flew screaming in and out of the open door and the windows that needed no barring
tonight the door was shut and the windows in some way obscured
but the interstices between the logs showed red the hut was lighted within and some one was keeping tryst
the stillness was deadly
it was not silence for the river murmured in the stiff reeds and far off in the midnight forest some beast of the night uttered its cry but a hush a holding of the breath an expectant horror
the door warped and shrunken was drawn to but was not fastened as i could tell by the unbroken line of red light down one side from top to bottom
making no sound i laid my hand upon it pushed it open a little way and looked within the hut
i had thought to find it empty or to find it crowded
it was neither
a torch lit it and on the hearth burned a fire
drawn in front of the blaze was an old rude chair and in it sat a slight figure draped from head to foot in a black cloak
the head was bowed and hidden the whole attitude one of listlessness and dejection
as i looked there came a long tremulous sigh and the head drooped lower and lower as if in a growing hopelessness
the revulsion of feeling was so great that for the moment i was dazed as by a sudden blow
there had been time during the walk from the gaol for enough of wild and whirling thoughts as to what should greet me in that hut and now the slight figure by the fire the exquisite melancholy of its posture its bent head the weeping i could divinei had but one thought to comfort her as quickly as i might
diccon's hand was upon my arm but i shook it off and pushing the door open crossed the uneven and noisy floor to the fire and bent over the lonely figure beside it
jocelyn i said i have kept tryst  as i spoke i laid my hand upon the bowed and covered head
it was raised the cloak was drawn aside and there looked me in the eyes the italian
as if it had been the gorgon's gaze i was turned to stone
the filmy eyes the smile that would have been mocking had it not been so very faint the pallor the malignancei stared and stared and my heart grew cold and sick
it was but for a minute then a warning cry from diccon roused me
i sprang backward until the width of the hearth was between me and the italian then wheeled and found myself face to face with the king's late favorite
behind him was an open door and beyond it a small inner room dimly lighted
he stood and looked at me with an insolence and a triumph most intolerable
his drawn sword was in his hand the jeweled hilt blazing in the firelight and on his dark superb face a taunting smile
i met it with one as bold at least but i said no word good or bad
in the cabin of the george i had sworn to myself that thenceforward my sword should speak for me to this gentleman
you came he said
i thought you would  i glanced around the hut seeking for a weapon
seeing nothing more promising than the thick halfconsumed torch i sprang to it and wrested it from the socket
diccon caught up a piece of rusted iron from the hearth and together we faced my lord's drawn sword and a small sharp and strangely shaped dagger that the italian drew from a velvet sheath
my lord laughed reading my thoughts
you are mistaken he declared coolly
i am content that captain percy knows i do not fear to fight him
this time i play to win turning toward the outer door he raised his hand with a gesture of command
in an instant the room was filled
the redbrown figures naked save for the loincloth and the headdress the impassive faces dashed with black the ruthless eyesi knew now why master edward sharpless had gone to the forest and what service had been bought with that silver cup
the paspaheghs and i were old enemies doubtless they would find their task a pleasant one
my own knaves unfortunately were out of the way sent home on the santa teresa said my lord still smiling
i am not yet so poor that i cannot hire others
true nicolo might have done the work just now when you bent over him so lovingly and spoke so softly but the river might give up your body to tell strange tales
i have heard that the indians are more ingenious and leave no such witness anywhere  before the words were out of his mouth i had sprung upon him and had caught him by the sword wrist and the throat
he strove to free his hand to withdraw himself from my grasp
locked together we struggled backward and forward in what seemed a blaze of lights and a roaring as of mighty waters
red hands caught at me sharp knives panted to drink my blood but so fast we turned and writhed now he uppermost now i that for very fear of striking the wrong man hands and knives could not be bold
i heard diccon fighting and knew that there would be howling tomorrow among the squaws of the paspaheghs
with all his might my lord strove to bend the sword against me and at last did cut me across the arm causing the blood to flow freely
it made a pool upon the floor and once my foot slipped in it and i stumbled and almost fell
two of the paspaheghs were silent for evermore
diccon had the knife of the first to fall and it ran red
the italian quick and sinuous as a serpent kept beside my lord and me striving to bring his dagger to his master's aid
we two panted hard before our eyes blood within our ears the sea
the noise of the other combatants suddenly fell
the hush could only mean that diccon was dead or taken
i could not look behind to see
with an access of fury i drove my antagonist toward a corner of the hutthe corner so it chanced in which the panther had taken up its quarters
with his heel he struck the beast out of his way then made a last desperate effort to throw me
i let him think he was about to succeed gathered my forces and brought him crashing to the ground
the sword was in my hand and shortened the point was at his throat when my arm was jerked backwards
a moment and half a dozen hands had dragged me from the man beneath me and a supple savage had passed a thong of deerskin around my arms and pinioned them to my sides
the game was up there remained only to pay the forfeit without a grimace
diccon was not dead pinioned like myself and breathing hard he leaned sullenly against the wall they that he had slain at his feet
my lord rose and stood over against me
his rich doublet was torn and dragged away at the neck and my blood stained his hand and arm
a smile was upon the face that had made him master of a kingdom's master
the game was long he said but i have won at last
a long goodnight to you captain percy and a dreamless sleep  there was a swift backward movement of the indians and a loud the panther sir
have a care from diccon
i turned
the panther maddened by the noise and light the shifting figures the blocked doors the sight and smell of blood the blow that had been dealt it was crouching for a spring
the redbrown hair was bristling the eyes were terrible
i was before it but those glaring eyes had marked me not
it passed me like a bar from a catapult and the man whose heel it had felt was full in its path
one of its forefeet sank in the velvet of the doublet the claws of the other entered the flesh below the temple and tore downwards and across
with a cry as awful as the panther's scream the italian threw himself upon the beast and buried his poniard in its neck
the panther and the man it had attacked went down together
when the indians had unlocked that dread embrace and had thrust aside the dead brute there emerged from the dimness of the inner room master edward sharpless gray with fear trembling in every limb to take the reins that had fallen from my lord's hands
the king's minion lay in his blood a ghastly spectacle unconscious now but with life before himlife through which to pass a nightmare vision
the face out of which had looked that sullen proud and wicked spirit had been one of great beauty it had brought him exceeding wealth and power beyond measure the king had loved to look upon it and it had come to this
he lived and i was to die better my death than his life
in every heart there are dark depths whence at times ugly things creep into the daylight but at least i could drive back that unmanly triumph and bid it never come again
i would have killed him but i would not have had him thus
the italian was upon his knees beside his master even such a creature could love
from his skeleton throat came a low prolonged croaking sound and his bony hands strove to wipe away the blood
the paspaheghs drew around us closer and closer and the werowance clutched me by the shoulder
i shook him off
give the word sharpless i said or nod if thou art too frightened to speak
murder is too stern a stuff for such a base kitchen knave as thou to deal in  white and shaking he would not meet my eyes but beckoned the werowance to him and began to whisper vehemently pointing now to the man upon the floor now to the town now to the forest
the indian listened nodded and glided back to his fellows
the white men upon the powhatan are many he said in his own tongue but they build not their wigwams upon the banks of the pamunkey
 the singing birds of the pamunkey tell no tales
the pine splinters will burn as brightly there and the white men will smell them not
we will build a fire at uttamussac between the red hills before the temple and the graves of the kings there was a murmur of assent from his braves
uttamussac
they would probably make a two days' journey of it
we had that long then to live
captors and captives we presently left the hut
on the threshold i looked back past the poltroon whom i had flung into the river one midsummer day to that prone and bleeding figure
as i looked it groaned and moved
the indians behind me forced me on a moment and we were out beneath the stars
they shone so very brightly there was onelarge steadfast goldenjust over the dark town behind us over the governor's house
did she sleep or did she wake
sleeping or waking i prayed god to keep her safe and give her comfort
the stars now shone through naked branches black tree trunks hemmed us round and under our feet was the dreary rustling of dead leaves
the leafless trees gave way to pines and cedars and the closely woven scented roof hid the heavens and made a darkness of the world beneath

the modern york
chapter xxx in which we start upon a journey   when the dawn broke it found us traveling through a narrow valley beside a stream of some width
upon its banks grew trees of extraordinary height and girth cypress and oak and walnut they towered into the air their topmost branches stark and black against the roseate heavens
below that iron tracery glowed the firebrands of the maples and here and there a willow leaned a pale green cloud above the stream
mist closed the distances we could hear but not see the deer where they stood to drink in the shallow places or couched in the gray and dreamlike recesses of the forest
spectral unreal and hollow seems the world at dawn
then if ever the heart sickens and the will flags and life becomes a pageant that hath ceased to entertain
as i moved through the mist and the silence and felt the tug of the thong that bound me to the wrist of the savage who stalked before me i cared not how soon they made an end seeing how stale and unprofitable were all things under the sun
diccon walking behind me stumbled over a root and fell upon his knees dragging down with him the indian to whom he was tied
in a sudden access of fury aggravated by the jeers with which his fellows greeted his mishap the savage turned upon his prisoner and would have stuck a knife into him bound and helpless as he was had not the werowance interfered
the momentary altercation over and the knife restored to its owner's belt the indians relapsed into their usual menacing silence and the sullen march was resumed
presently the stream made a sharp bend across our path and we forded it as best we might
it ran dark and swift and the water was of icy coldness
beyond the woods had been burnt the trees rising from the red ground like charred and blackened stakes with the ghostlike mist between
we left this dismal tract behind and entered a wood of mighty oaks standing well apart and with the earth below carpeted with moss and early wild flowers
the sun rose the mist vanished and there set in the march day of keen wind and brilliant sunshine
farther on an indian bent his bow against a bear shambling across a little sunny glade
the arrow did its errand and where the creature fell there we sat down and feasted beside a fire kindled by rubbing two sticks together
according to their wont the indians ate ravenously and when the meal was ended began to smoke each warrior first throwing into the air as thankoffering to kiwassa a pinch of tobacco
they all stared at the fire around which we sat and the silence was unbroken
one by one as the pipes were smoked they laid themselves down upon the brown leaves and went to sleep only our two guardians and a third indian over against us remaining wideeyed and watchful
there was no hope of escape and we entertained no thought of it
diccon sat biting his nails staring into the fire and i stretched myself out and burying my head in my arms tried to sleep but could not
with the midday we were afoot again and we went steadily on through the bright afternoon
we met with no harsh treatment other than our bonds
instead when our captors spoke to us it was with words of amity and smiling lips
who accounteth for indian fashions
it is a way they have to flatter and caress the wretch for whom have been provided the torments of the damned
if when at sunset we halted for supper and gathered around the fire the werowance began to tell of a foray i had led against the paspaheghs years before and if he and his warriors for all the world like generous foes loudly applauded some daring that had accompanied that raid none the less did the red stake wait for us none the less would they strive as for heaven to wring from us groans and cries
the sun sank and the darkness entered the forest
in the distance we heard the wolves so the fire was kept up through the night
diccon and i were tied to trees and all the savages save one lay down and slept
i worked awhile at my bonds but an indian had tied them and after a time i desisted from the useless labor
we two could have no speech together the fire was between us and we saw each other but dimly through the flame and wreathing smokeas each might see the other tomorrow
what diccon's thoughts were i know not mine were not of the morrow
there had been no rain for a long time and the multitude of leaves underfoot were crisp and dry
the wind was loud in them and in the swaying trees
off in the forest was a bog and the willo'thewisps danced over itpale cold flames moving aimlessly here and there like ghosts of those lost in the woods
toward the middle of the night some heavy animal crashed through a thicket to the left of us and tore away into the darkness over the loudrustling leaves and later on wolves' eyes gleamed from out the ring of darkness beyond the firelight
far on in the night the wind fell and the moon rose changing the forest into some dim exquisite faroff land seen only in dreams
the indians awoke silently and all at once as at an appointed hour
they spoke for a while among themselves then we were loosed from the trees and the walk toward death began anew
on this march the werowance himself stalked beside me the moonlight whitening his dark limbs and relentless face
he spoke no word nor did i deign to question or reason or entreat
alike in the darkness of the deep woods and in the silver of the glades and in the long twilight stretches of sassafras and sighing grass there was for me but one vision
slender and still and white she moved before me with her wide dark eyes upon my face
jocelyn
jocelyn
at sunrise the mist lifted from a low hill before us and showed an indian boy painted white poised upon the summit like a spirit about to take its flight
he prayed to the one over all and his voice came down to us pure and earnest
at sight of us he bounded down the hillside like a ball and would have rushed away into the forest had not a paspahegh starting out of line seized him and set him in our midst where he stood cool and undismayed a warrior in miniature
he was of the pamunkeys and his tribe and the paspaheghs were at peace therefore when he saw the totem burnt upon the breast of the werowance he became loquacious enough and offered to go before us to his village upon the banks of a stream some bowshots away
he went and the paspaheghs rested under the trees until the old men of the village came forth to lead them through the brown fields and past the ring of leafless mulberries to the strangers' lodge
here on the green turf mats were laid for the visitors and water was brought for their hands
later on the women spread a great breakfast of fish and turkey and venison maize bread tuckahoe and pohickory
when it was eaten the paspaheghs ranged themselves in a semicircle upon the grass the pamunkeys faced them and each warrior and old man drew out his pipe and tobacco pouch
they smoked gravely in a silence broken only by an occasional slow and stately question or compliment
the blue incense from the pipes mingled with the sunshine falling freely through the bare branches the stream which ran by the lodge rippled and shone and the wind rose and fell in the pines upon its farther bank
diccon and i had been freed for the time from our bonds and placed in the centre of this ring and when the indians raised their eyes from the ground it was to gaze steadfastly at us
i knew their ways and how they valued pride indifference and a bravado disregard of the worst an enemy could do
they should not find the white man less proud than the savage
they gave us readily enough the pipes i asked for
diccon lit one and i the other and sitting side by side we smoked in a contentment as absolute as the indians' own
with his eyes upon the werowance diccon told an old story of a piece of paspahegh villainy and of the payment which the english exacted and i laughed as at the most amusing thing in the world
the story ended we smoked with serenity for a while then i drew my dice from my pocket and beginning to throw we were at once as much absorbed in the game as if there were no other stake in the world beside the remnant of gold that i piled between us
the strange people in whose power we found ourselves looked on with grim approval as at brave men who could laugh in death's face
the sun was high in the heavens when we bade the pamunkeys farewell
the cleared ground the mulberry trees and the grass beneath the few rude lodges with the curling smoke above them the warriors and women and brown naked childrenall vanished and the forest closed around us
a high wind was blowing and the branches far above beat at one another furiously while the pendent leafless vines swayed against us and the dead leaves went past in the whirlwind
a monstrous flight of pigeons crossed the heavens flying from west to east and darkening the land beneath like a transient cloud
we came to a plain covered with very tall trees that had one and all been ringed by the indians
long dead and partially stripped of the bark with their branches great and small squandered upon the ground they stood gaunt and silver gray ready for their fall
as we passed the wind brought two crashing to the earth
in the centre of the plain somethingdeer or wolf or bear or manlay dead for to that point the buzzards were sweeping from every quarter of the blue
beyond was a pine wood silent and dim with a high green roof and a smooth and scented floor
we walked through it for an hour and it led us to the pamunkey
a tiny village counting no more than a dozen warriors stood among the pines that ran to the water's edge and tied to the trees that shadowed the slowmoving flood were its canoes
when the people came forth to meet us the paspaheghs bought from them for a string of roanoke two of these boats and we made no tarrying but embarking at once rowed up river toward uttamussac and its three temples
diccon and i were placed in the same canoe
we were not bound what need of bonds when we had no friend nearer than the powhatan and when uttamussac was so near
after a time the paddles were put into our hands and we were required to row while our captors rested
there was no use in sulkiness we laughed as at some huge jest and bent to the task with a will that sent our canoe well in advance of its mate
diccon burst into an old song that we had sung in the low countries by camp fires on the march before the battle
the forest echoed to the loud and warlike tune and a multitude of birds rose startled from the trees upon the bank
the indians frowned and one in the boat behind called out to strike the singer upon the mouth but the werowance shook his head
there were none upon that river who might not know that the paspaheghs journeyed to uttamussac with prisoners in their midst
diccon sang on his head thrown back the old bold laugh in his eyes
when he came to the chorus i joined my voice to his and the woodland rang to the song
a psalm had better befitted our lips than those rude and vaunting words seeing that we should never sing again upon this earth but at least we sang bravely and gayly with minds that were reasonably quiet
the sun dropped low in the heavens and the trees cast shadows across the water
the paspaheghs now began to recount the entertainment they meant to offer us in the morning
all those tortures that they were wont to practice with hellish ingenuity they told over slowly and tauntingly watching to see a lip whiten or an eyelid quiver
they boasted that they would make women of us at the stake
at all events they made not women of us beforehand
we laughed as we rowed and diccon whistled to the leaping fish and the fishhawk and the otter lying along a fallen tree beneath the bank
the sunset came and the river lay beneath the colored clouds like molten gold with the gaunt forest black upon either hand
from the lifted paddles the water showered in golden drops
the wind died away and with it all noises and a dank stillness settled upon the flood and upon the endless forest
we were nearing uttamussac and the indians rowed quietly with bent heads and fearful glances for okee brooded over this place and he might be angry
it grew colder and stiller but the light dwelt in the heavens and was reflected in the bosom of the river
the trees upon the southern bank were all pines as if they had been carved from black stone they stood rigid against the saffron sky
presently back from the shore there rose before us a few small hills treeless but covered with some low dark growth
the one that stood the highest bore upon its crest three black houses shaped like coffins
behind them was the deep yellow of the sunset
an indian rowing in the second canoe commenced a chant or prayer to okee
the notes were low and broken unutterably wild and melancholy
one by one his fellows took up the strain it swelled higher louder and sterner became a deafening cry then ceased abruptly making the stillness that followed like death itself
both canoes swung round from the middle stream and made for the bank
when the boats had slipped from the stripe of gold into the inky shadow of the pines the paspaheghs began to divest themselves of this or that which they conceived okee might desire to possess
one flung into the stream a handful of copper links another the chaplet of feathers from his head a third a bracelet of blue beads
the werowance drew out the arrows from a gaudily painted and beaded quiver stuck them into his belt and dropped the quiver into the water
we landed dragging the canoes into a covert of overhanging bushes and fastening them there then struck through the pines toward the rising ground and presently came to a large village with many long huts and a great central lodge where dwelt the emperors when they came to uttamussac
it was vacant now opechancanough being no man knew where
when the usual stately welcome had been extended to the paspaheghs and when they had returned as stately thanks the werowance began a harangue for which i furnished the matter
when he ceased to speak a great acclamation and tumult arose and i thought they would scarce wait for the morrow
but it was late and their werowance and conjurer restrained them
in the end the men drew off and the yelling of the children and the passionate cries of the women importunate for vengeance were stilled
a guard was placed around the vacant lodge and we two englishmen were taken within and bound down to great logs such as the indians use to roll against their doors when they go from home
there was revelry in the village for hours after the night came everywhere were bright firelight and the rise and fall of laughter and song
the voices of the women were musical tender and plaintive and yet they waited for the morrow as for a gala day
i thought of a woman who used to sing softly and sweetly in the twilight at weyanoke in the firelight at the minister's house
at last the noises ceased the light died away and the village slept beneath a heaven that seemed somewhat deaf and blind
chapter xxxi in which nantauquas comes to our rescue   a man who hath been a soldier and an adventurer into far and strange countries must needs have faced death many times and in many guises
i had learned to know that grim countenance and to have no great fear of it
and beneath the ugliness of the mask that now presented itself there was only death at last
i was no babe to whimper at a sudden darkness to cry out against a curtain that a hand chose to drop between me and the life i had lived
death frighted me not but when i thought of one whom i should leave behind me i feared lest i should go mad
had this thing come to me a year before i could have slept the night through nownowi lay bound to the log before the open door of the lodge and looking through it saw the pines waving in the night wind and the gleam of the river beneath the stars and saw her as plainly as though she had stood there under the trees in a flood of noon sunshine
now she was the jocelyn percy of weyanoke now of the minister's house now of a stormtossed boat and a pirate ship now of the gaol at jamestown
one of my arms was free i could take from within my doublet the little purple flower and drop my face upon the hand that held it
the bloom was quite withered and scalding tears would not give it life again
the face that was now gay now defiant now pale and suffering became steadfastly the face that had leaned upon my breast in the jamestown gaol and looked at me with a mournful brightness of love and sorrow
spring was in the land and the summer would come but not to us
i stretched forth my hand to the wife who was not there and my heart lay crushed within me
she had been my wife not a year it was but the other day that i knew she loved me  after a while the anguish lessened and i lay dull and hopeless thinking of trifling things counting the stars between the pines
another slow hour and a braver mood coming upon me i thought of diccon who was in that plight because of me and spoke to him asking him how he did
he answered from the other side of the lodge but the words were scarcely out of his mouth before our guard broke in upon us commanding silence
diccon cursed them whereupon a savage struck him across the head with the handle of a tomahawk stunning him for a time
as soon as i heard him move i spoke again to know if he were much hurt when he had answered in the negative we said no more
it was now moonlight without the lodge and very quiet
the night was far gone already we could smell the morning and it would come apace
knowing the swiftness of that approach and what the early light would bring i strove for a courage which should be the steadfastness of the christian and not the vainglorious pride of the heathen
if my thoughts wandered if her face would come athwart the verses i tried to remember the prayer i tried to frame perhaps he who made her lovely understood and forgave
i said the prayer i used to say when i was a child and wished with all my heart for jeremy
suddenly in the first gray dawn as at a trumpet's call the village awoke
from the long communal houses poured forth men women and children fires sprang up dispersing the mist and a commotion arose through the length and breadth of the place
the women made haste with their cooking and bore maize cakes and broiled fish to the warriors who sat on the ground in front of the royal lodge
diccon and i were loosed brought without and allotted our share of the food
we ate sitting side by side with our captors and diccon with a great cut across his head seized the indian girl who brought him his platter of fish and pulling her down beside him kissed her soundly whereat the maid seemed not ill pleased and the warriors laughed
in the usual order of things the meal over tobacco should have followed
but now not a pipe was lit and the women made haste to take away the platters and to get all things in readiness
the werowance of the paspaheghs rose to his feet cast aside his mantle and began to speak
he was a man in the prime of life of a great figure strong as a susquehannock and a savage cruel and crafty beyond measure
over his breast stained with strange figures hung a chain of small bones and the scalp locks of his enemies fringed his moccasins
his tribe being the nearest to jamestown and in frequent altercation with us i had heard him speak many times and knew his power over the passions of his people
no player could be more skillful in gesture and expression no poet more nice in the choice of words no general more quick to raise a wild enthusiasm in the soldiers to whom he called
all indians are eloquent but this savage was a leader among them
he spoke now to some effect
commencing with a day in the moon of blossoms when for the first time winged canoes brought white men into the powhatan he came down through year after year to the present hour ceased and stood in silence regarding his triumph
it was complete
in its wild excitement the village was ready then and there to make an end of us who had sprung to our feet and stood with our backs against a great bay tree facing the maddened throng
so much the best for us would it be if the tomahawks left the hands that were drawn back to throw if the knives that were flourished in our faces should be buried to the haft in our hearts that we courted death striving with word and look to infuriate our executioners to the point of forgetting their former purpose in the lust for instant vengeance
it was not to be
the werowance spoke again pointing to the hills with the black houses upon them dimly seen through the mist
a moment and the hands clenched upon the weapons fell another and we were upon the march
as one man the village swept through the forest toward the rising ground that was but a few bowshots away
the young men bounded ahead to make preparation but the approved warriors and the old men went more sedately and with them walked diccon and i as steady of step as they
the women and children for the most part brought up the rear though a few impatient hags ran past us calling the men tortoises who would never reach the goal
one of these women bore a great burning torch the flame and smoke streaming over her shoulder as she ran
others carried pieces of bark heaped with the slivers of pine of which every wigwam has store
the sun was yet to rise when we reached a hollow amongst the low red hills
above us were the three long houses in which they keep the image of okee and the mummies of their kings
these temples faced the crimson east and the mist was yet about them
hideous priests painted over with strange devices the stuffed skins of snakes knotted about their heads in their hands great rattles which they shook vehemently rushed through the doors and down the bank to meet us and began to dance around us contorting their bodies throwing up their arms and making a hellish noise
diccon stared at them shrugged his shoulders and with a grunt of contempt sat down upon a fallen tree to watch the enemy's manoeuvres
the place was a natural amphitheatre well fitted for a spectacle
those indians who could not crowd into the narrow level spread themselves over the rising ground and looked down with fierce laughter upon the driving of the stakes which the young men brought
the women and children scattered into the woods beyond the cleft between the hills and returned bearing great armfuls of dry branches
the hollow rang to the exultation of the playgoers
taunting laughter cries of savage triumph the shaking of the rattles and the furious beating of two great drums combined to make a clamor deafening to stupor
and above the hollow was the angry reddening of the heavens and the white mist curling up like smoke
i sat down beside diccon on the log
beneath it there were growing tufts of a pale blue slenderstemmed flower
i plucked a handful of the blossoms and thought how blue they would look against the whiteness of her hand then dropped them in a sudden shame that in that hour i was so little steadfast to things which were not of earth
i did not speak to diccon nor he to me
there seemed no need of speech
in the pandemonium to which the world had narrowed the one familiar matterofcourse thing was that he and i were to die together
the stakes were in the ground and painted red the wood properly arranged
the indian woman who held the torch that was to light the pile ran past us whirling the wood around her head to make it blaze more fiercely
as she went by she lowered the brand and slowly dragged it across my wrists
the beating of the drums suddenly ceased and the loud voices died away
to indians no music is so sweet as the cry of an enemy if they have wrung it from a brave man who has striven to endure so much the better
they were very still now because they would not lose so much as a drawing in of the breath
seeing that they were coming for us diccon and i rose to await them
when they were nearly upon us i turned to him and held out my hand
he made no motion to take it
instead he stood with fixed eyes looking past me and slightly upwards
a sudden pallor had overspread the bronze of his face
there's a verse somewhere he said in a quiet voiceit's in the bible i thinki heard it once long ago before i was lost 'i will look unto the hills from whence cometh my help'look sir  i turned and followed with my eyes the pointing of his finger
in front of us the bank rose steeply bare to the summitno trees only the red earth with here and there a low growth of leafless bushes
behind it was the eastern sky
upon the crest against the sunrise stood the figure of a manan indian
from one shoulder hung an otterskin and a great bow was in his hand
his limbs were bare and as he stood motionless bathed in the rosy light he looked like some bronze god perfect from the beaded moccasins to the calm uneager face below the feathered headdress
he had but just risen above the brow of the hill the indians in the hollow saw him not
while diccon and i stared our tormentors were upon us
they came a dozen or more at once and we had no weapons
two hung upon my arms while a third laid hold of my doublet to rend it from me
an arrow whistled over our heads and stuck into a tree behind us
the hands that clutched me dropped and with a yell the busy throng turned their faces in the direction whence had come the arrow
the indian who had sent that dart before him was descending the bank
an instant's breathless hush while they stared at the solitary figure then the dark forms bent forward for the rush straightened and there arose a loud cry of recognition
the son of powhatan
the son of powhatan  he came down the hillside to the level of the hollow the authority of his look and gesture making way for him through the crowd that surged this way and that and walked up to us where we stood hemmed round but no longer in the clutch of our enemies
it was a very big wolf this time captain percy he said
you were never more welcome nantauquas i answeredunless indeed the wolf intends making a meal of three instead of two  he smiled
the wolf will go hungry today taking my hand in his he turned to his frowning countrymen
men of the pamunkeys he cried
this is nantauquas' friend and so the friend of all the tribes that called powhatan 'father'
the fire is not for him nor for his servant keep it for the monacans and for the dogs of the long house
the calumet is for the friend of nantauquas and the dance of the maidens the noblest buck and the best of the weirs  there was a surging forward of the indians and a fierce murmur of dissent
the werowance standing out from the throng lifted his voice
there was a time he cried when nantauquas was the panther crouched upon the bough above the leader of the herd now nantauquas is a tame panther and rolls at the white men's feet
there was a time when the word of the son of powhatan weighed more than the lives of many dogs such as these but now i know not why we should put out the fire at his command
he is war chief no longer for opechancanough will have no tame panther to lead the tribes
opechancanough is our head and opechancanough kindleth a fire indeed
we will give to this one what fuel we choose and tonight nantauquas may look for the bones of the white men  he ended and a great clamor arose
the paspaheghs would have cast themselves upon us again but for a sudden action of the young chief who had stood motionless with raised head and unmoved face during the werowance's bitter speech
now he flung up his hand and in it was a bracelet of gold carved and twisted like a coiled snake and set with a green stone
i had never seen the toy before but evidently others had done so
the excited voices fell and the indians pamunkeys and paspaheghs alike stood as though turned to stone
nantauquas smiled coldly
this day hath opechancanough made me war chief again
we have smoked the peace pipe togethermy father's brother and iin the starlight sitting before his lodge with the wide marshes and the river dark at our feet
singing birds in the forest have been many evil tales have they told opechancanough has stopped his ears against their false singing
my friends are his friends my brother is his brother my word is his word witness the armlet that hath no like that opechancanough brought with him when he came from no man knows where to the land of the powhatans many huskanawings ago that no white men but these have ever seen
opechancanough is at hand he comes through the forest with his two hundred warriors that are as tall as susquehannocks and as brave as the children of wahunsonacock
he comes to the temples to pray to kiwassa for a great hunting
will you when you lie at his feet that he ask you 'where is the friend of my friend of my war chief of the panther who is one with me again
'  there came a long deep breath from the indians then a silence in which they fell back slowly and sullenly whipped hounds but with the will to break that leash of fear
hark said nantauquas smiling
i hear opechancanough and his warriors coming over the leaves  the noise of many footsteps was indeed audible coming toward the hollow from the woods beyond
with a burst of cries the priests and the conjurer whirled away to bear the welcome of okee to the royal worshiper and at their heels went the chief men of the pamunkeys
the werowance of the paspaheghs was one that sailed with the wind he listened to the deepening sound and glanced at the son of powhatan where he stood calm and confident then smoothed his own countenance and made a most pacific speech in which all the blame of the late proceedings was laid upon the singing birds
when he had done speaking the young men tore the stakes from the earth and threw them into a thicket while the women plucked apart the newly kindled fire and flung the brands into a little nearby stream where they went out in a cloud of hissing steam
i turned to the indian who had wrought this miracle
art sure it is not a dream nantauquas i said
i think that opechancanough would not lift a finger to save me from all the deaths the tribes could invent  opechancanough is very wise he answered quietly
he says that now the english will believe in his love indeed when they see that he holds dear even one who might be called his enemy who hath spoken against him at the englishmen's council fire
he says that for five suns captain percy shall feast with opechancanough and that then he shall be sent back free to jamestown
he thinks that then captain percy will not speak against him any more calling his love to the white men only words with no good deeds behind  he spoke simply out of the nobility of his nature believing his own speech
i that was older and had more knowledge of men and the masks that they wear was but half deceived
my belief in the hatred of the dark emperor was not shaken and i looked yet to find the drop of poison within this honey flower
how poisoned was that bloom god knows i could not guess
when you were missed three suns ago nantauquas went on i and my brother tracked you to the hut beside the forest where we found only the dead panther
there we struck the trail of the paspaheghs but presently we came to running water and the trail was gone  we walked up the bed of the stream for half the night i said
the indian nodded
i know
my brother went back to jamestown for men and boats and guns to go to the paspahegh village and up the powhatan
he was wise with the wisdom of the white men but i who needed no gun and who would not fight against my own people i stepped into the stream and walked up it until past the full sun power
then i found a broken twig and the print of a moccasin half hidden by a bush overlooked when the other prints were smoothed away
i left the stream and followed the trail until it was broken again
i looked for it no more then for i knew that the paspaheghs had turned their faces toward uttamussac and that they would make a fire where many others had been made in the hollow below the three temples
instead i went with speed to seek opechancanough
yesterday when the sun was low i found him sitting in his lodge above the marshes and the colored river
we smoked the peace pipe together and i am his war chief again
i asked for the green stone that i might show it to the paspaheghs for a sign
he gave it but he willed to come to uttamussac with me  i owe you my life i said with my hand upon his
i and dicconwhat i would have said he put aside with a fine gesture
captain percy is my friend
my brother loves him and he was kind to matoax when she was brought prisoner to jamestown
i am glad that i could pull off this wolf  tell me one thing i asked
before you left jamestown had you heard aught of my wife or of my enemy  he shook his head
at sunrise the commander came to rouse my brother crying out that you had broken gaol and were nowhere to be found and that the man you hate was lying within the guest house sorely torn by some beast of the forest
my brother and i followed your trail at once the town was scarce awake when we left it behind usand i did not return  by this we three were alone in the hollow for all the savages men and women had gone forth to meet the indian whose word was law from the falls of the far west to the chesapeake
the sun now rode above the low hills pouring its gold into the hollow and brightening all the world besides
the little stream flashed diamonds and the carven devils upon the black houses above us were frightful no longer
there was not a menace anywhere from the cloudless skies to the sweet and plaintive chant to kiwassa sung by women and floating to us from the woods beyond the hollow
the singing grew nearer and the rustling of the leaves beneath many feet more loud and deep then all noise ceased and opechancanough entered the hollow alone
an eagle feather was thrust through his scalp lock over his naked breast that was neither painted nor pricked into strange figures hung a triple row of pearls his mantle was woven of bluebird feathers as soft and sleek as satin
the face of this barbarian was dark cold and impassive as death
behind that changeless mask as in a safe retreat the supersubtle devil that was the man might plot destruction and plan the laying of dreadful mines
he had dignity and courageno man denied him that
i suppose he thought that he and his had wrongs god knows
perhaps they had
but if ever we were hard or unjust in our dealings with the savagesi say not that this was the caseat least we were not treacherous and dealt not in judas kisses
i stepped forward and met him on the spot where the fire had been
for a minute neither spoke
it was true that i had striven against him many a time and i knew that he knew it
it was also true that without his aid nantauquas could not have rescued us from that dire peril
and it was again the truth that an indian neither forgives nor forgets
he was my saviour and i knew that mercy had been shown for some dark reason which i could not divine
yet i owed him thanks and gave them as shortly and simply as i could
he heard me out with neither liking nor disliking nor any other emotion written upon his face but when i had finished as though he suddenly bethought himself he smiled and held out his hand whiteman fashion
now when a man's lips widen i look into his eyes
the eyes of opechancanough were as fathomless as a pool at midnight and as devoid of mirth or friendliness as the staring orbs of the carven imps upon the temple corners
singing birds have lied to captain percy he said and his voice was like his eyes
opechancanough thinks that captain percy will never listen to them again
the chief of the powhatans is a lover of the white men of the english and of other white menif there are others
he would call the englishmen his brothers and be taught of them how to rule and who to pray to  let opechancanough go with me today to jamestown i said
he hath the wisdom of the woods let him come and gain that of the town  the emperor smiled again
i will come to jamestown soon but not today nor tomorrow nor the next day
and captain percy must smoke the peace pipe in my lodge above the pamunkey and watch my young men and maidens dance and eat with me five days
then he may go back to jamestown with presents for the great white father there and with a message that opechancanough is coming soon to learn of the white men  i could have gnashed my teeth at that delay when she must think me dead but it would have been the madness of folly to show the impatience which i felt
i too could smile with my lips when occasion drove and drink a bitter draught as though my soul delighted in it
blithe enough to all seeming and with as few inward misgivings as the case called for diccon and i went with the subtle emperor and the young chief he had bound to himself once more and with their fierce train back to that village which we had never thought to see again
a day and a night we stayed there then opechancanough sent away the paspaheghswhere we knew notand taking us with him went to his own village above the great marshes of the pamunkey
chapter xxxii in which we are the guests of an emperor   i had before this spent days among the indians on voyages of discovery as conqueror as negotiator for food exchanging blue beads for corn and turkeys
other englishmen had been with me
knowing those with whom we dealt for sly and fierce heathen friends today tomorrow deadly foes we kept our muskets ready and our eyes and ears open and what with the danger and the novelty and the bold wild life managed to extract some merriment as well as profit from these visits
it was different now
day after day i ate my heart out in that cursed village
the feasting and the hunting and the triumph the wild songs and wilder dances the fantastic mummeries the sudden rages the sudden laughter the great fires with their rings of painted warriors the sleepless sentinels the wide marshes that could not be crossed by night the leaves that rustled so loudly beneath the lightest footfall the monotonous days the endless nights when i thought of her grief of her peril maybeit was an evil dream and for my own pleasure i could not wake too soon
should we ever wake
should we not sink from that dream without pause into a deeper sleep whence there would be no waking
it was a question that i asked myself each morning half looking to find another hollow between the hills before the night should fall
the night fell and there was no change in the dream
i will allow that the dark emperor to whom we were so much beholden gave us courteous keeping
the best of the hunt was ours the noblest fish the most delicate roots
the skins beneath which we slept were fine and soft the women waited upon us and the old men and warriors held with us much stately converse sitting beneath the budding trees with the blue tobacco smoke curling above our heads
we were alive and sound of limb well treated and with the promise of release we might have waited seeing that wait we must in some measure of content
we did not so
there was a horror in the air
from the marshes that were growing green from the sluggish river from the rotting leaves and cold black earth and naked forest it rose like an exhalation
we knew not what it was but we breathed it in and it went to the marrow of our bones
opechancanough we rarely saw though we were bestowed so near to him that his sentinels served for ours
like some god he kept within his lodge with the winding passage and the hanging mats between him and the world without
at other times issuing from that retirement he would stride away into the forest
picked men went with him and they were gone for hours but when they returned they bore no trophies brute or human
what they did we could not guess
we might have had much comfort in nantauquas but the morning after our arrival in this village the emperor sent him upon an embassy to the rappahannocks and when for the fourth time the forest stood black against the sunset he had not returned
if escape had been possible we would not have awaited the doubtful fulfillment of that promise made to us below the uttamussac temples
but the vigilance of the indians never slept they watched us like hawks night and day
and the dry leaves underfoot would not hold their peace and there were the marshes to cross and the river
thus four days dragged themselves by and in the early morning of the fifth when we came from our wigwam it was to find nantauquas sitting by the fire magnificent in the paint and trappings of the ambassador motionless as a piece of bronze and apparently quite unmindful of the admiring glances of the women who knelt about the fire preparing our breakfast
when he saw us he rose and came to meet us and i embraced him i was so glad to see him
the rappahannocks feasted me long he said
i was afraid that captain percy would be gone to jamestown before i was back upon the pamunkey  shall i ever see jamestown again nantauquas i demanded
i have my doubts  he looked me full in the eyes and there was no doubting the candor of his own
you go with the next sunrise he answered
opechancanough has given me his word  i am glad to hear it i said
why have we been kept at all
why did he not free us five days agone  he shook his head
i do not know
opechancanough has many thoughts which he shares with no man
but now he will send you with presents for the governor and with messages of his love to the white men
there will be a great feast today and tonight the young men and maidens will dance before you
then in the morning you will go  will you not come with us i asked
you are ever welcome amongst us nantauquas both for your sister's sake and for your own
rolfe will rejoice to have you with him again he ever grudgeth you to the forest  he shook his head again
nantauquas the son of powhatan hath had much talk with himself lately he said simply
the white men's ways have seemed very good to him and the god of the white men he knows to be greater than okee and to be good and tender not like okee who sucks the blood of the children
he remembers matoax too and how she loved and cared for the white men and would weep when danger threatened them
and rolfe is his brother and his teacher
but opechancanough is his king and the red men are his people and the forest is his home
if because he loved rolfe and because the ways of the white men seemed to him better than his own ways he forgot these things he did wrong and the one over all frowns upon him
now he has come back to his home again to the forest and the hunting and the warpath to his king and his people
he will be again the panther crouching upon the bough  above the white men  he gazed at me in silence a shadow upon his face
above the monacans  he answered slowly
why did captain percy say 'above the white men'
opechancanough and the english have buried the hatchet forever and the smoke of the peace pipe will never fade from the air
nantauquas meant 'above the monacans or the long house dogs
'  i put my hand upon his shoulder
i know you did brother of rolfe by nature if not by blood
forget what i said it was without thought or meaning
if we go indeed tomorrow i shall be loath to leave you behind and yet were i in your place i should do as you are doing  the shadow left his face and he drew himself up
is it what you call faith and loyalty and like a knight he demanded with a touch of eagerness breaking through the slowness and gravity with which an indian speaks
yea i made reply
i think you good knight and true nantauquas and my friend moreover who saved my life  his smile was like his sister's quick and very bright and leaving behind it a most entire gravity
together we sat down by the fire and ate of the sylvan breakfast with shy brown maidens to serve us and with the sunshine streaming down upon us through the trees that were growing faintly green
it was a thing to smile at to see how the indian girls manoeuvred to give the choicest meat the most delicate maize cakes to the young war chief and to see how quietly he turned aside their benevolence
the meal over he went to divest himself of his red and white paint of the stuffed hawk and strings of copper that formed his headdress of his gorgeous belt and quiver and his mantle of raccoon skins while diccon and i sat still before our wigwam smoking and reckoning the distance to jamestown and the shortest time in which we could cover it
when we had sat there for an hour the old men and the warriors came to visit us and the smoking must commence all over again
the women laid mats in a great half circle and each savage took his seat with perfect breeding that is in absolute silence and with a face like a stone
the peace paint was upon them allred or red and white they sat and looked at the ground until i had made the speech of welcome
soon the air was dense with the fragrant smoke in the thick blue haze the sweep of painted figures had the seeming of some fantastic dream
an old man arose and made a long and touching speech with much reference to calumets and buried hatchets
when he had finished a chief talked of opechancanough's love for the english high as the stars deep as popogusso wide as from the sunrise to the sunset adding that the death of nemattanow last year and the troubles over the hunting grounds had kindled in the breasts of the indians no desire for revenge
with which highly probable statement he made an end and all sat in silence looking at me and waiting for my contribution of honeyed words
these pamunkeys living at a distance from the settlements had but little english to their credit and the learning of the paspaheghs was not much greater
i sat and repeated to them the better part of the seventh canto of the second book of master spenser's faery queen then i told them the story of the moor of venice and ended by relating smith's tale of the three turks' heads
it all answered the purpose to admiration
when at length they went away to change their paint for the coming feast diccon and i laughed at that foolery as though there were none beside us who could juggle with words
we were as lighthearted as childrengod forgive us
the day wore on with relay after relay of food which we must taste at least with endless smoking of pipes and speeches that must be listened to and answered
when evening came and our entertainers drew off to prepare for the dance they left us as wearied as by a long day's march
the wind had been high during the day but with the sunset it sank to a desolate murmur
the sky wore the strange crimson of the past year at weyanoke
against that sea of color the pines were drawn in ink and beneath it the winding threadlike creeks that pierced the marshes had the look of spilt blood moving slowly and heavily to join the river that was black where the pines shadowed it red where the light touched it
from the marsh arose the cry of some great bird that made its home there it had a lonely and a boding sound like a trumpet blown above the dead
the color died into an ashen gray and the air grew cold with a heaviness beside that dragged at the very soul
diccon shivered violently turned restlessly upon the log that served him as settle and began to mutter to himself
art cold i asked
he shook his head
something walked over my grave he said
i would give all the pohickory that was ever brewed by heathen for a toss of aqua vitae  in the centre of the village rose a great heap of logs and dry branches built during the day by the women and children
when the twilight fell and the owls began to hoot this pile was fired and lit the place from end to end
the scattered wigwams the scaffolding where the fish were dried the tall pines and widebranching mulberries the trodden grassall flashed into sight as the flame roared up to the topmost withered bough
the village glowed like a lamp set in the dead blackness of marsh and forest
opechancanough came from the forest with a score of warriors behind him and stopped beside me
i rose to greet him as was decent for he was an emperor albeit a savage and a pagan
tell the english that opechancanough grows old he said
the years that once were as light upon him as the dew upon the maize are now hailstones to beat him back to the earth whence he came
his arm is not swift to strike and strong as it once was
he is old the warpath and the scalp dance please him no longer
he would die at peace with all men
tell the english this tell them also that opechancanough knows that they are good and just that they do not treat men whose color is not their own like babes fooling them with toys thrusting them out of their path when they grow troublesome
the land is wide and the hunting grounds are many
let the red men who were here as many moons ago as there are leaves in summer and the white men who came yesterday dwell side by side in peace sharing the maize fields and the weirs and the hunting grounds together he waited not for my answer but passed on and there was no sign of age in his stately figure and his slow firm step
i watched him with a frown until the darkness of his lodge had swallowed up him and his warriors and mistrusted him for a cold and subtle devil
suddenly as we sat staring at the fire we were beset by a band of maidens coming out of the woods painted with antlers upon their heads and pine branches in their hands
they danced about us now advancing until the green needles met above our heads now retreating until there was a space of turf between us
their slender limbs gleamed in the firelight they moved with grace keeping time to a plaintive song now raised by the whole choir now fallen to a single voice
pocahontas had danced thus before the english many a time
i thought of the little maid of her great wondering eyes and her piteous untimely death of how loving she was to rolfe and how happy they had been in their brief wedded life
it had bloomed like a rose as fair and as early fallen with only a memory of past sweetness
death was a coward passing by men whose trade it was to outbrave him and striking at the young and lovely and innocent  we were tired with all the mummery of the day moreover every fibre of our souls had been strained to meet the hours that had passed since we left the gaol at jamestown
the elation we had felt earlier in the day was all gone
now the plaintive song the swaying figures the red light beating against the trees the blackness of the enshrouding forest the low melancholy windall things seemed strange and yet deadly old as though we had seen and heard them since the beginning of the world
all at once a fear fell upon me causeless and unreasonable but weighing upon my heart like a stone
she was in a palisaded town under the governor's protection with my friends about her and my enemy lying sick unable to harm her
it was i not she that was in danger
i laughed at myself but my heart was heavy and i was in a fever to be gone
the indian girls danced more and more swiftly and their song changed becoming gay and shrill and sweet
higher and higher rang the notes faster and faster moved the dark limbs then quite suddenly song and motion ceased together
they who had danced with the abandonment of wild priestesses to some wild god were again but shy brown indian maids who went and set them meekly down upon the grass beneath the trees
from the darkness now came a burst of savage cries only less appalling than the war whoop itself
in a moment the men of the village had rushed from the shadow of the trees into the broad firelit space before us
now they circled around us now around the fire now each man danced and stamped and muttered to himself
for the most part they were painted red but some were white from head to heelstatues come to lifewhile others had first oiled their bodies then plastered them over with small brightcolored feathers
the tall headdresses made giants of them all as they leaped and danced in the glare of the fire they had a fiendish look
they sang too but the air was rude and broken by dreadful cries
out of a hut behind us burst two or three priests the conjurer and a score or more of old men
they had indian drums upon which they beat furiously and long pipes made of reeds which gave forth no uncertain sound
fixed upon a pole and borne high above them was the image of their okee a hideous thing of stuffed skins and rattling chains of copper
when they had joined themselves to the throng in the firelight the clamor became deafening
some one piled on more logs and the place grew light as day
opechancanough was not there nor nantauquas
diccon and i watched that uncouth spectacle that virginian masque as we had watched many another one with disgust and weariness
it would last we knew for the better part of the night
it was in our honor and for a while we must stay and testify our pleasure but after a time when they had sung and danced themselves into oblivion of our presence we might retire and leave the very old men the women and the children sole spectators
we waited for that relief with impatience though we showed it not to those who pressed about us
time passed and the noise deepened and the dancing became more frantic
the dancers struck at one another as they leaped and whirled the sweat rolled from their bodies and from their lips came hoarse animallike cries
the fire ever freshly fed roared and crackled mocking the silent stars
the pines were bronzered the woods beyond a dead black
all noises of marsh and forest were lost in the scream of the pipes the wild yelling and the beating of the drums
from the ranks of the women beneath the reddened pines rose shrill laughter and applause as they sat or knelt bent forward watching the dancers
one girl alone watched not them but us
she stood somewhat back of her companions one slim brown hand touching the trunk of a tree one brown foot advanced her attitude that of one who waits but for a signal to be gone
now and then she glanced impatiently at the wheeling figures or at the old men and the few warriors who took no part in the masque but her eyes always came back to us
she had been among the maidens who danced before us earlier in the night when they rested beneath the trees she had gone away and the night was much older when i marked her again coming out of the firelit distance back to the fire and her dusky mates
it was soon after this that i became aware that she must have some reason for her anxious scrutiny some message to deliver or warning to give
once when i made a slight motion as if to go to her she shook her head and laid her finger upon her lips
a dancer fell from sheer exhaustion another and another and warriors from the dozen or more seated at our right began to take the places of the fallen
the priests shook their rattles and made themselves dizzy with bending and whirling about their okee the old men too though they sat like statues thought only of the dance and of how they themselves had excelled long ago when they were young
i rose and making my way to the werowance of the village where he sat with his eyes fixed upon a young indian his son who bade fair to outlast all others in that wild contest told him that i was wearied and would go to my hut i and my servant to rest for the few hours that yet remained of the night
he listened dreamily his eyes upon the dancing indian but made offer to escort me thither
i pointed out to him that my quarters were not fifty yards away in the broad firelight in sight of them all and that it were a pity to take him or any others from the contemplation of that whirling indian so strong and so brave that he would surely one day lead the war parties
after a moment he acquiesced and diccon and i quietly and yet with some ostentation so as to avoid all appearance of stealing away left the press of savages and began to cross the firelit turf between them and our lodge
when we had gone fifty paces i glanced over my shoulder and saw that the indian maid no longer stood where we had last seen her beneath the pines
a little farther on we caught a glimpse of her winding in and out among a row of trees to our left
the trees ran past our lodge
when we had reached its entrance we paused and looked back to the throng we had left
every back seemed turned to us every eye intent upon the leaping figures around the great fire
swiftly and quietly we walked across the bit of even ground to the friendly trees and found ourselves in a thin strip of shadow between the light of the great fire we had left and that of a lesser one burning redly before the emperor's lodge
beneath the trees waiting for us was the indian maid with her light form and large shy eyes and finger upon her lips
she would not speak or tarry but flitted before us as dusk and noiseless as a moth and we followed her into the darkness beyond the firelight wellnigh to the line of sentinels
a wigwam larger than common and shadowed by trees rose in our path the girl gliding in front of us held aside the mats that curtained the entrance
we hesitated a moment then stooped and entered the place
chapter xxxiii in which my friend becomes my foe   in the centre of the wigwam the customary fire burned clear and bright showing the white mats the dressed skins the implements of war hanging upon the bark wallsall the usual furniture of an indian dwellingand showing also nantauquas standing against the stripped trunk of a pine that pierced the wigwam from floor to roof
the fire was between us
he stood so rigid at his full height with folded arms and head held high and his features were so blank and still so forced and frozen as it were into composure that with the red light beating upon him and the thin smoke curling above his head he had the look of a warrior tied to the stake
nantauquas i exclaimed and striding past the fire would have touched him but that with a slight and authoritative motion of the hand he kept me back
otherwise there was no change in his position or in the dead calm of his face
the indian maid had dropped the mat at the entrance and if she waited waited without in the darkness
diccon now staring at the young chief now eyeing the weapons upon the wall with all a lover's passion kept near the doorway
through the thickness of the bark and woven twigs the wild cries and singing came to us somewhat faintly beneath that distant noise could be heard the wind in the trees and the soft fall of the burning pine
well i asked at last
what is the matter my friend  for a full minute he made no answer and when he did speak his voice matched his face
my friend he said i am going to show myself a friend indeed to the english to the strangers who were not content with their own hunting grounds beyond the great salt water
when i have done this i do not know that captain percy will call me 'friend' again  you were wont to speak plainly nantauquas i answered him
i am not fond of riddles  again he waited as though he found speech difficult
i stared at him in amazement he was so changed in so short a time
he spoke at last when the dance is over and the fires are low and the sunrise is at hand then will opechancanough come to you to bid you farewell
he will give you the pearls that he wears about his neck for a present to the governor and a bracelet for yourself
also he will give you three men for a guard through the forest
he has messages of love to send the white men and he would send them by you who were his enemy and his captive
so all the white men shall believe in his love  well i said dryly as he paused
i will take his messages
what next  those are the words of opechancanough
now listen to the words of nantauquas the son of wahunsonacock a war chief of the powhatans
there are two sharp knives there hanging beneath the bow and the quiver and the shield
take them and hide them  the words were scarcely out of his mouth before diccon had the two keen english blades
i took the one he offered me and hid it in my doublet
so we go armed nantauquas i said
love and peace and goodwill consort not with such toys  you may want them he went on with no change in his low measured tones
if you see aught in the forest that you should not see if they think you know more than you are meant to know then those three who have knives and tomahawks are to kill you whom they believe unarmed  see aught that we should not see know more than we are meant to know  i said
to the point friend  they will go slowly too through the forest to jamestown stopping to eat and to sleep
for them there is no need to run like the stag with the hunter behind him  then we should make for jamestown as for life i said not sleeping or eating or making pause  yea he replied if you would not die you and all your people  in the silence of the hut the fire crackled and the branches of the trees outside bent by the wind made a grating sound against the bark roof
how die i asked at last
speak out  die by the arrow and the tomahawk he answeredyea and by the guns you have given the red men
tomorrow's sun and the next and the nextthree sunsand the tribes will fall upon the english
at the same hour when the men are in the fields and the women and children are in the houses they will strikekecoughtans paspaheghs chickahominies pamunkeys arrowhatocks chesapeakes nansemonds accomacsas one man will they strike and from where the powhatan falls over the rocks to the salt water beyond accomac there will not be one white man left alive  he ceased to speak and for a minute the fire made the only sound in the hut
then all die i asked dully
there are three thousand englishmen in virginia  they are scattered and unwarned
the fighting men of the villages of the powhatan and the pamunkey and the great bay are many and they have sharpened their hatchets and filled their quivers with arrows  scattered i said strewn broadcast up and down the riverhere a lonely house there a cluster of two or three they at jamestown and henricus off guardthe men in the fields or at the wharves the women and the children busy within doors all unwarnedo my god  diccon strode over from the doorway to the fire
we'd best be going i reckon sir he cried
or you wait until morning then there'll be two chances
now that i've a knife i'm thinking i can give account of one of them damned sentries at least
once clear of them  i shook my head and the indian too made a gesture of dissent
you would only be the first to die  i leaned against the side of the hut for my heart beat like a frightened woman's
three days i exclaimed
if we go with all our speed we shall be in time
when did you learn this thing  while you watched the dance he answered opechancanough and i sat within his lodge in the darkness
his heart was moved and he talked to me of his own youth in a strange country south of the sunset where he and his people dwelt in stone houses and worshiped a great and fierce god giving him blood to drink and flesh to eat
to that country too white men had come in ships
then he spoke to me of powhatan my fatherof how wise he was and how great a chief before the english came and how the english made him kneel in sign that he held his lands from their king and how he hated them and then he told me that the tribes had called me 'woman' 'lover no longer of the warpath and the scalp dance' but that he who had no son loved me as his son knowing my heart to be indian still and then i heard what i have told you  how long had this been planned  for many moons
i have been a child fooled and turned aside from the trail not wise enough to see it beneath the flowers through the smoke of the peace pipes  why does opechancanough send us back to the settlements i demanded
their faith in him needs no strengthening  it is his fancy
every hunter and trader and learner of our tongues living in the villages or straying in the woods has been sent back to jamestown or to his hundred with presents and with words that are sweeter than honey
he has told the three who go with you the hour in which you are to reach jamestown he would have you as singing birds telling lying tales to the governor with scarce the smoking of a pipe between those words of peace and the war whoop
but if those who go with you see reason to misdoubt you they will kill you in the forest  his voice fell and he stood in silence straight as an arrow against the post the firelight playing over his dark limbs and sternly quiet face
outside the night wind rising began to howl through the naked branches and a louder burst of yells came to us from the roisterers in the distance
the mat before the doorway shook and a slim brown hand slipped between the wood and the woven grass beckoned to us
why did you come demanded the indian
long ago when there were none but dark men from the chesapeake to the hunting grounds beneath the sunset we were happy
why did you leave your own land in the strange black ships with sails like the piledup clouds of summer
was it not a good land
were not your forests broad and green your fields fruitful your rivers deep and filled with fish
and the towns i have heard ofwere they not fair
you are brave men had you no enemies there and no warpaths
it was your home a man should love the good earth over which he hunts upon which stands his village
this is the red man's land
he wishes his hunting grounds his maize fields and his rivers for himself his women and children
he has no ships in which to go to another country
when you first came we thought you were gods but you have not done like the great white god who you say loves you so
you are wiser and stronger than we but your strength and wisdom help us not they press us down from men to children they are weights upon the head and shoulders of a babe to keep him under stature
ill gifts have you brought us evil have you wrought us  not to you nantauquas i cried stung into speech
he turned his eyes upon me
nantauquas is the war chief of his tribe
opechancanough is his king and he lies upon his bed in his lodge and says within himself 'my war chief the panther the son of wahunsonacock who was chief of all the powhatans sits now within his wigwam sharpening flints for his arrows making his tomahawk bright and keen thinking of a day three suns hence when the tribes will shake off forever the hand upon their shoulderthe hand so heavy and white that strives always to bend them to the earth and keep them there'
tell me you englishman who have led in war another name for nantauquas and ask no more what evil you have done him  i will not call you 'traitor' nantauquas i said after a pause
there is a difference
you are not the first child of powhatan who has loved and shielded the white men  she was a woman a child he answered
out of pity she saved your lives not knowing that it was to the hurt of her people
then you were few and weak and could not take your revenge
now if you die not you will drink deep of vengeanceso deep that your lips may never leave the cup
more ships will come and more you will grow ever stronger
there may come a moon when the deep forests and the shining rivers know us to whom kiwassa gave them no more he paused with unmoved face and eyes that seemed to pierce the wall and look out into unfathomable distances
go he said at last
if you die not in the woods if you see again the man whom i called my brother and teacher tell him
 tell him nothing
go  come with us urged diccon gruffly
we english will make a place for you among usand got no further for i turned upon him with a stern command for silence
i ask of you no such thing nantauquas i said
come against us if you will
nobly warned fair upon our guard we will meet you as knightly foe should be met  he stood for a minute the quick change that had come into his face at diccon's blundering words gone and his features sternly impassive again then very slowly he raised his arm from his side and held out his hand
his eyes met mine in sombre inquiry half eager half proudly doubtful
i went to him at once and took his hand in mine
no word was spoken
presently he withdrew his hand from my clasp and putting his finger to his lips whistled low to the indian girl
she drew aside the hanging mats and we passed out diccon and i leaving him standing as we had found him upright against the post in the red firelight
should we ever go through the woods pass through that gathering storm reach jamestown warn them there of the death that was rushing upon them
should we ever leave that hated village
would the morning ever come
when we reached our hut unseen and sat down just within the doorway to watch for the dawn it seemed as though the stars would never pale
again and again the leaping indians between us and the fire fed the tall flame if one figure fell in the wild dancing another took its place the yelling never ceased nor the beating of the drums
it was an alarum that was sounding and there were only two to hear miles away beneath the mute stars english men and women lay asleep with the hour thundering at their gates and there was none to cry awake  when would the dawn come when should we be gone
i could have cried out in that agony of waiting with the leagues on leagues to be traveled and the time so short
if we never reached those sleepersi saw the dark warriors gathering tribe on tribe war party on war party thick crowding shadows of death slipping though the silent forest and the clearings we had made and the houses we had built the goodly englishmen kent and thorpe and yeardley maddison wynne hamor the men who had striven to win and hold this land so fatal and so fair west and rolfe and jeremy sparrow the children about the doorsteps the women one woman
it came to an end as all things earthly will
the flames of the great bonfire sank lower and lower and as they sank the gray light faltered into being grew and strengthened
at last the dancers were still the women scattered the priests with their hideous okee gone
the wailing of the pipes died away the drums ceased to beat and the village lay in the keen wind and the pale light inert and quiet with the stillness of exhaustion
the pause and hush did not last
when the ruffled pools amid the marshes were rosy beneath the sunrise the women brought us food and the warriors and old men gathered about us
they sat upon mats or billets of wood and i offered them bread and meat and told them they must come to jamestown to taste of the white man's cookery
scarcely was the meal over when opechancanough issued from his lodge with his picked men behind him and coming slowly up to us took his seat upon the white mat that was spread for him
for a few minutes he sat in a silence that neither we nor his people cared to break
only the wind sang in the brown branches and from some forest brake came a stag's hoarse cry
as he sat in the sunshine he glistened all over like an ethiop besprent with silver for his dark limbs and mighty chest had been oiled and then powdered with antimony
through his scalp lock was stuck an eagle's feather across his face from temple to chin was a bar of red paint the eyes above were very bright and watchful but we upon whom that scrutiny was bent were as little wont as he to let our faces tell our minds
one of his young men brought a great pipe carved and painted stem and bowl an old man filled it with tobacco and a warrior lit it and bore it to the emperor
he put it to his lips and smoked in silence while the sun climbed higher and higher and the golden minutes that were more precious than heart's blood went by at once too slow too swift
at last his part in the solemn mockery played he held out the pipe to me
the sky will fall and the rivers run dry and the birds cease to sing he said before the smoke of the calumet fades from the land  i took the symbol of peace and smoked it as silently and soberlyay and as slowlyas he had done before me then laid it leisurely aside and held out my hand
my eyes have been holden i told him but now i see plainly the deep graves of the hatchets and the drifting of the peace smoke through the forest
let opechancanough come to jamestown to smoke of the englishman's uppowoc and to receive rich presentsa red robe like his brother powhatan's and a cup from which he shall drink he and all his people  he laid his dark fingers in mine for an instant withdrew them and rising to his feet motioned to three indians who stood out from the throng of warriors
these are captain percy's guides and friends  he announced
the sun is high it is time that he was gone
here are presents for him and for my brother the governor as he spoke he took from his neck the rope of pearls and from his arm a copper bracelet and laid both upon my palm
i thrust the pearls within my doublet and slipped the bracelet upon my wrist
thanks opechancanough i said briefly
when we meet again i shall not greet you with empty thanks  by this all the folk of the village had gathered around us and now the drums beat again and the maidens raised a wild and plaintive song of farewell
at a sign from the werowance men and women formed a rude procession and followed us who were to go upon a journey to the edge of the village where the marsh began
only the dark emperor and the old men stayed behind sitting and standing in the sunshine with the peace pipe lying on the grass at their feet and the wind moving the branches overhead
i looked back and saw them thus and wondered idly how many minutes they would wait before putting on the black paint
of nantauquas we had seen nothing
either he had gone to the forest or upon some pretense he kept within his lodge
we bade farewell to the noisy throng who had brought us upon our way and went down to the river where we found a canoe and rowers crossed the stream and bidding the rowers goodby entered the forest
it was wednesday morning and the sun was two hours high
three suns nantauquas had said on friday then the blow would fall
three days
once at jamestown it would take three days to warn each lonely scattered settlement to put the colony into any posture of defense
what of the leagues of dangerhaunted forest to be traversed before even a single soul of the three thousand could be warned
as for the three indianswho had their orders to go slowly who at any suspicious haste or question or anxiety on our part were to kill us whom they deemed unarmedwhen they left their village that morning they left it forever
there were times when diccon and i had no need of speech but knew each other's mind without so now though no word had been spoken we were agreed to set upon and slay our guides the first occasion that offered
chapter xxxiv in which the race is not to the swift   the three indians of whom we must rid ourselves were approved warriors fierce as wolves cunning as foxes keeneyed as hawks
they had no reason to doubt us to dream that we would turn upon them but from habit they watched us with tomahawk and knife resting lightly in their belts
as for us we walked slowly smiled freely and spoke frankly
the sunshine streaming down in the spaces where the trees fell away was not brighter than our mood
had we not smoked the peace pipe
were we not on our way home
diccon walking behind me fell into a lowvoiced conversation with the savage who strode beside him
it related to the barter for a dozen otterskins of a gun which he had at jamestown
the savage was to bring the skins to paspahegh at his earliest convenience and diccon would meet him there and give him the gun provided the pelts were to his liking
as they talked each in his mind's eye saw the other dead before him
the one meant to possess a gun indeed but he thought to take it himself from the munition house at jamestown the other knew that the otter which died not until this indian's arrow quivered in its side would live until doomsday
yet they discussed the matter gravely hedging themselves about with provisos and the bargain clinched walked on side by side in the silence of a perfect and allcomprehending amity
the sun rode higher and higher gilding the misty green of the budding trees quickening the red maple bloom into fierce scarlet throwing lances of light down through the pine branches to splinter against the dark earth far below
for an hour it shone then clouds gathered and shut it from sight
the forest darkened and the wind arose with a shriek
the young trees cowered before the blast the strong and vigorous beat their branches together with a groaning sound the old and worn fell crashing to the earth
presently the rain rushed down slant lines of silver tearing through the wood with the sound of the feet of an army hail followed a torrent of ice beating and bruising all tender green things to the earth
the wind took the multitudinous soundsthe cries of frightened birds the creaking trees the snap of breaking boughs the crash of falling giants the rush of the rain the drumming of the hailenwound them with itself and made the forest like a great shell held close to the ear
there was no house to flee to so long as we could face the hail we staggered on heads down buffeting the wind but at last the fury of the storm increasing we were fain to throw ourselves upon the earth in a little brake where an overhanging bank somewhat broke the wind
a mighty oak swaying and groaning above us might fall and crush us like eggshells but if we went on the like fate might meet us in the way
broken and withered limbs driven by the wind went past us like crooked shadows it grew darker and darker and the air was deadly cold
the three indians pressed their faces against the ground they dreamed not of harm from us but okee was in the merciless hail and the first thunder of the year now pealing through the wood
suddenly diccon raised himself upon his elbow and looked across at me
our eyes had no sooner met than his hand was at his bosom
the savage nearest him feeling the movement as it were lifted his head from the earth of which it was so soon to become a part but if he saw the knife he saw it too late
the blade driven down with all the strength of a desperate man struck home when it was drawn from its sheath of flesh there remained to us but a foe apiece
in the instant of its descent i had thrown myself upon the indian nearest me
it was not a time for overniceness
if i could have done so i would have struck him in the back while he thought no harm as it was some subtle instinct warning him he whirled himself over in time to strike up my hand and to clench with me
he was very strong and his naked body wet with rain slipped like a snake from my hold
over and over we rolled on the rainsoaked moss and rotted leaves and cold black earth the hail blinding us and the wind shrieking like a thousand watching demons
he strove to reach the knife within his belt i to prevent him and to strike deep with the knife i yet held
at last i did so
blood gushed over my hand and wrist the clutch upon my arm relaxed the head fell back
the dying eyes glared into mine then the lids shut forever upon that unquenchable hatred
i staggered to my feet and turned to find that diccon had given account of the third indian
we stood up in the hail and the wind and looked at the dead men at our feet
then without speaking we went our way through the tossing forest with the hailstones coming thick against us and the wind a strong hand to push us back
when we came to a little trickling spring we knelt and washed our hands
the hail ceased but the rain fell and the wind blew throughout the morning
we made what speed we could over the boggy earth against the storm but we knew that we were measuring miles where we should have measured leagues
there was no breath to waste in words and thought was a burden quite intolerable it was enough to stumble on through the partial light with a mind as gray and blank as the rainblurred distance
at noon the clouds broke and an hour later the sunshine was streaming down from a cloudless heaven beneath which the forest lay clear before us naught stirring save shy sylvan creatures to whom it mattered not if red man or white held the land
side by side diccon and i hurried on not speaking keeping eye and ear open proposing with all our will to reach the goal we had set and to reach it in time let what might oppose
it was but another forced march many had we made in our time through dangers manifold and had lived to tell the tale
there was no leisure in which to play the indian and cover up our footprints as we made them but when we came to a brook we stepped into the cold swiftflowing water and kept it company for a while
the brook flowed between willows thickly set already green and overarching a yard or more of water
presently it bent sharply and we turned with it
ten yards in front of us the growth of willows ceased abruptly the low steep banks shelved downwards to a grassy level and the stream widened into a clear and placid pool as blue as the sky above
crouched upon the grass or standing in the shallow water were some fifteen or twenty deer
we had come upon them without noise the wind blew from them to us and the willows hid us from their sight
there was no alarm and we stood a moment watching them before we should throw a stone or branch into their midst and scare them from our path
suddenly as we looked the leader threw up his head made a spring and was off like a dart across the stream and into the depths of the forest beyond
the herd followed
a moment and there were only the trodden grass and the troubled waters no other sign that aught living had passed that way
now what was that for muttered diccon
i'm thinking we had best not take to the open just yet  for answer i parted the willows and forced myself into the covert pressing as closely as possible against the bank and motioning him to do the same
he obeyed and the thickclustering goldgreen twigs swung into place again shutting us in with the black water and the leafy crumbling bank
from that green dimness we could look out upon the pool and the grass with small fear that we ourselves would be seen
out of the shadow of the trees into the grassy space stepped an indian a second followed a third a fourthone by one they came from the gloom into the sunlight until we had counted a score or more
they made no pause a glance telling them to what were due the trampled grass and the muddied water
as they crossed the stream one stooped and drank from his hand but they said no word and made no noise
all were painted black a few had face and chest striped with yellow
their headdresses were tall and wonderful their leggings and moccasins fringed with scalp locks their hatchets glinted in the sunshine and their quivers were stuck full of arrows
one by one they glided from the stream into the thick woods beyond
we waited until we knew that they were were deep in the forest then crept from the willows and went our way
they were youghtenunds i said in the low tones we used when we spoke at all and they went to the southward  we may thank our stars that they missed our trail diccon answered
we spoke no more but leaving the stream struck again toward the south
the day wore on and still we went without pause
sun and shade and keen wind long stretches of pine and open glades where we quickened our pace to a run dense woods snares of leafless vines swamp and thicket through which we toiled so slowly that the heart bled at the delay streams and fallen treeson and on we hurried until the sun sank and the dusk came creeping in upon us
we've dined with duke humphrey today said diccon at last but if we can keep this pace and don't meet any more war parties or fall foul of an indian village or have to fight the wolves tonight we'll dine with the governor tomorrow
what's that  that was the report of a musket and a spent ball had struck me above the knee bruising the flesh beneath the leather of my boot
we wheeled and looked in the direction whence lead come that unwelcome visitor
there was naught to be seen
it was dusk in the distance and there were thickets too and fallen logs
where that ambuscade was planted if one or twenty indians lurked in the dusk behind the trees or lay on the further side of those logs or crouched within a thicket no mortal man could tell
it was a spent ball i said
our best hope is in our heels  there are pines beyond and smooth going he answered but if ever i thought to run from an indian  without more ado we started
if we could outstrip that marksman if we could even hold our distance until night had fallen all might yet be well
a little longer and even an indian must fire at random moreover we might reach some stream and manage to break our trail
the ground was smooth before ustoo smooth and slippery with pine needles the pines themselves stood in grim brown rows and we ran between them lightly and easily husbanding our strength
now and again one or the other looked behind but we saw only the pines and the gathering dusk
hope was strengthening in us when a second bullet dug into the earth just beyond us
diccon swore beneath his breath
it struck deep he muttered
the dark is slow in coming  a minute later as i ran with my head over my shoulder i saw our pursuer dimly like a deeper shadow in the shadows far down the arcade behind us
there was but one mana tall warrior strayed aside from his band perhaps or bound upon a warpath of his own
the musket that he carried some english fool had sold him for a mess of pottage
putting forth all our strength we ran for our lives and for the lives of many others
before us the pine wood sloped down to a deep and wide thicket and beyond the thicket a line of sycamores promised water
if we could reach the thicket its close embrace would hide usthen the darkness and the stream
a third shot and diccon staggered slightly
for god's sake not struck man i cried
it grazed my arm he panted
no harm done
here's the thicket  into the dense growth we broke reckless of the blood which the sharp twigs drew from face and hands
the twigs met in a thick roof over our heads that was all we cared for and through the network we saw one of the larger stars brighten into being
the thicket was many yards across
when we had gone thirty feet down we crouched and waited for the dark
if our enemy followed us he must do so at his peril with only his knife for dependence
one by one the stars swam into sight until the square of sky above us was thickly studded
there was no sound and no living thing could have entered that thicket without noise
for what seemed an eternity we waited then we rose and broke our way through the bushes to the sycamores to find that they indeed shadowed a little sluggish stream
down this we waded for some distance before taking to dry earth again
since entering the thicket we had seen and heard nothing suspicious and were now fain to conclude that the dark warrior had wearied of the chase and was gone on his way toward his mates and that larger and surer quarry which two suns would bring
certain it is that we saw no more of him
the stream flowing to the south we went with it hurrying along its bank beneath the shadow of great trees with the stars gleaming down through the branches
it was cold and still and far in the distance we heard wolves hunting
as for me i felt no weariness
every sense was sharpened my feet were light the keen air was like wine in the drinking there was a star low in the south that shone and beckoned
the leagues between my wife and me were few
i saw her standing beneath the star with a little purple flower in her hand
suddenly a bend in the stream hiding the star i became aware that diccon was no longer keeping step with me but had fallen somewhat to the rear
i turned and he was leaning heavily with drooping head against the trunk of a tree
art so worn as that i exclaimed
put more heart into thy heels man  he straightened himself and strode on beside me
i don't know what came over me for a minute he answered
the wolves are loud tonight
i hope they'll keep to their side of the water  a stone's throw farther on the stream curving to the west we left it and found ourselves in a sparsely wooded glade with a bare and sandy soil beneath our feet and above in the western sky a crescent moon
again diccon lagged behind and presently i heard him groan in the darkness
i wheeled
diccon i cried
what is the matter  before i could reach him he had sunk to his knees
when i put my hand upon his arm and again demanded what ailed him he tried to laugh then tried to swear and ended with another groan
the ball did graze my arm he said but it went on into my side
i'll just lie here and die and wish you well at jamestown
when the red imps come against you there and you open fire on them name a bullet for me    chapter xxxv in which i come to the governor's house   i laid him down upon the earth and cutting away his doublet and the shirt beneath saw the wound and knew that there was a journey indeed that he would shortly make
the world is turning round he muttered and the stars are falling thicker than the hailstones yesterday
go on and i will stay behindi and the wolves  i took him in my arms and carried him back to the bank of the stream for i knew that he would want water until he died
my head was bare but he had worn his cap from the gaol at jamestown that night
i filled it with water and gave him to drink then washed the wound and did what i could to stanch the bleeding
he turned from side to side and presently his mind began to wander and he talked of the tobacco in the fields at weyanoke
soon he was raving of old things old camp fires and nighttime marches and wild skirmishes perils by land and by sea then of dice and wine and women
once he cried out that dale had bound him upon the wheel and that his arms and legs were broken and the woods rang to his screams
why in that wakeful forest they were unheard or why if heard they went unheeded god only knows
the moon went down and it was very cold
how black were the shadows around us what foes might steal from that darkness upon us it was not worth while to consider
i do not know what i thought of on that night or even that i thought at all
between my journeys for the water that he called for i sat beside the dying man with my hand upon his breast for he was quieter so
now and then i spoke to him but he answered not
hours before we had heard the howling of wolves and knew that some ravenous pack was abroad
with the setting of the moon the noise had ceased and i thought that the brutes had pulled down the deer they hunted or else had gone with their hunger and their dismal voices out of earshot
suddenly the howling recommenced at first faint and far away then nearer and nearer yet
earlier in the evening the stream had been between us but now the wolves had crossed and were coming down our side of the water and were coming fast
all the ground was strewn with dead wood and near by was a growth of low and brittle bushes
i gathered the withered branches and broke fagots from the bushes then into the press of dark and stealthy forms i threw a great crooked stick shouting as i did so and threatening with my arms
they turned and fled but presently they were back again
again i frightened them away and again they returned
i had flint and steel and tinder box when i had scared them from us a third time and they had gone only a little way i lit a splinter of pine and with it fired my heap of wood then dragged diccon into the light and sat down beside him with no longer any fear of the wolves but with absolute confidence in the quick appearance of less cowardly foes
there was wood enough and to spare when the fire sank low and the hungry eyes gleamed nearer i fed it again and the flame leaped up and mocked the eyes
no human enemy came upon us
the fire blazed and roared and the man who lay in its rosy glare raved on crying out now and then at the top of his voice but on that night of all nights of all years light and voice drew no savage band to put out the one and silence the other forever
hours passed and as it drew toward midnight diccon sank into a stupor
i knew that the end was not far away
the wolves were gone at last and my fire was dying down
he needed my touch upon his breast no longer and i went to the stream and bathed my hands and forehead and then threw myself face downward upon the bank
in a little while the desolate murmur of the water became intolerable and i rose and went back to the fire and to the man whom as god lives i loved as a brother
he was conscious
pale and cold and nigh gone as he was there came a light to his eyes and a smile to his lips when i knelt beside him
you did not go he breathed
no i answered i did not go  for a few minutes he lay with closed eyes when he again opened them upon my face there were in their depths a question and an appeal
i bent over him and asked him what he would have
you know he whispered
if you can
i would not go without it  is it that i asked
i forgave you long ago  i meant to kill you
i was mad because you struck me before the lady and because i had betrayed my trust
an you had not caught my hand i should be your murderer he spoke with long intervals between the words and the death dew was on his forehead
remember it not diccon i entreated
i too was to blame
and i see not that night for other nightsfor other nights and days diccon  he smiled but there was still in his face a shadowy eagerness
you said you would never strike me again he went on and that i was man of yours no more foreverand you gave me my freedom in the paper which i tore he spoke in gasps with his eyes upon mine
i'll be gone in a few minutes now
if i might go as your man still and could tell the lord jesus christ that my master on earth forgave and took back it would be a hand in the dark
i have spent my life in gathering darkness for myself at the last  i bent lower over him and took his hand in mine
diccon my man i said
a brightness came into his face and he faintly pressed my hand
i slipped my arm beneath him and raised him a little higher to meet his death
he was smiling now and his mind was not quite clear
do you mind sir he asked how green and strong and sweet smelled the pines that may day when we found virginia so many years ago  ay diccon i answered
before we saw the land the fragrance told us we were near it  i smell it now he went on and the bloom of the grape and the maytime flowers
and can you not hear sir the whistling and the laughter and the sound of the falling trees that merry time when smith made axemen of all our fine gentlemen  ay diccon i said
and the sound of the water that was dashed down the sleeve of any that were caught in an oath  he laughed like a little child
it is well that i was n't a gentleman and had not those trees to fell or i should have been as wet as any merman and pocahontas the little maid and how blue the sky was and how glad we were what time the patience and deliverance came in  his voice failed and for a minute i thought he was gone but he had been a strong man and life slipped not easily from him
when his eyes opened again he knew me not but thought he was in some tavern and struck with his hand upon the ground as upon a table and called for the drawer
around him were only the stillness and the shadows of the night but to his vision men sat and drank with him diced and swore and told wild tales of this or that
for a time he talked loudly and at random of the vile quality of the drink and his viler luck at the dice then he began to tell a story
as he told it his senses seemed to steady and he spoke with coherence and like a shadow of himself
and you call that a great thing william host he demanded
i can tell a true tale worth two such lies my masters
robin tapster more ale
and move less like a slug or my tankard and your ear will cry 'well met'
it was between ypres and courtrai friends and it's nigh fifteen years ago
there were fields in which nothing was sowed because they were ploughed with the hoofs of war horses and ditches in which dead men were thrown and dismal marshes and roads that were no roads at all but only sloughs
and there was a great stone house old and ruinous with tall poplars shivering in the rain and mist
into this house there threw themselves a band of dutch and english and hard on their heels came two hundred spaniards
all day they besieged that housesmoke and flame and thunder and shouting and the crash of masonryand when eventide was come we the dutch and the english thought that death was not an hour behind  he paused and made a gesture of raising a tankard to his lips
his eyes were bright his voice was firm
the memory of that old day and its mortal strife had wrought upon him like wine
there was one amongst us he said he was our captain and it's of him i am going to tell the story
robin tapster bring me no more ale but good mulled wine
it's cold and getting dark and i have to drink to a brave man besides  with the old bold laugh in his eyes he raised himself for the moment as strong as i that held him
drink to that englishman all of ye he cried and not in filthy ale but in good gentlemanly sack
i'll pay the score
here's to him brave hearts
here's to my master  with his hand at his mouth and his story untold he fell back
i held him in my arms until the brief struggle was over and then laid his body down upon the earth
it might have been one of the clock
for a little while i sat beside him with my head bowed in my hands
then i straightened his limbs and crossed his hands upon his breast and kissed him upon the brow and left him lying dead in the forest
it was hard going through the blackness of the nighttime woods
once i was nigh sucked under in a great swamp and once i stumbled into some hole or pit in the earth and for a time thought that i had broken my leg
the night was very dark and sometimes when i could not see the stars i lost my way and went to the right or the left or even back upon my track
though i heard the wolves they did not come nigh me
just before daybreak i crouched behind a log and watched a party of savages file past like shadows of the night
at last the dawn came and i could press on more rapidly
for two days and two nights i had not slept for a day and a night i had not tasted food
as the sun climbed the heavens a thousand black spots like summer gnats danced between his face and my weary eyes
the forest laid stumblingblocks before me and drove me back and made me wind in and out when i would have had my path straighter than an arrow
when the ground allowed i ran when i must break my way panting through undergrowth so dense and stubborn that it seemed some enchanted thicket where each twig snapped but to be on the instant stiff in place again i broke it with what patience i might when i must turn aside for this or that obstacle i made the detour though my heart cried out at the necessity
once i saw reason to believe that two or more indians were upon my trail and lost time in outwitting them and once i must go a mile out of my way to avoid an indian village
as the day wore on i began to go as in a dream
it had come to seem the gigantic wood of some fantastic tale through which i was traveling
the fallen trees ranged themselves into an abatis hard to surmount the thickets withstood one like iron the streamlets were like rivers the marshes leagues wide the treetops miles away
little things twisted roots trailing vines dead and rotten wood made me stumble
a wind was blowing that had blown just so since time began and the forest was filled with the sound of the sea
afternoon came and the shadows began to lengthen
they were lines of black paint spilt in a thousand places and stealing swiftly and surely across the brightness of the land
torn and bleeding and breathless i hastened on for it was drawing toward night and i should have been at jamestown hours before
my head pained me and as i ran i saw men and women stealing in and out among the trees before me pocahontas with her wistful eyes and braided hair and finger on her lips nantauquas dale the knightmarshal and argall with his fierce unscrupulous face my cousin george percy and my mother with her stately figure her embroidery in her hands
i knew that they were but phantoms of my brain but their presence confused and troubled me
the shadows ran together and the sunshine died out of the forest
stumbling on i saw through the thinning trees a long gleam of red and thought it was blood but presently knew that it was the river crimson from the sunset
a minute more and i stood upon the shore of the mighty stream between the two brightnesses of flood and heavens
there was a silver crescent in the sky with one white star above it and fair in sight down the james with lights springing up through the twilight was the townthe english town that we had built and named for our king and had held in the teeth of spain in the teeth of the wilderness and its terrors
it was not a mile away a little longera little longer and i could rest with my tidings told
the dusk had quite fallen when i reached the neck of land
the hut to which i had been enticed that night stood dark and ghastly with its door swinging in the wind
i ran past it and across the neck and arriving at the palisade beat upon the gate with my hands and called to the warder to open
when i had told him my name and tidings he did so with shaking knees and starting eyes
cautioning him to raise no alarm in the town i hurried by him into the street and down it toward the house that was set aside for the governor of virginia
i should find there now not yeardley but sir francis wyatt
the torches were lighted and the folk were indoors for the night was cold
one or two figures that i met or passed would have accosted me not knowing who i was but i brushed by them and hastened on
only when i passed the guest house i looked up and saw that mine host's chief rooms were yet in use
the governor's door was open and in the hall servingmen were moving to and fro
when i came in upon them they cried out as it had been a ghost and one fellow let a silver dish that he carried fall clattering to the floor
they shook and stood back as i passed them without a word and went on to the governor's great room
the door was ajar and i pushed it open and stood for a minute upon the threshold unobserved by the occupants of the room
after the darkness outside the lights dazzled me the room too seemed crowded with men though when i counted them there were not so many after all
supper had been put upon the table but they were not eating
before the fire his head thoughtfully bent and his fingers tapping upon the arm of his chair sat the governor over against him and as serious of aspect was the treasurer
west stood by the mantel tugging at his long mustaches and softly swearing
clayborne was in the room piersey the cape merchant and one or two besides
and rolfe was there walking up and down with hasty steps and a flushed and haggard face
his suit of buff was torn and stained and his greatboots were spattered with mud
the governor let his fingers rest upon the arm of his chair and raised his head
he is dead master rolfe he said
there can be no other conclusiona brave man lost to you and to the colony
we mourn with you sir  we too have searched jack put in west
we have not been idle though wellnigh all men believe that the indians who we know had a grudge against him murdered him and his man that night then threw their bodies into the river and themselves made off out of our reach
but we hoped against hope that when your party returned he would be in your midst  as for this latest loss continued the governor within an hour of its discovery this morning search parties were out yea if i had allowed it the whole town would have betaken itself to the woods
the searchers have not returned and we are gravely anxious
yet we are not utterly cast down
this trail can hardly be missed and the indians are friendly
there were a number in town overnight and they went with the searchers volunteering to act as their guides
we cannot but think that of this load our hearts will soon be eased  god grant it groaned rolfe
i will drink but a cup of wine sir and then will be gone upon this new quest  there was a movement in the room
you are worn and spent with your fruitless travel sir said the governor kindly
i give you my word that all that can be done is doing
wait at least for the morning and the good news it may bring  the other shook his head
i will go now
i could not look my friend in the face elsegod in heaven  the governor sprang to his feet through the treasurer's lips came a long sighing breath west's dark face was ashen
i came forward to the table and leaned my weight upon it for all the waves of the sea were roaring in my ears and the lights were going up and down
are you man or spirit cried rolfe through white lips
are you ralph percy  yes i am percy i said
i have not well understood what quest you would go upon rolfe but you cannot go tonight
and those parties that your honor talked of that have gone with indians to guide them to look for some lost personi think that you will never see them again  with an effort i drew myself erect and standing so told my tidings quietly and with circumstance so as to leave no room for doubt as to their verity or as to the sanity of him who brought them
they listened as the warder had listened with shaking limbs and gasping breath for this was the fall and wiping out of a people of which i brought warning
when all was told and they stood there before me white and shaken seeking in their minds the thing to say or do first i thought to ask a question myself but before my tongue could frame it the roaring of the sea became so loud that i could hear naught else and the lights all ran together into a wheel of fire
then in a moment all sounds ceased and to the lights succeeded the blackness of outer darkness
chapter xxxvi in which i hear ill news   when i awoke from the sleep or stupor into which i must have passed from that swoon it was to find myself lying upon a bed in a room flooded with sunshine
i was alone
for a moment i lay still staring at the blue sky without the window and wondering where i was and how i came there
a drum beat a dog barked and a man's quick voice gave a command
the sounds stung me into remembrance and i was at the window while the voice was yet speaking
it was west in the street below pointing with his sword now to the fort now to the palisade and giving directions to the armed men about him
there were many people in the street
women hurried by to the fort with white scared faces their arms filled with household gear children ran beside them sturdily bearing their share of the goods but pressing close to their elders' skirts men went to and fro the most grimly silent but a few talking loudly
not all of the faces in the crowd belonged to the town there were kingsmell and his wife from the main and john ellison from archer's hope and the italians vincencio and bernardo from the glass house
the nearer plantations then had been warned and their people had come for refuge to the city
a negro passed but on that morning alone of many days no indian aired his paint and feathers in the white man's village
i could not see the palisade across the neck but i knew that it was there that the fightif fight there werewould be made
should the indians take the palisade there would yet be the houses of the town and last of all the fort in which to make a stand
i believed not that they would take it
long since we had found out their method of warfare
they used ambuscade surprise and massacre when withstood in force and with determination they withdrew to their stronghold the forest there to bide their time until in the blackness of some night they could again swoop down upon a sleeping foe
the drum beat again and a messenger from the palisade came down the street at a run
they're in the woods over against us thicker than ants he cried to west as he passed
a boat has just drifted ashore yonder with two men in it dead and scalped  i turned to leave the room and ran against master pory coming in on tiptoe with a red and solemn face
he started when he saw me
the roll of the drum brought you to your feet then he cried
you've lain like the dead all night
i came but to see if you were breathing  when i have eaten i shall be myself again i said
there's no attack as yet  no he answered
they must know that we are prepared
but they have kindled fires along the river bank and we can hear them yelling
whether they'll be mad enough to come against us remains to be seen  the nearest settlements have been warned  ay
the governor offered a thousand pounds of tobacco and the perpetual esteem of the company to the man or men who would carry the news
six volunteered and went off in boats three up river three down
how many they reached or if they still have their scalps we know not
and awhile ago just before daybreak comes with frantic haste richard pace who had rowed up from pace's pains to tell the news which you had already brought
chanco the christian had betrayed the plot to him and he managed to give warning at powel's and one or two other places as he came up the river  he broke off but when i would have spoken interrupted me with and so you were on the pamunkey all this while
then the paspaheghs fooled us with the simple truth for they swore so stoutly that their absent chief men were but gone on a hunt toward the pamunkey that we had no choice but to believe them gone in quite another direction
and one and all of every tribe we questioned swore that opechancanough was at orapax
so master rolfe puts off up river to find if not you then the emperor and make him give up your murderers and the governor sends a party along the bay and west another up the chickahominy
and there you were all the time mewed up in the village above the marshes
and nantauquas after saving our lives like one of us is turned indian again
and your man is killed
alackaday
there's naught but trouble in the world
'as the sparks fly upwards' you know
but a brave man draws his breath and sets his teeth  in his manner his rapid talk his uneasy glances toward the door i found something forced and strange
i thought rolfe was behind me he said but he must have been delayed
there are meat and drink set out in the great room where the governor and those of the council who are safe here with us are advising together
let's descend you've not eaten and the good sack will give you strength
wilt come  ay i answered but tell me the news as we go
i have been gone ten daysfaith it seems ten years
there have no ships sailed master pory
the george is still here i looked him full in the eye for a sudden guess at a possible reason for his confusion had stabbed me like a knife
ay he said with a readiness that could scarce be feigned
she was to have sailed this week it is true the governor fearing to keep her longer
but the esperance coming in yesterday brought news which removed his honor's scruples
now she'll wait to see out this hand at the cards and to take home the names of those who are left alive in virginia
if the red varlets do swarm in upon us there are her twelvepounders they and the fort guns  i let him talk on
the george had not sailed
i saw again a firelit hut and a man and a panther who went down together
those claws had dug deep the man across whose face they had torn their way would keep his room in the guest house at jamestown until his wounds were somewhat healed
the george would wait for him would scarcely dare to sail without him and i should find the lady whom she was to carry away to england in virginia still
it was this that i had built upon the grain of comfort the passionate hope the sustaining cordial of those yearlong days in the village above the pamunkey
my heart was sore because of diccon but i could speak of that grief to her and she would grieve with me
there were awe and dread and stern sorrow in the knowledge that even now in the bright spring morning blood from a hundred homes might be flowing to meet the shining careless river but it was the springtime and she was waiting for me
i strode on toward the stairway so fast that when i asked a question master pory at my side was too out of breath to answer it
halfway down the stairs i asked it again and again received no answer save a zooks
you go too fast for my years and having in flesh
go more slowly ralph percy there's time enough there's time enough  there was a tone in his voice that i liked not for it savored of pity
i looked at him with knitted brows but we were now in the hall and through the open door of the great room i caught a glimpse of a woman's skirt
there were men in the hall servants and messengers who made way for us staring at me as they did so and whispering
i knew that my clothing was torn and muddied and stained with blood as we paused at the door there came to me in a flash that day in the courting meadow when i had tried with my dagger to scrape the dried mud from my boots
i laughed at myself for caring now and for thinking that she would care that i was not dressed for a lady's bower
the next moment we were in the great room
she was not there
the silken skirt that i had seen andthere being but one woman in all the world for mehad taken for hers belonged to lady wyatt who pale and terrified was sitting with clasped hands mutely following with her eyes her husband as he walked to and fro
west had come in from the street and was making some report
around the table were gathered two or three of the council master sandys stood at a window rolfe beside lady wyatt's chair
the room was filled with sunshine and a caged bird was singing singing
it made the only sound there when they saw that i stood amongst them
when i had made my bow to lady wyatt and to the governor and had clasped hands with rolfe i began to find in the silence as i had found in master pory's loquaciousness something strange
they looked at me uneasily and i caught a swift glance from the treasurer to master pory and an answering shake of the latter's head
rolfe was very white and his lips were set west was pulling at his mustaches and staring at the floor
with all our hearts we welcome you back to life and to the service of virginia captain percy said the governor when the silence had become awkward
a murmur of assent went round the room
i bowed
i thank you sir and these gentlemen very heartily
you have but to command me now
i find that i have today the best will in the world toward fighting
i trust that your honor does not deem it necessary to send me back to gaol  virginia has no gaol for captain percy he answered gravely
she has only grateful thanks and fullest sympathy  i glanced at him keenly
then i hold myself at your command sir when i shall have seen and spoken with my wife  he looked at the floor and they one and all held their peace
madam i said to lady wyatt i have been watching your ladyship's face
will you tell me why it is so very full of pity and why there are tears in your eyes  she shrank back in her chair with a little cry and rolfe stepped toward me then turned sharply aside
i cannot he cried i that know  i drew myself up to meet the blow whatever it might be
i demand of you my wife sir francis wyatt i said
if there is ill news to be told be so good as to tell it quickly
if she is sick or hath been sent away to england  the governor made as if to speak then turned and flung out his hands to his wife
't is woman's work margaret he cried
tell him  more merciful than the men she came to me at once the tears running down her cheeks and laid one trembling hand upon my arm
she was a brave lady captain percy she said
bear it as she would have had you bear it  i am bearing it madam i answered at length
'she was a brave lady'
may it please your ladyship to go on  i will tell you all captain percy i will tell you everything she never believed you dead and she begged upon her knees that we would allow her to go in search of you with master rolfe
that could not be my husband in duty to the company could not let her have her will
master rolfe went and she sat in the window yonder day after day watching for his return
when other parties went out she besought the men as they had wives whom they loved to search as though those loved ones were in captivity and danger when they grew weary and fainthearted to think of her face waiting in the window day after day she sat there watching for them to come back when they were come then she watched the river for master rolfe's boats
then came word down the river that he had found no trace of you whom he sought that he was on his way back to jamestown that he too believed you dead we put a watch upon her after that for we feared we knew not what there was such a light and purpose in her eyes
but two nights ago in the middle of the night the woman who stayed in her chamber fell asleep
when she awoke before the dawn it was to find her gone  to find her gone i said dully
to find her dead  she locked her hands together and the tears came faster
oh captain percy it had been better soit had been better so
then would she have lain to greet you calm and white unmarred and beautiful with the spring flowers upon her she believed not that you were dead she was distraught with grief and watching she thought that love might find what friendship missed she went to the forest to seek you
they that were sent to find and bring her back have never returned  into the forest i cried
jocelyn jocelyn jocelyn come back  some one pushed me into a chair and i felt the warmth of wine within my lips
in the moment that the world steadied i rose and went toward the door to find my way barred by rolfe
not you too ralph he cried
i will not let you go
look for yourself  he drew me to the window master sandys gravely making place for us
from the window was visible the neck of land and the forest beyond and from the forest up and down the river as far as the eye could reach rose here and there thin columns of smoke
suddenly as we stared three or four white smoke puffs like giant flowers started out of the shadowy woods across the neck
following the crack of the musketsfired out of pure bravado by their indian ownerscame the yelling of the savages
the sound was prolonged and deep as though issuing from many throats
i looked and listened and knew that i could not gonot now
she was not alone ralph said rolfe with his arm about me
on the morning that she was missed they found not jeremy sparrow either
they tracked them both to the forest by the footprints upon the sand though once in the wood the trail was lost
the minister must have been watching must have seen her leave the house and must have followed her
how she and he after her passed through the gates none know
so careless and confident had we growngod forgive usthat they may have been left open all that night
but he was with her ralph she had not to face it alonehis voice broke
for myself i was glad that the minister had been there though i knew that for him also i should grieve after a while
at the firing and the shouting west had rushed from the room followed by his fellow councilors and now the governor clapped on his headpiece and called to his men to bring his backandbreast
his wife hung around his neck and he bade her goodby with great tenderness
i looked dully on at that parting
i too was going to battle
once i had tasted such a farewell the pain the passion the sweetness but never againnever again
he went and the treasurer after a few words of comfort to lady wyatt was gone also
both were merciful and spoke not to me but only bowed and turned aside requiring no answering word or motion of mine
when they were away and there was no sound in the room save the caged bird's singing and lady wyatt's low sobs i begged rolfe to leave me telling him that he was needed as indeed he was and that i would stay in the window for a while and then would join him at the palisade
he was loath to go but he too had loved and lost and knew that there is nothing to be said and that it is best to be alone
he went and only lady wyatt and i kept the quiet room with the singing bird and the sunshine on the floor
i leaned against the window and looked out into the streetwhich was not crowded now for the men were all at their several postsand at the budding trees and at the smoke of many fires going up from the forest to the sky from a world of hate and pain and woe to the heaven where she dwelt and then i turned and went to the table where had been set bread and meat and wine
at the sound of my footstep lady wyatt uncovered her face
is there aught that i can do for you sir she asked timidly
i have not broken my fast for many hours madam i answered
i would eat and drink that i may not be found wanting in strength
there is a thing that i have yet to do  rising from her chair she brushed away her tears and coming to the table with a little housewifely eagerness would not let me wait upon myself but carved and poured for me and then sat down opposite me and covered her eyes with her hand
i think that the governor is quite safe madam i said
i do not believe that the indians will take the palisade
it may even be that knowing we are prepared they will not attack at all
indeed i think that you may be easy about him  she thanked me with a smile
it is all so strange and dreadful to me sir she said
at my home in england it was like a sunday morning all the year roundall stillness and peace no terror no alarm
i fear that i am not yet a good virginian  when i had eaten and had drunk the wine she gave me i rose and asked her if i might not see her safe within the fort before i joined her husband at the palisade
she shook her head and told me that there were with her faithful servants and that if the savages broke in upon the town she would have warning in time to flee the fort being so close at hand
when i thereupon begged her leave to depart she first curtsied to me and then again with tears came to me and took my hand in hers
i know that there is naught that i can say
your wife loved you sir with all her heart she drew something from the bosom of her gown
would you like this
it is a knot of ribbon that she wore
they found it caught in a bush at the edge of the forest  i took the ribbon from her and put it to my lips then unknotted it and tied it around my arm and then wearing my wife's colors i went softly out into the street and turned my face toward the guest house and the man whom i meant to kill
chapter xxxvii in which my lord and i part company   the door of the guest house stood wide and within the lower room were neither men that drank nor men that gave to drink
host and drawers and chance guests alike had left pipe and tankard for sword and musket and were gone to fort or palisade or river bank
i crossed the empty room and went up the creaking stairway
no one met me or withstood me only a pigeon perched upon the sill of a sunny window whirred off into the blue
i glanced out of the window as i passed it and saw the silver river and the george and the esperance with the gunners at the guns watching for indian canoes and saw smoke rising from the forest on the southern shore
there had been three houses therejohn west's and minifie's and crashaw's
i wondered if mine were burning too at weyanoke and cared not if 't was so
the door of the upper room was shut
when i raised the latch and pushed against it it gave at the top and middle but there was some pressure from within at the bottom
i pushed again more strongly and the door slowly opened moving away whatever thing had lain before it
another moment and i was in the room and had closed and barred the door behind me
the weight that had opposed me was the body of the italian lying face downwards upon the floor
i stooped and turned it over and saw that the venomous spirit had flown
the face was purple and distorted the lips were drawn back from the teeth in a dreadful smile
there was in the room a faint peculiar not unpleasant odor
it did not seem strange to me to find that serpent which had coiled in my path dead and harmless for evermore
death had been busy of late if he struck down the flower why should he spare the thing that i pushed out of my way with my foot
ten feet from the door stood a great screen hiding from view all that might be beyond
it was very quiet in the room with the sunshine coming through the window and a breeze that smelt of the sea
i had not cared to walk lightly or to close the door softly and yet no voice had challenged my entrance
for a minute i feared to find the dead physician the room's only occupant then i passed the screen and came upon my enemy
he was sitting beside a table with his arms outstretched and his head bowed upon them
my footfall did not rouse him he sat there in the sunshine as still as the figure that lay before the threshold
i thought with a dull fury that maybe he was dead already and i walked hastily and heavily across the floor to the table
he was a living man for with the fingers of one hand he was slowly striking against a sheet of paper that lay beneath them
he knew not that i stood above him he was listening to other footsteps
the paper was a letter unfolded and written over with great black characters
the few lines above those moving fingers stared me in the face
they ran thus i told you that you had as well cut your throat as go upon that mad virginia voyage
now all's gonewealth honors favor
buckingham is the sun in heaven and cold are the shadows in which we walk who hailed another luminary
there's a warrant out for the black death look to it that one meets not you too when you come at last
but come in the name of all the fiends and play your last card
there's your cursed beauty still
come and let the king behold your face once morethe rest was hidden
i put out my hand and touched him upon the shoulder and he raised his head and stared at me as at one come from the grave
over one side of his face from temple to chin was drawn and fastened a black cloth the unharmed cheek was bloodless and shrunken the lip twisted
only the eyes dark sinister and splendid were as they had been
i dig not my graves deep enough he said
is she behind you there in the shadow  flung across a chair was a cloak of scarlet cloth
i took it and spread it out upon the floor then unsheathed a dagger which i had taken from the rack of weapons in the governor's hall
loosen thy poniard thou murderer i cried and come stand with me upon the cloak  art quick or dead he answered
i will not fight the dead he had not moved in his seat and there was a lethargy and a dullness in his voice and eyes
there is time enough he said
i too will soon be of thy world thou haggard bloody shape
wait until i come and i will fight thee shadow to shadow  i am not dead i said but there is one that is
stand up villain and murderer or i will kill you sitting there with her blood upon your hands  he rose at that and drew his dagger from the sheath
i laid aside my doublet and he followed my example but his hands moved listlessly and his fingers bungled at the fastenings
i waited for him in some wonder it not being like him to come tardily to such pastime
he came at length slowly and with an uncertain step and we stood together on the scarlet cloak
i raised my left arm and he raised his and we locked hands
there was no strength in his clasp his hand lay within mine cold and languid
art ready i demanded
yea he answered in a strange voice but i would that she did not stand there with her head upon your breast
i too loved thee jocelynjocelyn lying dead in the forest  i struck at him with the dagger in my right hand and wounded him but not deeply in the side
he gave blow for blow but his poniard scarce drew blood so nerveless was the arm that would have driven it home
i struck again and he stabbed weakly at the air then let his arm drop to his side as though the light and jeweled blade had weighed it down
loosening the clasp of our left hands i fell back until the narrow scarlet field was between us
hast no more strength than that i cried
i cannot murder you  he stood looking past me as into a great distance
he was bleeding but i had as yet been able to strike no mortal blow
it is as you choose  he said
i am as one bound before you
i am sick unto death  turning he went back swaying as he walked to his chair and sinking into it sat there a minute with halfclosed eyes then raised his head and looked at me with a shadow of the old arrogance pride and disdain upon his scarred face
not yet captain he demanded
to the heart man
so i would strike an you sat here and i stood there  i know you would i said and going to the window i flung the dagger down into the empty street then stood and watched the smoke across the river and thought it strange that the sun shone and the birds sang
when i turned to the room again he still sat there in the great chair a tragic splendid figure with his ruined face and the sullen woe of his eyes
i had sworn to kill you i said
it is not just that you should live  he gazed at me with something like a smile upon his bloodless lips
fret not thyself ralph percy he said
within a week i shall be gone
did you see my servant my italian doctor lying dead upon the floor there beyond the screen
he had poisons had nicolo whom men called the black deathpoisons swift and strong or subtle and slow
day and night the earth and sunshine have become hateful to me
i will go to the fires of hell and see if they can make me forgetcan make me forget the face of a woman he was speaking half to me half to himself
her eyes are dark and large he said and there are shadows beneath them and the mark of tears
she stands there day and night with her eyes upon me
her lips are parted but she never speaks
there was a way that she had with her hands holding them one within the other thus  i stopped him with a cry for silence and i leaned trembling against the table
thou wretch i cried
thou art her murderer  he raised his head and looked beyond me with that strange faint smile
i know he replied with the dignity which was his at times
you may play the headsman if you choose
i dispute not your right
but it is scarce worth while
i have taken poison  the sunshine came into the room and the wind from the river and the trumpet notes of swans flying to the north
the george is ready for sailing he said at last
tomorrow or the next day she will be going home with the tidings of this massacre
i shall go with her and within a week they will bury me at sea
there is a stealthy slow and secret poison
i would not die in a land where i have lost every throw of the dice and i would not die in england for buckingham to come and look upon my face and so i took that poison
for the man upon the floor thereprison and death awaited him at home
he chose to flee at once  he ceased to speak and sat with his head bowed upon his breast
if you are content that it should be as it is he said at length perhaps you will leave me
i am not good company today  his hand was busy again with the letter upon the table and his gaze was fixed beyond me
i have lost he muttered
how i came to play my cards so badly i do not know
the stake was heavyi have not wherewithal to play again  his head sank upon his outstretched arm
as for me i stood a minute with set lips and clenched hands and then i turned and went out of the room and down the stair and out into the street
in the dust beneath the window lay my dagger
i picked it up sheathed it and went my way
the street was very quiet
all windows and doors were closed and barred not a soul was there to trouble me with look or speech
the yelling from the forest had ceased only the keen wind blew and brought from the esperance upon the river a sound of singing
the sea was the home of the men upon her decks and their hearts dwelt not in this port they could sing while the smoke went up from our homes and the dead lay across the thresholds
i went on through the sunshine and the stillness to the minister's house
the trees in the garden were bare the flowers dead
the door was not barred
i entered the house and went into the great room and flung the heavy shutters wide then stood and looked about me
naught was changed it was as we had left it that wild november night
even the mirror which one other night had shown me diccon still hung upon the wall
master bucke had been seldom at home perhaps or was feeble and careless of altering matters
all was as though we had been but an hour gone save that no fire burned upon the hearth
i went to the table and the books upon it were jeremy sparrow's the minister's house then had been his home once more
beside the books lay a packet tied with silk sealed and addressed to me
perhaps the governor had given it the day before into master bucke's carei do not know at any rate there it lay
i looked at the by the esperance  upon the cover and wondered dully who at home would care to write to me then broke the seal and untied the silk
within the cover there was a letter with the superscription to a gentleman who has served me well  i read the letter through to the signature which was that of his grace of buckingham and then i laughed who had never thought to laugh again and threw the paper down
it mattered naught to me now that george villiers should be grateful or that james stewart could deny a favorite nothing
the king graciously sanctions the marriage of his sometime ward the lady jocelyn leigh with captain ralph percy invites them home  she was gone home and i her husband i who loved her was left behind
how many years of pilgrimage how long how long o lord
the minister's great armchair was drawn before the cold and blackened hearth
how often she had sat there within its dark clasp the firelight on her dress her hands her face
she had been fair to look upon the pride the daring the willfulness were but the thorns about the rose behind those defenses was the flower pure and lovely with a heart of gold
i flung myself down beside the chair and putting my arms across it hid my face upon them and could weep at last
that passion spent itself and i lay with my face against the wood and wellnigh slept
the battle was done the field was lost the storm and stress of life had sunk into this dull calm as still as peace as hopeless as the charred log and white ash upon the hearth cold never to be quickened again
time passed and at length i raised my head roused suddenly to the consciousness that for a while there had been no stillness
the air was full of sound shouts savage cries the beating of a drum the noise of musketry
i sprang to my feet and went to the door to meet rolfe crossing the threshold
he put his arm within mine and drew me out into the sunshine upon the doorstep
i thought i should find you here he said but it is only a room with its memories ralph
out here is more breadth more height
there is country yet ralph and after a while friends
the indians are beginning to attack in force
humphry boyse is killed and morris chaloner
there is smoke over the plantations up and down the river as far as we can see and awhile ago the body of a child drifted down to us  i am unarmed i said
i will but run to the fort for sword and musket  no need he answered
there are the dead whom you may rob the noise increasing as he spoke we made no further tarrying but leaving behind us house and garden hurried to the palisade
chapter xxxviii in which i go upon a quest   through a loophole in the gate of the palisade i looked and saw the sandy neck joining the town to the main and the deep and dark woods beyond the fairy mantle giving invisibility to a host
between us and that refuge dead men lay here and there stiff and stark with the black paint upon them and the colored feathers of their headdresses red or blue against the sand
one warrior shot through the back crawled like a wounded beetle to the forest
we let him go for we cared not to waste ammunition upon him
i drew back from my loophole and held out my hand to the women for a freshly loaded musket
a quick murmur like the drawing of a breath came from our line
the governor standing near me cast an anxious glance along the stretch of wooden stakes that were neither so high nor so thick as they should have been
i am new to this warfare captain percy he said
do they think to use those logs that they carry as battering rams  as scaling ladders your honor i replied
it is on the cards that we may have some sword play after all  we'll take your advice the next time we build a palisade ralph percy muttered west on my other side
mounting the breastwork that we had thrown up to shelter the women who were to load the muskets he coolly looked over the pales at the oncoming savages
wait until they pass the blasted pine men he cried
then give them a hail of lead that will beat them back to the pamunkey  an arrow whistled by his ear a second struck him on the shoulder but pierced not his coat of mail
he came down from his dangerous post with a laugh
if the leader could be picked offi said
it's a long shot but there's no harm in trying  as i spoke i raised my gun to my shoulder but he leaned across rolfe who stood between us and plucked me by the sleeve
you've not looked at him closely
look again  i did as he told me and lowered my musket
it was not for me to send that indian leader to his account
rolfe's lips tightened and a sudden pallor overspread his face
nantauquas he muttered in my ear and i nodded yes
the volley that we fired full into the ranks of our foe was deadly and we looked to see them turn and flee as they had fled before
but this time they were led by one who had been trained in english steadfastness
broken for the moment they rallied and came on yelling bearing logs thick branches of trees oars tied togetheranything by whose help they could hope to surmount the palisade
we fired again but they had planted their ladders
before we could snatch the loaded muskets from the women a dozen painted figures appeared above the sharpened stakes
a moment and they and a score behind them had leaped down upon us
it was no time now to skulk behind a palisade
at all hazards that tide from the forest must be stemmed
those that were amongst us we might kill but more were swarming after them and from the neck came the exultant yelling of madly hurrying reinforcements
we flung open the gates
i drove my sword through the heart of an indian who would have opposed me and calling for men to follow me sprang forward
perhaps thirty came at my call together we made for the opening
a party of the savages in our midst interposed
we set upon them with sword and musket butt and though they fought like very devils drove them before us through the gateway
behind us were wild clamor the shrieking of women the stern shouts of the english the whooping of the savages before us a rush that must be met and turned
it was done
a moment's fierce fighting then the indians wavered broke and fled
like sheep we drove them before us across the neck to the edge of the forest into which they plunged
into that ambush we cared not to follow but fell back to the palisade and the town believing and with reason that the lesson had been taught
the strip of sand was strewn with the dead and the dying but they belonged not to us
our dead numbered but three and we bore their bodies with us
within the palisade we found the english in sufficiently good case
of the score or more indians cut off by us from their mates and penned within that death trap half at least were already dead run through with sword and pike shot down with the muskets that there was now time to load
the remainder hemmed about pressed against the wall were fast meeting with a like fate
they stood no chance against us we cared not to make prisoners of them it was a slaughter but they had taken the initiative
they fought with the courage of despair striving to spring in upon us striking when they could with hatchet and knife and through it all talking and laughing making god knows what savage boasts what taunts against the english what references to the hunting grounds to which they were going
they were brave men that we slew that day
at last there was left but the leaderunharmed unwounded though time and again he had striven to close with some one of us to strike and to die striking with his fellows
behind him was the wall of the half circle which he faced wellnigh all were old soldiers and servants of the colony gentlemen none of whom had come in later than dalerolfe west wynne and others
we were swordsmen all
when in his desperation he would have thrown himself upon us we contented ourselves with keeping him at sword's length and at last west sent the knife in the dark hand whirling over the palisade
some one had shouted to the musketeers to spare him
when he saw that he stood alone he stepped back against the wall drew himself up to his full height and folded his arms
perhaps he thought that we would shoot him down then and there perhaps he saw himself a captive amongst us a show for the idle and for the strangers that the ships brought in
the din had ceased and we the living the victors stood and looked at the vanquished dead at our feet and at the dead beyond the gates and at the neck upon which was no living foe and at the blue sky bending over all
our hearts told us and told us truly that the lesson had been taught that no more forever need we at jamestown fear an indian attack
and then we looked at him whose life we had spared
he opposed our gaze with his folded arms and his head held high and his back against the wall
many of us could remember him a proud shy lad coming for the first time from the forest with his sister to see the english village and its wonders
for idleness we had set him in our midst that summer day long ago on the green by the fort and had called him your royal highness laughing at the quickness of our wit and admiring the spirit and bearing of the lad and the promise he gave of a splendid manhood
and all knew the tale i had brought the night before
slowly as one man and with no spoken word we fell back the half circle straightening into a line and leaving a clear pathway to the open gates
the wind had ceased to blow i remember and a sunny stillness lay upon the sand and the roughhewn wooden stakes and a little patch of tender grass across which stretched a dead man's arm
the church bells began to ring
the indian out of whose path to life and freedom we had stepped glanced from the line of lowered steel to the open gates and the forest beyond and understood
for a full minute he waited moving not a muscle still and stately as some noble masterpiece in bronze
then he stepped from the shadow of the wall and moved past us through the sunshine that turned the eagle feather in his scalp lock to gold
his eyes were fixed upon the forest there was no change in the superb calm of his face
he went by the huddled dead and the long line of the living that spoke no word and out of the gates and across the neck walking slowly that we might yet shoot him down if we saw fit to repent ourselves and proudly like a king's son
there was no sound save the church bells ringing for our deliverance
he reached the shadow of the trees a moment and the forest had back her own
we sheathed our swords and listened to the governor's few earnest words of thankfulness and of recognition of this or that man's service and then we set to work to clear the ground of the dead to place sentinels to bring the town into order to determine what policy we should pursue to search for ways by which we might reach and aid those who might be yet alive in the plantations above and below us
we could not go through the forest where every tree might hide a foe but there was the river
for the most part the houses of the english had been built like mine at weyanoke very near to the water
i volunteered to lead a party up river and wynne to go with another toward the bay
but as the council at the governor's was breaking up and as wynne and i were hurrying off to make our choice of the craft at the landing there came a great noise from the watchers upon the bank and a cry that boats were coming down the stream
it was so and there were in them white men nearly all of whom had their wounds to show and cowering women and children
one boat had come from the plantation at paspahegh and two from martinbrandon they held all that were left of the people a woman had in her lap the body of a child and would not let us take it from her another with a halfsevered arm crouched above a man who lay in his blood in the bottom of the boat
thus began that strange procession that lasted throughout the afternoon and night and into the next day when a sloop came down from henricus with the news that the english were in force there to stand their ground although their loss had been heavy
hour after hour they came as fast as sail and oar could bring them the panicstricken folk whose homes were burned whose kindred were slain who had themselves escaped as by a miracle
many were sorely wounded so that they died when we lifted them from the boats others had slighter hurts
each boatload had the same tale to tell of treachery surprise and fiendish butchery
wherever it had been possible the english had made a desperate defense in the face of which the savages gave way and finally retired to the forest
contrary to their wont the indians took few prisoners but for the most part slew outright those whom they seized wreaking their spite upon the senseless corpses
a man too good for this world george thorpe who would think no evil was killed and his body mutilated by those whom he had taught and loved
and nathaniel powel was dead and four others of the council besides many more of name and note
there were many women slain and little children
from the stronger hundreds came tidings of the number lost and that the survivors would hold the homes that were left for the time at least
the indians had withdrawn it remained to be seen if they were satisfied with the havoc they had wrought
would his honor send by boatthere could be no traveling through the woodsnews of how others had fared and also powder and shot
before the dawning we had heard from all save the remoter settlements
the blow had been struck and the hurt was deep
but it was not beyond remedy thank god
it is known what measures we took for our protection and how soon the wound to the colony was healed and what vengeance we meted out to those who had set upon us in the dark and had failed to reach the heart
these things belong to history and i am but telling my own storymine and another's
in the chill and darkness of the hour before dawn something like quiet fell upon the distracted breathless town
there was a pause in the coming of the boats
the wounded and the dying had been cared for and the noise of the women and the children was stilled at last
all was well at the palisade the strong party encamped upon the neck reported the forest beyond them as still as death
in the governor's house was held a short council subdued and quiet for we were all of one mind and our words were few
it was decided that the george should sail at once with the tidings and with an appeal for arms and powder and a supply of men
the esperance would still be with us besides the hopeingod and the tiger the margaret and john would shortly come in being already overdue
my lord carnal goes upon the george gentlemen said master pory
he sent but now to demand if she sailed tomorrow
he is ill and would be at home  one or two glanced at me but i sat with a face like stone and the governor rising broke up the council
i left the house and the street that was lit with torches and noisy with going to and fro and went down to the river
rolfe had been detained by the governor west commanded the party at the neck
there were great fires burning along the river bank and men watching for the incoming boats but i knew of a place where no guard was set and where one or two canoes were moored
there was no firelight there and no one saw me when i entered a canoe and cut the rope and pushed off from the land
wellnigh a day and a night had passed since lady wyatt had told me that which made for my heart a nighttime indeed
i believed my wife to be deadyea i trusted that she was dead
i hoped that it had been quickly overone blow
better that oh better that a thousand times than that she should have been carried off to some village saved today to die a thousand deaths tomorrow
but i thought that there might have been left lying on the dead leaves of the forest that fair shell from which the soul had flown
i knew not where to goto the north to the east to the westbut go i must
i had no hope of finding that which i went to seek and no thought but to take up that quest
i was a soldier and i had stood to my post but now the need was past and i could go
in the hall at the governor's house i had written a line of farewell to rolfe and had given the paper into the hand of a trusty fellow charging him not to deliver it for two hours to come
i rowed two miles downstream through the quiet darknessso quiet after the hubbub of the town
when i turned my boat to the shore the day was close at hand
the stars were gone and a pale cold light more desolate than the dark streamed from the east across which ran like a faded blood stain a smear of faint red
upon the forest the mist lay heavy
when i drove the boat in amongst the sedge and reeds below the bank i could see only the trunks of the nearest trees hear only the sullen cry of some river bird that i had disturbed
why i was at some pains to fasten the boat to a sycamore that dipped a pallid arm into the stream i do not know
i never thought to come back to the sycamore i never thought to bend to an oar again to behold again the river that the trees and the mist hid from me before i had gone twenty yards into the forest
chapter xxxix in which we listen to a song   it was like a may morning so mild was the air so gay the sunshine when the mist had risen
wild flowers were blooming and here and there unfolding leaves made a delicate fretwork against a deep blue sky
the wind did not blow everywhere were stillness soft and sweet dewy freshness careless peace
hour after hour i walked slowly through the woodland pausing now and then to look from side to side
it was idle going wandering in a desert with no guiding star
the place where i would be might lie to the east to the west
in the wide enshrouding forest i might have passed it by
i believed not that i had done so
surely surely i should have known surely the voice that lived only in my heart would have called to me to stay
beside a newly felled tree in a glade starred with small white flowers i came upon the bodies of a man and a boy so hacked so hewn so robbed of all comeliness that at the sight the heart stood still and the brain grew sick
farther on was a clearing and in its midst the charred and blackened walls of what had been a home
i crossed the freshly turned earth and looked in at the cabin door with the stillness and the sunshine
a woman lay dead upon the floor her outstretched hand clenched upon the foot of a cradle
i entered the room and looking within the cradle found that the babe had not been spared
taking up the little waxen body with the blood upon its innocent breast i laid it within the mother's arms and went my way over the sunny doorstep and the earth that had been made ready for planting
a white butterflythe first of the yearfluttered before me then rose through a mist of green and passed from my sight
the sun climbed higher into the deep blue sky
save where grew pines or cedars there were no shadowy places in the forest
the slight green of uncurling leaves the airy scarlet of the maples the bare branches of the tardier trees opposed no barrier to the sunlight
it streamed into the world below the treetops and lay warm upon the dead leaves and the green moss and the fragile wild flowers
there was a noise of birds and a fox barked
all was lightness gayety and warmth the sap was running the heyday of the spring at hand
ah
to be riding with her to be going home through the fairy forest the sunshine and the singing
the happy miles to weyanoke the smell of the sassafras in its woods the house all lit and trimmed
the fire kindled the wine upon the table diccon's welcoming face and his hand upon black lamoral's bridle the minister too maybe with his great heart and his kindly eyes her hand in mine her head upon my breast  the vision faded
never never never for me a homecoming such as that so deep so dear so sweet
the men who were my friends the woman whom i loved had gone into a far country
this world was not their home
they had crossed the threshold while i lagged behind
the door was shut and without were the night and i
with the fading of the vision came a sudden consciousness of a presence in the forest other than my own
i turned sharply and saw an indian walking with me step for step but with a space between us of earth and brown tree trunks and drooping branches
for a moment i thought that he was a shadow not substance then i stood still waiting for him to speak or to draw nearer
at the first glimpse of the bronze figure i had touched my sword but when i saw who it was i let my hand fall
he too paused but he did not offer to speak
with his hand upon a great bow he waited motionless in the sunlight
a minute or more thus then i walked on with my eyes upon him
at once he addressed himself to motion not speaking or making any sign or lessening the distance between us but moving as i moved through the light and shade the warmth and stillness of the forest
for a time i kept my eyes upon him but soon i was back with my dreams again
it seemed not worth while to wonder why he walked with me who was now the mortal foe of the people to whom he had returned
from the river bank the sycamore and the boat that i had fastened there i had gone northward toward the pamunkey from the clearing and the ruined cabin with the dead within it i had turned to the eastward
now in that hopeless wandering i would have faced the north again
but the indian who had made himself my traveling companion stopped short and pointed to the east
i looked at him and thought that he knew maybe of some war party between us and the pamunkey and would save me from it
a listlessness had come upon me and i obeyed the pointing finger
so estranged and silent with two spears' length of earth between us we went on until we came to a quiet stream flowing between low dark banks
again i would have turned to the northward but the son of powhatan gliding before me set his face down the stream toward the river i had left
a minute in which i tried to think and could not because in my ears was the singing of the birds at weyanoke then i followed him
how long i walked in a dream hand in hand with the sweetness of the past i do not know but when the present and its anguish weighed again upon my heart it was darker colder stiller in the forest
the soundless stream was bright no longer the golden sunshine that had lain upon the earth was all gathered up the earth was dark and smooth and bare with not a flower the tree trunks were many and straight and tall
above were no longer brown branch and blue sky but a deep and sombre green thick woven keeping out the sunlight like a pall
i stood still and gazed around me and knew the place
to me whose heart was haunted the dismal wood the charmed silence the withdrawal of the light were less than nothing
all day i had looked for one sight of horror yea had longed to come at last upon it to fall beside it to embrace it with my arms
there there though it should be some fair and sunny spot there would be my haunted wood
as for this place of gloom and stillness it fell in with my mood
more welcome than the mocking sunshine were this cold and solemn light this deathlike silence these ranged pines
it was a place in which to think of life as a slight thing and scarcely worth the while given without the asking spent in turmoil strife suffering and longings all in vain
easily laid down tooso easily laid down that the wonder was  i looked at the ghostly wood and at the dull stream and at my hand upon the hilt of the sword that i had drawn halfway from the scabbard
the life within that hand i had not asked for
why should i stand like a soldier left to guard a thing not worth the guarding seeing his comrades march homeward hearing a cry to him from his distant hearthstone
i drew my sword wellnigh from its sheath and then of a sudden i saw the matter in a truer light knew that i was indeed the soldier and willed to be neither coward nor deserter
the blade dropped back into the scabbard with a clang and straightening myself i walked on beside the sluggish stream deep into the haunted wood
presently it occurred to me to glance aside at the indian who had kept pace with me through the forest
he was not there he walked with me no longer save for myself there seemed no breathing creature in the dim wood
i looked to right and left and saw only the tall straight pines and the needlestrewn ground
how long he had been gone i could not tell
he might have left me when first we came to the pines for my dreams had held me and i had not looked his way
there was that in the twilight place or in the strangeness the horror and the yearning that had kept company with me that day or in the dull weariness of a mind and body overwrought of late which made thought impossible
i went on down the stream toward the river because it chanced that my face was set in that direction
how dark was the shadow of the pines how lifeless the earth beneath how faint and far away the blue that showed here and there through rifts in the heavy roof of foliage
the stream bending to one side i turned with it and there before me stood the minister
i do not know what strangled cry burst from me
the earth was rocking all the wood a glare of light
as for him at the sight of me and the sound of my voice he had staggered back against a tree but now recovering himself he ran to me and put his great arms about me
from the power of the dog from the lion's mouth he cried brokenly
and they slew thee not ralph the heathen who took thee away
yesternight i learned that you lived but i looked not for you here  i scarce heard or marked what he was saying and found no time in which to wonder at his knowledge that i had not perished
i only saw that he was alone and that in the evening wood there was no sign of other living creature
yea they slew me not jeremy i said
i would that they had done so
and you are alone
i am glad that you died not my friend yes faith i am very glad that one escaped
tell me about it and i will sit here upon the bank and listen
was it done in this wood
a gloomy deathbed friend for one so young and fair
she should have died to soft music in the sunshine with flowers about her  with an exclamation he put me from him but kept his hand upon my arm and his steady eyes upon my face
she loved laughter and sunshine and sweet songs i continued
she can never know them in this wood
they are outside they are outside the world i think
it is sad is it not
faith i think it is the saddest thing i have ever known  he clapped his other hand upon my shoulder
wake man he commanded
if thou shouldst go mad nowwake
thy brain is turning
hold to thyself
stand fast as thou art soldier and christian
ralph she is not dead
she will wear flowersthy flowerssing laugh move through the sunshine of earth for many and many a year please god
art listening ralph
canst hear what i am saying  i hear i said at last but i do not well understand  he pushed me back against a pine and held me there with his hands upon my shoulders
listen he said speaking rapidly and keeping his eyes upon mine
all those days that you were gone when all the world declared you dead she believed you living
she saw party after party come back without you and she believed that you were left behind in the forest
also she knew that the george waited but for the search to be quite given over and for my lord carnal's recovery
she had been told that the king's command might not be defied that the governor had no choice but to send her from virginia
ralph i watched her and i knew that she meant not to go upon that ship
three nights agone she stole from the governor's house and passing through the gates that the sleeping warder had left unfastened went toward the forest
i saw her and followed her and at the edge of the forest i spoke to her
i stayed her not i brought her not back ralph because i was convinced that an i did so she would die
i knew of no great danger and i trusted in the lord to show me what to do step by step and how to guide her gently back when she was weary of wanderingwhen worn out she was willing to give up the quest for the dead
art following me ralph  yes i answered and took my hand from my eyes
i was nigh mad jeremy for my faith was not like hers
i have looked on death too much of late and yesterday all men believed that he had come to dwell in the forest and had swept clean his house before him
but you escaped you both escaped  god's hand was over us he said reverently
this is the way of it
she had been ill you know and of late she had taken no thought of food or sleep
she was so weak we had to go so slowly and so winding was our path who knew not the country that the evening found us not far upon our way if way we had
we came to a cabin in a clearing and they whose home it was gave us shelter for the night
in the morning when the father and son would go forth to their work we walked with them
when they came to the trees they meant to fell we bade them goodby and went on alone
we had not gone an hundred paces when looking back we saw three indians start from the dimness of the forest and set upon and slay the man and the boy
that murder done they gave chase to me who caught up thy wife and ran for both our lives
when i saw that they were light of foot and would overtake me i set my burden down and drawing a sword that i had with me went back to meet them halfway
ralph i slew all threemay the lord have mercy on my soul
i knew not what to think of that attack the peace with the indians being so profound and i began to fear for thy wife's safety
she knew not the woods and i managed to turn our steps back toward jamestown without her knowledge that i did so
it was about midday when we saw the gleam of the river through the trees before us and heard the sound of firing and of a great yelling
i made her crouch within a thicket while i myself went forward to reconnoitre and wellnigh stumbled into the midst of an army
yelling painted maddened brandishing their weapons toward the town human hair dabbled with blood at the belts of manyin the name of god ralph what is the meaning of it all  it means i said that yesterday they rose against us and slew us by the hundred
the town was warned and is safe
go on  i crept back to madam he continued and hurried her away from that dangerous neighborhood
we found a growth of bushes and hid ourselves within it and just in time for from the north came a great band of picked warriors tall and black and wondrously feathered fresh to the fray whatever the fray might be
they joined themselves to the imps upon the river bank and presently we heard another great din with more firing and more yelling
well to make a long story short we crouched there in the bushes until late afternoon not knowing what was the matter and not daring to venture forth to find out
the woman of the cabin at which we had slept had given us a packet of bread and meat so we were not without food but the time was long
and then of a sudden the wood around us was filled with the heathen band after band coming from the river stealing like serpents this way and that into the depths of the forest
they saw us not in the thick bushes maybe it was because of the prayers which i said with might and main
at last the distance swallowed them the forest seemed clear no sound no motion
long we waited but with the sunset we stole from the bushes and down an aisle of the forest toward the river rounded a little wood of cedar and came full upon perhaps fifty of the savageshe paused to draw a great breath and to raise his brows after a fashion that he had
go on go on i cried
what did you do
you have said that she is alive and safe  she is he answered but no thanks to me though i did set lustily upon that painted fry
who led them d' ye think ralph
who saved us from those bloody hands  a light broke in upon me
i know i said
and he brought you here  ay he sent away the devils whose color he is worse luck
he told us that there were indians not of his tribe between us and the town
if we went on we should fall into their hands
but there was a place that was shunned by the indian as by the white man we could bide there until the morrow when we might find the woods clear
he guided us to this dismal wood that was not altogether strange to us
ay he told her that you were alive
he said no more than that all at once when we were well within the wood and the twilight was about us he was gone  he ceased to speak and stood regarding me with a smile upon his rugged face
i took his hand and raised it to my lips
i owe you more than i can ever pay i said
where is she my friend  not far away he answered
we sought the centre of the wood and because she was so chilled and weary and shaken i did dare to build a fire there
not a foe has come against us and we waited but for the dusk of this evening to try to make the town
i came down to the stream just now to find if i could how near we were to the river  he broke off made a gesture with his hand toward one of the long aisles of pine trees and then with a muttered god bless you both left me and going a little way down the stream stood with his back to a great tree and his eyes upon the slow deep water
she was coming
i watched the slight figure grow out of the dusk between the trees and the darkness in which i had walked of late fell away
the wood that had been so gloomy was a place of sunlight and song had red roses sprung up around me i had felt no wonder
she came softly and slowly with bent head and hanging arms not knowing that i was near
i went not to meet herit was my fancy to have her come to me stillbut when she raised her eyes and saw me i fell upon my knees
for a moment she stood still with her hands at her bosom then softly and slowly through the dusky wood she came to me and touched me upon the shoulder
art come to take me home she asked
i have wept and prayed and waited long but now the spring is here and the woods are growing green  i took her hands and bowed my head upon them
i believed thee dead  i said
i thought that thou hadst gone home indeed and i was left in the world alone
i can never tell thee how i love thee  i need no telling she answered
i am glad that i did so forget my womanhood as to come to virginia on such an errand glad that they did laugh at and insult me in the meadow at jamestown for else thou mightst have given me no thought very heartily glad that thou didst buy me with thy handful of tobacco
with all my heart i love thee my knight my lover my lord and husbandher voice broke and i felt the trembling of her frame
i love not thy tears upon my hands she murmured
i have wandered far and am weary
wilt rise and put thy arm around me and lead me home  i stood up and she came to my arms like a tired bird to its nest
i bent my head and kissed her upon the brow the blueveined eyelids the perfect lips
i love thee i said
the song is old but it is sweet
see
i wear thy color my lady  the hand that had touched the ribbon upon my arm stole upwards to my lips
an old song but a sweet one she said
i love thee
i will always love thee
my head may lie upon thy breast but my heart lies at thy feet  there was joy in the haunted wood deep peace quiet thankfulness a springtime of the heartnot riotous like the may but fair and grave and tender like the young world in the sunshine without the pines
our lips met again and then with my arm around her we moved to the giant pine beneath which stood the minister
he turned at our approach and looked at us with a quiet and tender smile though the water stood in his eyes
'heaviness may endure for a night' he said 'but joy cometh in the morning'
i thank god for you both  last summer in the green meadow we knelt before you while you blessed us jeremy i answered
bless us now again true friend and man of god  he laid his hands upon our bowed heads and blessed us and then we three moved through the dismal wood and beside the sluggish stream down to the great bright river
ere we reached it the pines had fallen away the haunted wood was behind us our steps were set through a fairy world of greening bough and springing bloom
the blue sky laughed above the late sunshine barred our path with gold
when we came to the river it lay in silver at our feet making low music amongst its reeds
i had bethought me of the boat which i had fastened that morning to the sycamore between us and the town and now we moved along the river bank until we should come to the tree
though we walked through an enemy's country we saw no foe
stillness and peace encompassed us it was like a beautiful dream from which one fears no wakening
as we went i told them speaking low for we knew not if we were yet in safety of the slaughter that had been made and of diccon
my wife shuddered and wept and the minister drew long breaths while his hands opened and closed
and then when she asked me i told of how i had been trapped to the ruined hut that night and of all that had followed
when i had done she turned within my arm and clung to me with her face hidden
i kissed her and comforted her and presently we came to the sycamore tree reaching out over the clear water and to the boat that i had fastened there
the sunset was nigh at hand and all the west was pink
the wind had died away and the river lay like tinted glass between the dark borders of the forest
above the sky was blue while in the south rose clouds that were like pillars tall and golden
the air was soft as silk there was no sound other than the ripple of the water about our keel and the low dash of the oars
the minister rowed while i sat idle beside my love
he would have it so and i made slight demur
we left the bank behind us and glided into the midstream for it was as well to be out of arrowshot
the shadow of the forest was gone still and bright around us lay the mighty river
when at length the boat head turned to the west we saw far up the stream the roofs of jamestown dark against the rosy sky
there is a ship going home said the minister
we to whom he spoke looked with him down the river and saw a tall ship with her prow to the ocean
all her sails were set the last rays of the sinking sun struck against her poop windows and made of them a halfmoon of fire
she went slowly for the wind was light but she went surely away from the new land back to the old down the stately river to the bay and the wide ocean and to the burial at sea of one upon her
with her pearly sails and the line of flame color beneath she looked a dwindling cloud a little while and she would be claimed of the distance and the dusk
it is the george i said
the lady who sat beside me caught her breath
ay sweetheart i went on
she carries one for whom she waited
he has gone from out our life forever  she uttered a low cry and turned to me trembling her lips parted her eyes eloquent
we will not speak of him i said
as if he were dead let his name rest between us
i have another thing to tell thee dear heart dear court lady masking as a waiting damsel dear ward of the king whom his majesty hath thundered against for so many weary months
would it grieve thee to go home after all  home she asked
to weyanoke
that would not grieve me  not to weyanoke but to england i said
the george is gone but three days since the esperance came in
when she sails again i think that we must go  she gazed at me with a whitening face
and you she whispered
how will you go
in chains  i took her clasped hands parted them and drew her arms around my neck
ay i answered i will go in chains that i care not to have broken
my dear love i think that the summer lies fair before us
listen while i tell thee of news that the esperance brought  while i told of new orders from the company to the governor and of my letter from buckingham the minister rested upon his oars that he might hear the better
when i had ceased to speak he bent to them again and his tireless strength sent us swiftly over the glassy water toward the town that was no longer distant
i am more glad than i can tell you ralph and jocelyn he said and the smile with which he spoke made his face beautiful
the light streaming to us from the ruddy west laid roses in the cheeks of the sometime ward of the king and the low wind lifted the dark hair from her forehead
her head was on my breast her hand in mine we cared not to speak we were so happy
on her finger was her wedding ring the ring that was only a link torn from the gold chain prince maurice had given me
when she saw my eyes upon it she raised her hand and kissed the rude circlet
the hue of the sunset lingered in cloud and water and in the pale heavens above the rose and purple shone the evening star
the cloudlike ship at which we had gazed was gone into the distance and the twilight we saw her no more
broad between its blackening shores stretched the james mirroring the bloom in the west the silver star the lights upon the esperance that lay between us and the town
aboard her the mariners were singing and their song of the sea floated over the water to us sweetly and like a love song
we passed the ship unhailed and glided on to the haven where we would be
the singing behind us died away but the song in our hearts kept on
all things die not while the soul lives love lives the song may be now gay now plaintive but it is deathless
