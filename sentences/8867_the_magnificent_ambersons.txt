chapter i   major amberson had made a fortune in  when other people were losing fortunes and the magnificence of the ambersons began then
magnificence like the size of a fortune is always comparative as even magnificent lorenzo may now perceive if he has happened to haunt new york in  and the ambersons were magnificent in their day and place
their splendour lasted throughout all the years that saw their midland town spread and darken into a city but reached its topmost during the period when every prosperous family with children kept a newfoundland dog
in that town in those days all the women who wore silk or velvet knew all the other women who wore silk or velvet and when there was a new purchase of sealskin sick people were got to windows to see it go by
trotters were out in the winter afternoons racing light sleighs on national avenue and tennessee street everybody recognized both the trotters and the drivers and again knew them as well on summer evenings when slim buggies whizzed by in renewals of the snowtime rivalry
for that matter everybody knew everybody else's family horseandcarriage could identify such a silhouette half a mile down the street and thereby was sure who was going to market or to a reception or coming home from office or store to noon dinner or evening supper
during the earlier years of this period elegance of personal appearance was believed to rest more upon the texture of garments than upon their shaping
a silk dress needed no remodelling when it was a year or so old it remained distinguished by merely remaining silk
old men and governors wore broadcloth full dress was broadcloth with doeskin  trousers and there were seen men of all ages to whom a hat meant only that rigid tall silk thing known to impudence as a stovepipe  in town and country these men would wear no other hat and without selfconsciousness they went rowing in such hats
shifting fashions of shape replaced aristocracy of texture dressmakers shoemakers hatmakers and tailors increasing in cunning and in power found means to make new clothes old
the long contagion of the derby  hat arrived one season the crown of this hat would be a bucket the next it would be a spoon
every house still kept its bootjack but hightopped boots gave way to shoes and congress gaiters and these were played through fashions that shaped them now with toes like boxends and now with toes like the prows of racing shells
trousers with a crease were considered plebeian the crease proved that the garment had lain upon a shelf and hence was readymade these betraying trousers were called handmedowns in allusion to the shelf
in the early 'eighties while bangs and bustles were having their way with women that variation of dandy known as the dude was invented he wore trousers as tight as stockings daggerpointed shoes a spoon derby a singlebreasted coat called a chesterfield with short flaring skirts a torturing cylindrical collar laundered to a polish and three inches high while his other neckgear might be a heavy puffed cravat or a tiny bow fit for a doll's braids
with evening dress he wore a tan overcoat so short that his black coattails hung visible five inches below the overcoat but after a season or two he lengthened his overcoat till it touched his heels and he passed out of his tight trousers into trousers like great bags
then presently he was seen no more though the word that had been coined for him remained in the vocabularies of the impertinent
it was a hairier day than this
beards were to the wearers' fancy and things as strange as the kaiserliche boartusk moustache were commonplace
sideburns found nourishment upon childlike profiles great dundreary whiskers blew like tippets over young shoulders moustaches were trained as lambrequins over forgotten mouths and it was possible for a senator of the united states to wear a mist of white whisker upon his throat only not a newspaper in the land finding the ornament distinguished enough to warrant a lampoon
surely no more is needed to prove that so short a time ago we were living in another age
at the beginning of the ambersons' great period most of the houses of the midland town were of a pleasant architecture
they lacked style but also lacked pretentiousness and whatever does not pretend at all has style enough
they stood in commodious yards well shaded by leftover forest trees elm and walnut and beech with here and there a line of tall sycamores where the land had been made by filling bayous from the creek
the house of a prominent resident facing military square or national avenue or tennessee street was built of brick upon a stone foundation or of wood upon a brick foundation
usually it had a front porch and a back porch often a side porch too
there was a front hall there was a side hall and sometimes a back hall from the front hall opened three rooms the parlour the sitting room and the library and the library could show warrant to its titlefor some reason these people bought books
commonly the family sat more in the library than in the sitting room while callers when they came formally were kept to the parlour a place of formidable polish and discomfort
the upholstery of the library furniture was a little shabby but the hostile chairs and sofa of the parlour always looked new
for all the wear and tear they got they should have lasted a thousand years
upstairs were the bedrooms motherandfather's room the largest a smaller room for one or two sons another for one or two daughters each of these rooms containing a double bed a washstand a bureau a wardrobe a little table a rockingchair and often a chair or two that had been slightly damaged downstairs but not enough to justify either the expense of repair or decisive abandonment in the attic
and there was always a spareroom for visitors where the sewingmachine usually was kept and during the 'seventies there developed an appreciation of the necessity for a bathroom
therefore the architects placed bathrooms in the new houses and the older houses tore out a cupboard or two set up a boiler beside the kitchen stove and sought a new godliness each with its own bathroom
the great american plumber joke that manybranched evergreen was planted at this time
at the rear of the house upstairs was a bleak little chamber called the girl's room and in the stable there was another bedroom adjoining the hayloft and called the hired man's room house and stable cost seven or eight thousand dollars to build and people with that much money to invest in such comforts were classified as the rich
they paid the inhabitant of the girl's room two dollars a week and in the latter part of this period two dollars and a half and finally three dollars a week
she was irish ordinarily or german or it might be scandinavian but never native to the land unless she happened to be a person of colour
the man or youth who lived in the stable had like wages and sometimes he too was lately a steerage voyager but much oftener he was coloured
after sunrise on pleasant mornings the alleys behind the stables were gay laughter and shouting went up and down their dusty lengths with a lively accompaniment of currycombs knocking against back fences and stable walls for the darkies loved to curry their horses in the alley
darkies always prefer to gossip in shouts instead of whispers and they feel that profanity unless it be vociferous is almost worthless
horrible phrases were caught by early rising children and carried to older people for definition sometimes at inopportune moments while less investigative children would often merely repeat the phrases in some subsequent flurry of agitation and yet bring about consequences so emphatic as to be recalled with ease in middle life
they have passed those darky hiredmen of the midland town and the introspective horses they curried and brushed and whacked and amiably cursedthose good old horses switch their tails at flies no more
for all their seeming permanence they might as well have been buffaloesor the buffalo laprobes that grew bald in patches and used to slide from the careless drivers' knees and hang unconcerned half way to the ground
the stables have been transformed into other likenesses or swept away like the woodsheds where were kept the stovewood and kindling that the girl and the hiredman always quarrelled over who should fetch it
horse and stable and woodshed and the whole tribe of the hiredman all are gone
they went quickly yet so silently that we whom they served have not yet really noticed that they are vanished
so with other vanishings
there were the little bunty streetcars on the long single track that went its troubled way among the cobblestones
at the rear door of the car there was no platform but a step where passengers clung in wet clumps when the weather was bad and the car crowded
the patronsif not too absentmindedput their fares into a slot and no conductor paced the heaving floor but the driver would rap remindingly with his elbow upon the glass of the door to his little open platform if the nickels and the passengers did not appear to coincide in number
a lone mule drew the car and sometimes drew it off the track when the passengers would get out and push it on again
they really owed it courtesies like this for the car was genially accommodating a lady could whistle to it from an upstairs window and the car would halt at once and wait for her while she shut the window put on her hat and cloak went downstairs found an umbrella told the girl what to have for dinner and came forth from the house
the previous passengers made little objection to such gallantry on the part of the car they were wont to expect as much for themselves on like occasion
in good weather the mule pulled the car a mile in a little less than twenty minutes unless the stops were too long but when the trolleycar came doing its mile in five minutes and better it would wait for nobody
nor could its passengers have endured such a thing because the faster they were carried the less time they had to spare
in the days before deathly contrivances hustled them through their lives and when they had no telephonesanother ancient vacancy profoundly responsible for leisurethey had time for everything time to think to talk time to read time to wait for a lady
they even had time to dance square dances quadrilles and lancers they also danced the racquette and schottisches and polkas and such whims as the portland fancy they pushed back the sliding doors between the parlour and the sitting room tacked down crash over the carpets hired a few palms in green tubs stationed three or four italian musicians under the stairway in the front halland had great nights
but these people were gayest on new year's day they made it a true festivalsomething no longer known
the women gathered to assist the hostesses who kept open house and the carefree men dandified and perfumed went about in sleighs or in carriages and ponderous hacks  going from open house to open house leaving fantastic cards in fancy baskets as they entered each doorway and emerging a little later more carefree than ever if the punch had been to their liking
it always was and as the afternoon wore on pedestrians saw great gesturing and waving of skintight lemon gloves while ruinous fragments of song were dropped behind as the carriages rolled up and down the streets
keeping open house was a merry custom it has gone like the allday picnic in the woods and like that prettiest of all vanished customs the serenade
when a lively girl visited the town she did not long go unserenaded though a visitor was not indeed needed to excuse a serenade
of a summer night young men would bring an orchestra under a pretty girl's windowor it might be her father's or that of an ailing maiden auntand flute harp fiddle 'cello cornet and bass viol would presently release to the dulcet stars such melodies as sing through you'll remember me i dreamt that i dwelt in marble halls  silver threads among the gold kathleen mavourneen or the soldier's farewell  they had other music to offer too for these were the happy days of olivette and the macotte and the chimes of normandy and giroflegirofla and fra diavola better than that these were the days of pinafore and the pirates of penzance and of patience this last was needed in the midland town as elsewhere for the aesthetic movement had reached thus far from london and terrible things were being done to honest old furniture
maidens sawed whatnots in two and gilded the remains
they took the rockers from rockingchairs and gilded the inadequate legs they gilded the easels that supported the crayon portraits of their deceased uncles
in the new spirit of art they sold old clocks for new and threw wax flowers and wax fruit and the protecting glass domes out upon the trashheap
they filled vases with peacock feathers or cattails or sumac or sunflowers and set the vases upon mantelpieces and marbletopped tables
they embroidered daisies which they called marguerites and sunflowers and sumac and cattails and owls and peacock feathers upon plush screens and upon heavy cushions then strewed these cushions upon floors where fathers fell over them in the dark
in the teeth of sinful oratory the daughters went on embroidering they embroidered daisies and sunflowers and sumac and cattails and owls and peacock feathers upon throws  which they had the courage to drape upon horsehair sofas they painted owls and daisies and sunflowers and sumac and cattails and peacock feathers upon tambourines
they hung chinese umbrellas of paper to the chandeliers they nailed paper fans to the walls
they studied  painting on china these girls they sang tosti's new songs they sometimes still practiced the old genteel habit of ladyfainting and were most charming of all when they drove forth three or four in a basket phaeton on a spring morning
croquet and the mildest archery ever known were the sports of people still young and active enough for so much exertion middleage played euchre
there was a theatre next door to the amberson hotel and when edwin booth came for a night everybody who could afford to buy a ticket was there and all the hacks in town were hired
the black crook  also filled the theatre but the audience then was almost entirely of men who looked uneasy as they left for home when the final curtain fell upon the shocking girls dressed as fairies
but the theatre did not often do so well the people of the town were still too thrifty
they were thrifty because they were the sons or grandsons of the early settlers who had opened the wilderness and had reached it from the east and the south with wagons and axes and guns but with no money at all
the pioneers were thrifty or they would have perished they had to store away food for the winter or goods to trade for food and they often feared they had not stored enoughthey left traces of that fear in their sons and grandsons
in the minds of most of these indeed their thrift was next to their religion to save even for the sake of saving was their earliest lesson and discipline
no matter how prosperous they were they could not spend money either upon art or upon mere luxury and entertainment without a sense of sin
against so homespun a background the magnificence of the ambersons was as conspicuous as a brass band at a funeral
major amberson bought two hundred acres of land at the end of national avenue and through this tract he built broad streets and crossstreets paved them with cedar block and curbed them with stone
he set up fountains here and there where the streets intersected and at symmetrical intervals placed castiron statues painted white with their titles clear upon the pedestals minerva mercury hercules venus gladiator emperor augustus fisher boy staghound mastiff greyhound fawn antelope wounded doe and wounded lion
most of the forest trees had been left to flourish still and at some distance or by moonlight the place was in truth beautiful but the ardent citizen loving to see his city grow wanted neither distance nor moonlight
he had not seen versailles but standing before the fountain of neptune in amberson addition at bright noon and quoting the favourite comparison of the local newspapers he declared versailles outdone
all this art showed a profit from the start for the lots sold well and there was something like a rush to build in the new addition
its main thoroughfare an oblique continuation of national avenue was called amberson boulevard and here at the juncture of the new boulevard and the avenue major amberson reserved four acres for himself and built his new housethe amberson mansion of course
this house was the pride of the town
faced with stone as far back as the diningroom windows it was a house of arches and turrets and girdling stone porches it had the first portecochere seen in that town
there was a central front hall with a great black walnut stairway and open to a green glass skylight called the dome three stories above the ground floor
a ballroom occupied most of the third story and at one end of it was a carved walnut gallery for the musicians
citizens told strangers that the cost of all this black walnut and woodcarving was sixty thousand dollars
sixty thousand dollars for the woodwork alone
yes sir and hardwood floors all over the house
turkish rugs and no carpets at all except a brussels carpet in the front parlouri hear they call it the 'receptionroom'
hot and cold water upstairs and down and stationary washstands in every last bedroom in the place
their sideboard's built right into the house and goes all the way across one end of the dining room
it isn't walnut it's solid mahogany
not veneeringsolid mahogany
well sir i presume the president of the united states would be tickled to swap the white house for the new amberson mansion if the major'd give him the chancebut by the almighty dollar you bet your sweet life the major wouldn't  the visitor to the town was certain to receive further enlightenment for there was one form of entertainment never omitted he was always patriotically taken for a little drive around our city even if his host had to hire a hack and the climax of the display was the amberson mansion
look at that greenhouse they've put up there in the side yard the escort would continue
and look at that brick stable
most folks would think that stable plenty big enough and good enough to live in it's got running water and four rooms upstairs for two hired men and one of 'em's family to live in
they keep one hired man loafin' in the house and they got a married hired man out in the stable and his wife does the washing
they got boxstalls for four horses and they keep a coupay and some new kinds of fancy rigs you never saw the beat of
'carts' they call two of 'em'way up in the air they aretoo high for me
i guess they got every new kind of fancy rig in there that's been invented
and harnesswell everybody in town can tell when ambersons are out driving after dark by the jingle
this town never did see so much style as ambersons are putting on these days and i guess it's going to be expensive because a lot of other folks'll try to keep up with 'em
the major's wife and the daughter's been to europe and my wife tells me since they got back they make tea there every afternoon about five o'clock and drink it
seems to me it would go against a person's stomach just before supper like that and anyway tea isn't fit for muchnot unless you're sick or something
my wife says ambersons don't make lettuce salad the way other people do they don't chop it up with sugar and vinegar at all
they pour olive oil on it with their vinegar and they have it separatenot along with the rest of the meal
and they eat these olives too green things they are something like a hard plum but a friend of mine told me they tasted a good deal like a bad hickorynut
my wife says she's going to buy some you got to eat nine and then you get to like 'em she says
well i wouldn't eat nine bad hickorynuts to get to like them and i'm going to let these olives alone
kind of a woman's dish anyway i suspect but most everybody'll be makin' a stagger to worm through nine of 'em now ambersons brought 'em to town
yes sir the rest'll eat 'em whether they get sick or not
looks to me like some people in this city'd be willing to go crazy if they thought that would help 'em to be as hightoned as ambersons
old aleck minaferhe's about the closest old codger we gothe come in my office the other day and he pretty near had a stroke tellin' me about his daughter fanny
seems miss isabel amberson's got some kind of a dogthey call it a saint bernardand fanny was bound to have one too
well old aleck told her he didn't like dogs except ratterriers because a ratterrier cleans up the mice but she kept on at him and finally he said all right she could have one
then by george
she says ambersons bought their dog and you can't get one without paying for it they cost from fifty to a hundred dollars up
old aleck wanted to know if i ever heard of anybody buyin' a dog before because of course even a newfoundland or a setter you can usually get somebody to give you one
he says he saw some sense in payin' a nigger a dime or even a quarter to drown a dog for you but to pay out fifty dollars and maybe morewell sir he like to choked himself to death right there in my office
of course everybody realizes that major amberson is a fine business man but what with throwin' money around for dogs and every which and what some think all this style's bound to break him up if his family don't quit  one citizen having thus discoursed to a visitor came to a thoughtful pause and then added does seem pretty much like squandering yet when you see that dog out walking with this miss isabel he seems worth the money  what's she look like  well sir said the citizen she's not more than just about eighteen or maybe nineteen years old and i don't know as i know just how to put itbut she's kind of a delightful lookin' young lady     chapter ii   another citizen said an eloquent thing about miss isabel amberson's looks
this was mrs henry franklin foster the foremost literary authority and intellectual leader of the communityfor both the daily newspapers thus described mrs foster when she founded the women's tennyson club and her word upon art letters and the drama was accepted more as law than as opinion
naturally when hazel kirke  finally reached the town after its long triumph in larger places many people waited to hear what mrs henry franklin foster thought of it before they felt warranted in expressing any estimate of the play
in fact some of them waited in the lobby of the theatre as they came out and formed an inquiring group about her
i didn't see the play she informed them
what
why we saw you right in the middle of the fourth row  yes she said smiling but i was sitting just behind isabelle amberson
i couldn't look at anything except her wavy brown hair and the wonderful back of her neck  the ineligible young men of the town they were all ineligible were unable to content themselves with the view that had so charmed mrs henry franklin foster they spent their time struggling to keep miss amberson's face turned toward them
she turned it most often observers said toward two one excelling in the general struggle by his sparkle and the other by that winning if not winsome old trait persistence
the sparkling gentleman led germans with her and sent sonnets to her with his bouquetssonnets lacking neither music nor wit
he was generous poor welldressed and his amazing persuasiveness was one reason why he was always in debt
no one doubted that he would be able to persuade isabel but he unfortunately joined too merry a party one night and during a moonlight serenade upon the lawn before the amberson mansion was easily identified from the windows as the person who stepped through the bass viol and had to be assisted to a waiting carriage
one of miss amberson's brothers was among the serenaders and when the party had dispersed remained propped against the front door in a state of helpless liveliness the major going down in a dressinggown and slippers to bring him in and scolding mildly while imperfectly concealing strong impulses to laughter
miss amberson also laughed at this brother the next day but for the suitor it was a different matter she refused to see him when he called to apologize
you seem to care a great deal about bass viols he wrote her
i promise never to break another she made no response to the note unless it was an answer two weeks later when her engagement was announced
she took the persistent one wilbur minafer no breaker of bass viols or of hearts no serenader at all
a few people who always foresaw everything claimed that they were not surprised because though wilbur minafer might not be an apollo as it were he was a steady young business man and a good churchgoer and isabel amberson was pretty sensiblefor such a showy girl but the engagement astounded the young people and most of their fathers and mothers too and as a topic it supplanted literature at the next meeting of the women's tennyson club  wilbur minafer a member cried her inflection seeming to imply that wilbur's crime was explained by his surname
wilbur minafer
it's the queerest thing i ever heard
to think of her taking wilbur minafer just because a man any woman would like a thousand times better was a little wild one night at a serenade  no said mrs henry franklin foster
it isn't that
it isn't even because she's afraid he'd be a dissipated husband and she wants to be safe
it isn't because she's religious or hates wildness it isn't even because she hates wildness in him  well but look how she's thrown him over for it  no that wasn't her reason said the wise mrs henry franklin foster
if men only knew itand it's a good thing they don'ta woman doesn't really care much about whether a man's wild or not if it doesn't affect herself and isabel amberson doesn't care a thing  mrs
foster  no she doesn't
what she minds is his making a clown of himself in her front yard
it made her think he didn't care much about her
she's probably mistaken but that's what she thinks and it's too late for her to think anything else now because she's going to be married right awaythe invitations will be out next week
it'll be a big ambersonstyle thing raw oysters floating in scoopedout blocks of ice and a band from outoftownchampagne showy presents a colossal present from the major
then wilbur will take isabel on the carefulest little wedding trip he can manage and she'll be a good wife to him but they'll have the worst spoiled lot of children this town will ever see  how on earth do you make that out mrs foster  she couldn't love wilbur could she mrs foster demanded with no challengers
well it will all go to her children and she'll ruin 'em  the prophetess proved to be mistaken in a single detail merely except for that her foresight was accurate
the wedding was of ambersonian magnificence even to the floating oysters and the major's colossal present was a set of architect's designs for a house almost as elaborate and impressive as the mansion the house to be built in amberson addition by the major
the orchestra was certainly not that local one which had suffered the loss of a bass viol the musicians came according to the prophecy and next morning's paper from afar and at midnight the bride was still being toasted in champagne though she had departed upon her wedding journey at ten
four days later the pair had returned to town which promptness seemed fairly to demonstrate that wilbur had indeed taken isabel upon the carefulest little trip he could manage
according to every report she was from the start a good wife to him but here in a final detail the prophecy proved inaccurate
wilbur and isabel did not have children they had only one
only one mrs henry franklin foster admitted
but i'd like to know if he isn't spoiled enough for a whole carload  again she found none to challenge her
at the age of nine george amberson minafer the major's one grandchild was a princely terror dreaded not only in amberson addition but in many other quarters through which he galloped on his white pony
by golly i guess you think you own this town an embittered labourer complained one day as georgie rode the pony straight through a pile of sand the man was sieving
i will when i grow up the undisturbed child replied
i guess my grandpa owns it now you bet and the baffled workman having no means to controvert what seemed a mere exaggeration of the facts could only mutter oh pull down your vest  don't haf to
doctor says it ain't healthy the boy returned promptly
but i'll tell you what i'll do i'll pull down my vest if you'll wipe off your chin  this was stock and stencil the accustomed argot of street badinage of the period and in such matters georgie was an expert
he had no vest to pull down the incongruous fact was that a fringed sash girdled the juncture of his velvet blouse and breeches for the fauntleroy period had set in and georgie's mother had so poor an eye for appropriate things where georgie was concerned that she dressed him according to the doctrine of that school in boy decoration
not only did he wear a silk sash and silk stockings and a broad lace collar with his little black velvet suit he had long brown curls and often came home with burrs in them
except upon the surface which was not his own work but his mother's georgie bore no vivid resemblance to the fabulous little cedric
the storied boy's famous lean on me grandfather would have been difficult to imagine upon the lips of georgie
a month after his ninth birthday anniversary when the major gave him his pony he had already become acquainted with the toughest boys in various distant parts of the town and had convinced them that the toughness of a rich little boy with long curls might be considered in many respects superior to their own
he fought them learning how to go berserk at a certain point in a fight bursting into tears of anger reaching for rocks uttering wailed threats of murder and attempting to fulfil them
fights often led to intimacies and he acquired the art of saying things more exciting than don't haf to and doctor says it ain't healthy thus on a summer afternoon a strange boy sitting bored upon the gatepost of the reverend malloch smith beheld george amberson minafer rapidly approaching on his white pony and was impelled by bitterness to shout shoot the ole jackass
look at the girly curls
say bub where'd you steal your mother's ole sash  your sister stole it for me georgie instantly replied checking the pony
she stole it off our clo'esline an' gave it to me  you go get your hair cut said the stranger hotly
yah
i haven't got any sister  i know you haven't at home georgie responded
i mean the one that's in jail  i dare you to get down off that pony  georgie jumped to the ground and the other boy descended from the reverend mr smith's gatepostbut he descended inside the gate
i dare you outside that gate said georgie
yah
i dare you half way here
i dare you  but these were luckless challenges for georgie immediately vaulted the fenceand four minutes later mrs malloch smith hearing strange noises looked forth from a window then screamed and dashed for the pastor's study
mr malloch smith that grimbearded methodist came to the front yard and found his visiting nephew being rapidly prepared by master minafer to serve as a principal figure in a pageant of massacre
it was with great physical difficulty that mr smith managed to give his nephew a chance to escape into the house for georgie was hard and quick and in such matters remarkably intense but the minister after a grotesque tussle got him separated from his opponent and shook him
you stop that you georgie cried fiercely and wrenched himself away
i guess you don't know who i am  yes i do know the angered mr smith retorted
i know who you are and you're a disgrace to your mother
your mother ought to be ashamed of herself to allow  shut up about my mother bein' ashamed of herself  mr smith exasperated was unable to close the dialogue with dignity
she ought to be ashamed he repeated
a woman that lets a bad boy like you  but georgie had reached his pony and mounted
before setting off at his accustomed gallop he paused to interrupt the reverend malloch smith again
you pull down your vest you ole billygoat you he shouted distinctly
pull down your vest wipe off your chinan' go to hell  such precocity is less unusual even in children of the rich than most grown people imagine
however it was a new experience for the reverend malloch smith and left him in a state of excitement
he at once wrote a note to georgie's mother describing the crime according to his nephew's testimony and the note reached mrs minafer before georgie did
when he got home she read it to him sorrowfully
dear madam your son has caused a painful distress in my household
he made an unprovoked attack upon a little nephew of mine who is visiting in my household insulted him by calling him vicious names and falsehoods stating that ladies of his family were in jail
he then tried to make his pony kick him and when the child who is only eleven years old while your son is much older and stronger endeavoured to avoid his indignities and withdraw quietly he pursued him into the enclosure of my property and brutally assaulted him
when i appeared upon this scene he deliberately called insulting words to me concluding with profanity such as go to hell which was heard not only by myself but by my wife and the lady who lives next door
i trust such a state of undisciplined behaviour may be remedied for the sake of the reputation for propriety if nothing higher of the family to which this unruly child belongs
georgie had muttered various interruptions and as she concluded the reading he said he's an ole liar  georgie you mustn't say 'liar'
isn't this letter the truth  well said georgie how old am i  ten  well look how he says i'm older than a boy eleven years old  that's true said isabel
he does
but isn't some of it true georgie  georgie felt himself to be in a difficulty here and he was silent
georgie did you say what he says you did  which one  did you tell him totodid you say 'go to hell  georgie looked worried for a moment longer then he brightened
listen here mamma grandpa wouldn't wipe his shoe on that ole storyteller would he  georgie you mustn't  i mean none of the ambersons wouldn't have anything to do with him would they
he doesn't even know you does he mamma  that hasn't anything to do with it  yes it has
i mean none of the amberson family go to see him and they never have him come in their house they wouldn't ask him to and they prob'ly wouldn't even let him  that isn't what we're talking about  i bet said georgie emphatically i bet if he wanted to see any of 'em he'd haf to go around to the side door  no dear they  yes they would mamma
so what does it matter if i did say somep'm' to him he didn't like
that kind o' people i don't see why you can't say anything you want to to 'em  no georgie
and you haven't answered me whether you said that dreadful thing he says you did  well said georgie
anyway he said somep'm' to me that made me mad and upon this point he offered no further details he would not explain to his mother that what had made him mad was mr smith's hasty condemnation of herself your mother ought to be ashamed and a woman that lets a bad boy like you georgie did not even consider excusing himself by quoting these insolences
isabel stroked his head
they were terrible words for you to use dear
from his letter he doesn't seem a very tactful person but  he's just riffraff said georgie
you mustn't say so his mother gently agreed where did you learn those bad words he speaks of
where did you hear any one use them  well i've heard 'em several places
i guess uncle george amberson was the first i ever heard say 'em
uncle george amberson said 'em to papa once
papa didn't like it but uncle george was just laughin' at papa an' then he said 'em while he was laughin'  that was wrong of him she said but almost instinctively he detected the lack of conviction in her tone
it was isabel's great failing that whatever an amberson did seemed right to her especially if the amberson was either her brother george or her son george
she knew that she should be more severe with the latter now but severity with him was beyond her power and the reverend malloch smith had succeeded only in rousing her resentment against himself
georgie's symmetrical facealtogether an amberson facehad looked never more beautiful to her
it always looked unusually beautiful when she tried to be severe with him
you must promise me she said feebly never to use those bad words again  i promise not to he said promptlyand he whispered an immediate codicil under his breath unless i get mad at somebody this satisfied a code according to which in his own sincere belief he never told lies
that's a good boy she said and he ran out to the yard his punishment over
some admiring friends were gathered there they had heard of his adventure knew of the note and were waiting to see what was going to happen to him
they hoped for an account of things and also that he would allow them to take turns riding his pony to the end of the alley and back
they were really his henchmen georgie was a lord among boys
in fact he was a personage among certain sorts of grown people and was often fawned upon the alley negroes delighted in him chuckled over him flattered him slavishly
for that matter he often heard welldressed people speaking of him admiringly a group of ladies once gathered about him on the pavement where he was spinning a top
i know this is georgie one exclaimed and turned to the others with the impressiveness of a showman
major amberson's only grandchild the others said it is and made clicking sounds with their mouths two of them loudly whispering so handsome  georgie annoyed because they kept standing upon the circle he had chalked for his top looked at them coldly and offered a suggestion  oh go hire a hall  as an amberson he was already a public character and the story of his adventure in the reverend malloch smith's front yard became a town topic
many people glanced at him with great distaste thereafter when they chanced to encounter him which meant nothing to georgie because he innocently believed most grown people to be necessarily crosslooking as a normal phenomenon resulting from the adult state and he failed to comprehend that the distasteful glances had any personal bearing upon himself
if he had perceived such a bearing he would have been affected only so far probably as to mutter riffraff possibly he would have shouted it and certainly most people believed a story that went round the town just after mrs amberson's funeral when georgie was eleven
georgie was reported to have differed with the undertaker about the seating of the family his indignant voice had become audible well who is the most important person at my own grandmother's funeral  and later he had projected his head from the window of the foremost mourners' carriage as the undertaker happened to pass
riffraff  there were peoplegrown people they werewho expressed themselves longingly they did hope to live to see the day they said when that boy would get his comeupance
they used that honest word so much better than deserts and not until many years later to be more clumsily rendered as what is coming to him something was bound to take him down some day and they only wanted to be there
but georgie heard nothing of this and the yearners for his taking down went unsatisfied while their yearning grew the greater as the happy day of fulfilment was longer and longer postponed
his grandeur was not diminished by the malloch smith story the rather it was increased and among other children especially among little girls there was added to the prestige of his gilded position that diabolical glamour which must inevitably attend a boy who has told a minister to go to hell
chapter iii    until he reached the age of twelve georgie's education was a domestic process tutors came to the house and those citizens who yearned for his taking down often said just wait till he has to go to public school then he'll get it but at twelve georgie was sent to a private school in the town and there came from this small and dependent institution no report or even rumour of georgie's getting anything that he was thought to deserve therefore the yearning still persisted though growing gaunt with feeding upon itself
for although georgie's pomposities and impudence in the little school were often almost unbearable the teachers were fascinated by him
they did not like himhe was too arrogant for thatbut he kept them in such a state of emotion that they thought more about him than they did about all of the other ten pupils
the emotion he kept them in was usually one resulting from injured selfrespect but sometimes it was dazzled admiration
so far as their conscientious observation went he studied his lessons sparingly but sometimes in class he flashed an admirable answer with a comprehension not often shown by the pupils they taught and he passed his examinations easily
in all without discernible effort he acquired at this school some rudiments of a liberal education and learned nothing whatever about himself
the yearners were still yearning when georgie at sixteen was sent away to a great prep school now they said brightly he'll get it
he'll find himself among boys just as important in their home towns as he is and they'll knock the stuffing out of him when he puts on his airs with them
oh but that would be worth something to see they were mistaken it appeared for when georgie returned a few months later he still seemed to have the same stuffing
he had been deported by the authorities the offense being stated as insolence and profanity in fact he had given the principal of the school instructions almost identical with those formerly objected to by the reverend malloch smith
but he had not got his comeupance and those who counted upon it were embittered by his appearance upon the downtown streets driving a dogcart at criminal speed making pedestrians retreat from the crossings and behaving generally as if he owned the earth a disgusted hardware dealer of middle age one of those who hungered for georgie's downfall was thus driven back upon the sidewalk to avoid being run over and so far forgot himself as to make use of the pet street insult of the year got 'ny sense
see here bub does your mother know you're out  georgie without even seeming to look at him flicked the long lash of his whip dexterously and a little spurt of dust came from the hardware man's trousers not far below the waist
he was not made of hardware he raved looking for a missile then finding none commanded himself sufficiently to shout after the rapid dogcart turn down your pants you wouldbe dude
raining in dear ole lunnon
git off the earth  georgie gave him no encouragement to think that he was heard
the dogcart turned the next corner causing indignation there likewise and having proceeded some distance farther halted in front of the amberson blockan oldfashioned fourstory brick warren of lawyers offices insurance and realestate offices with a drygoods store  occupying the ground floor
georgie tied his lathered trotter to a telegraph pole and stood for a moment looking at the building critically it seemed shabby and he thought his grandfather ought to replace it with a fourteenstory skyscraper or even a higher one such as he had lately seen in new yorkwhen he stopped there for a few days of recreation and rest on his way home from the bereaved school
about the entryway to the stairs were various tin signs announcing the occupation and location of upperfloor tenants and georgie decided to take some of these with him if he should ever go to college
however he did not stop to collect them at this time but climbed the worn stairsthere was no elevatorto the fourth floor went down a dark corridor and rapped three times upon a door
it was a mysterious door its upper half of opaque glass bearing no sign to state the business or profession of the occupants within but overhead upon the lintel four letters had been smearingly inscribed partly with purple ink and partly with a soft lead pencil f
o t a and upon the plaster wall above the lintel there was a drawing dear to male adolescence a skull and crossbones
three raps similar to georgie's sounded from within the room
georgie then rapped four times the rapper within the room rapped twice and georgie rapped seven times
this ended precautionary measures and a welldressed boy of sixteen opened the door whereupon georgie entered quickly and the door was closed behind him
seven boys of congenial age were seated in a semicircular row of damaged office chairs facing a platform whereon stood a solemn redhaired young personage with a table before him
at one end of the room there was a battered sideboard and upon it were some empty beer bottles a tobacco can about twothirds full with a web of mold over the surface of the tobacco a dusty cabinet photograph not inscribed of miss lillian russell several withered old pickles a caseknife and a halfpetrified section of icingcake on a sooty plate
at the other end of the room were two rickety cardtables and a stand of bookshelves where were displayed under dust four or five small volumes of m guy de maupassant's stories robinson crusoe sappho mr
barnes of new york a work by giovanni boccaccio a bible the arabian nights' entertainment  studies of the human form divine the little minister and a clutter of monthly magazines and illustrated weeklies of about that crispness one finds in such articles upon a doctor's anteroom table
upon the wall above the sideboard was an old framed lithograph of miss della fox in wang over the bookshelves there was another lithograph purporting to represent mr john l sullivan in a boxing costume and beside it a halftone reproduction of a reading from horner the final decoration consisted of damaged papiermachea round shield with two battleaxes and two crosshilted swords upon the wall over the little platform where stood the redhaired presiding officer
he addressed georgie in a serious voice  welcome friend of the ace  welcome friend of the ace georgie responded and all of the other boys repeated the words welcome friend of the ace  take your seat in the secret semicircle said the presiding officer
we will now proceed to  but georgie was disposed to be informal
he interrupted turning to the boy who had admitted him look here charlie johnson what's fred kinney doing in the president's chair
that's my place isn't it
what you men been up to here anyhow
didn't you all agree i was to be president just the same even if i was away at school  well said charlie johnson uneasily
listen
i didn't have much to do with it
some of the other members thought that long as you weren't in town or anything and fred gave the sideboard why  mr kinney presiding held in his hand in lieu of a gavel and considered much more impressive a civil war relic known as a horsepistol he rapped loudly for order
all friends of the ace will take their seats he said sharply
i'm president of the f o t a now george minafer and don't you forget it
you and charlie johnson sit down because i was elected perfectly fair and we're goin' to hold a meeting here  oh you are are you said george skeptically
charlie johnson thought to mollify him
well didn't we call this meeting just especially because you told us to
you said yourself we ought to have a kind of celebration because you've got back to town george and that's what we're here for now and everything
what do you care about being president
all it amounts to is just calling the roll and  the president de facto hammered the table
this meeting will now proceed to  no it won't said george and he advanced to the desk laughing contemptuously
get off that platform  this meeting will come to order mr kinney commanded fiercely
you put down that gavel said george
whose is it i'd like to know
it belongs to my grandfather and you quit hammering it that way or you'll break it and i'll have to knock your head off  this meeting will come to order
i was legally elected here and i'm not going to be bulldozed  all right said georgie
you're president
now we'll hold another election  we will not fred kinney shouted
we'll have our reg'lar meeting and then we'll play euchre  nickel a corner what we're here for
this meeting will now come to ord  georgie addressed the members
i'd like to know who got up this thing in the first place he said
who's the founder of the fota if you please
who got this room rent free
who got the janitor to let us have most of this furniture
you suppose you could keep this clubroom a minute if i told my grandfather i didn't want it for a literary club any more
i'd like to say a word on how you members been acting too
when i went away i said i didn't care if you had a vicepresident or something while i was gone but here i hardly turned my back and you had to go and elect fred kinney president
well if that's what you want you can have it
i was going to have a little celebration down here some night pretty soon and bring some port wine like we drink at school in our crowd there and i was going to get my grandfather to give the club an extra room across the hall and prob'ly i could get my uncle george to give us his old billiard table because he's got a new one and the club could put it in the other room
well you got a new president now here georgie moved toward the door and his tone became plaintive though undeniably there was disdain beneath his sorrow
i guess all i better do isresign  and he opened the door apparently intending to withdraw
all in favour of having a new election charlie johnson shouted hastily say 'aye'  aye was said by everyone present except mr kinney who began a hot protest but it was immediately smothered
all in favour of me being president instead of fred kinney shouted georgie say 'aye'
the 'ayes' have it   i resign said the redheaded boy gulping as he descended from the platform
i resign from the club  hoteyed he found his hat and departed jeers echoing after him as he plunged down the corridor
georgie stepped upon the platform and took up the emblem of office
ole redhead fred'll be around next week said the new chairman
he'll be around bootlickin' to get us to take him back in again but i guess we don't want him that fellow always was a troublemaker
we will now proceed with our meeting
well fellows i suppose you want to hear from your president
i don't know that i have much to say as i have already seen most of you a few times since i got back
i had a good time at the old school back east but had a little trouble with the faculty and came on home
my family stood by me as well as i could ask and i expect to stay right here in the old town until whenever i decide to enter college
now i don't suppose there's any more business before the meeting
i guess we might as well play cards
anybody that's game for a little quarterlimit poker or any limit they say why i'd like to have 'em sit at the president's cardtable  when the diversions of the friends of the ace were concluded for that afternoon georgie invited his chief supporter mr charlie johnson to drive home with him to dinner and as they jingled up national avenue in the dogcart charlie asked  what sort of men did you run up against at that school george  best crowd there finest set of men i ever met  how'd you get in with 'em  georgie laughed
i let them get in with me charlie he said in a tone of gentle explanation
it's vulgar to do any other way
did i tell you the nickname they gave me'king'
that was what they called me at that school 'king minafer  how'd they happen to do that his friend asked innocently
oh different things george answered lightly
of course any of 'em that came from anywhere out in this part the country knew about the family and all that and so i suppose it was a good deal on account ofoh on account of the family and the way i do things most likely     chapter iv   when mr george amberson minafer came home for the holidays at christmastide in his sophomore year probably no great change had taken place inside him but his exterior was visibly altered
nothing about him encouraged any hope that he had received his comeupance on the contrary the yearners for that stroke of justice must yearn even more itchingly the gilded youth's manner had become polite but his politeness was of a kind which democratic people found hard to bear
in a word m le due had returned from the gay life of the capital to show himself for a week among the loyal peasants belonging to the old chateau and their quaint habits and costumes afforded him a mild amusement
cards were out for a ball in his honour and this pageant of the tenantry was held in the ballroom of the amberson mansion the night after his arrival
it was as mrs henry franklin foster said of isabel's wedding a big ambersonstyle thing though that wise mrs henry franklin foster had long ago gone the way of all wisdom having stepped out of the midland town unquestionably into heavena long step but not beyond her powers
she had successors but no successor the town having grown too large to confess that it was intellectually led and literarily authoritated by one person and some of these successors were not invited to the ball for dimensions were now so metropolitan that intellectual leaders and literary authorities loomed in outlying regions unfamiliar to the ambersons
however all old citizens recognizable as gentry received cards and of course so did their dancing descendants
the orchestra and the caterer were brought from away in the amberson manner though this was really a gestureperhaps one more of habit than of ostentationfor servitors of gaiety as proficient as these importations were nowadays to be found in the town
even flowers and plants and roped vines were brought from afarnot however until the stock of the local florists proved insufficient to obliterate the interior structure of the big house in the amberson way
it was the last of the great long remembered dances that everybody talked aboutthere were getting to be so many people in town that no later than the next year there were too many for everybody to hear of even such a ball as the ambersons'
george whitegloved with a gardenia in his buttonhole stood with his mother and the major embowered in the big red and gold drawing room downstairs to receive the guests and standing thus together the trio offered a picturesque example of good looks persistent through three generations
the major his daughter and his grandson were of a type all amberson tall straight and regular with dark eyes short noses good chins and the grandfather's expression no less than the grandson's was one of faintly amused condescension
there was a difference however
the grandson's unlined young face had nothing to offer except this condescension the grandfather's had other things to say
it was a handsome worldly old face conscious of its importance but persuasive rather than arrogant and not without tokens of sufferings withstood
the major's short white hair was parted in the middle like his grandson's and in all he stood as briskly equipped to the fashion as exquisite young george
isabel standing between her father and her son caused a vague amazement in the mind of the latter
her age just under forty was for george a thought of something as remote as the moons of jupiter he could not possibly have conceived such an age ever coming to be his own five years was the limit of his thinking in time
five years ago he had been a child not yet fourteen and those five years were an abyss
five years hence he would be almost twentyfour what the girls he knew called one of the older men he could imagine himself at twentyfour but beyond that his powers staggered and refused the task
he saw little essential difference between thirtyeight and eightyeight and his mother was to him not a woman but wholly a mother
he had no perception of her other than as an adjunct to himself his mother nor could he imagine her thinking or doing anythingfalling in love walking with a friend or reading a bookas a woman and not as his mother
the woman isabel was a stranger to her son as completely a stranger as if he had never in his life seen her or heard her voice
and it was tonight while he stood with her receiving that he caught a disquieting glimpse of this stranger whom he thus fleetingly encountered for the first time
youth cannot imagine romance apart from youth
that is why the roles of the heroes and heroines of plays are given by the managers to the most youthful actors they can find among the competent
both middleaged people and young people enjoy a play about young lovers but only middleaged people will tolerate a play about middleaged lovers young people will not come to see such a play because for them middleaged lovers are a jokenot a very funny one
therefore to bring both the middleaged people and the young people into his house the manager makes his romance as young as he can
youth will indeed be served and its profound instinct is to be not only scornfully amused but vaguely angered by middleage romance
so standing beside his mother george was disturbed by a sudden impression coming upon him out of nowhere so far as he could detect that her eyes were brilliant that she was graceful and youthfulin a word that she was romantically lovely
he had one of those curious moments that seem to have neither a cause nor any connection with actual things
while it lasted he was disquieted not by thoughtsfor he had no definite thoughtsbut by a slight emotion like that caused in a dream by the presence of something invisible soundless and yet fantastic
there was nothing different or new about his mother except her new black and silver dress she was standing there beside him bending her head a little in her greetings smiling the same smile she had worn for the halfhour that people had been passing the receiving group
her face was flushed but the room was warm and shaking hands with so many people easily accounted for the pretty glow that was upon her
at any time she could have passed for twentyfive or twentysixa man of fifty would have honestly guessed her to be about thirty but possibly two or three years youngerand though extraordinary in this she had been extraordinary in it for years
there was nothing in either her looks or her manner to explain george's uncomfortable feeling and yet it increased becoming suddenly a vague resentment as if she had done something unmotherly to him
the fantastic moment passed and even while it lasted he was doing his duty greeting two pretty girls with whom he had grown up as people say and warmly assuring them that he remembered them very wellan assurance which might have surprised them in anybody but georgie minafer it seemed unnecessary since he had spent many hours with them no longer ago than the preceding august they had with them their parents and an uncle from out of town and george negligently gave the parents the same assurance he had given the daughters but murmured another form of greeting to the outoftown uncle whom he had never seen before
this person george absently took note of as a queerlooking duck undergraduates had not yet adopted bird it was a period previous to that in which a sophomore would have thought of the sharon girls' uncle as a queerlooking bird or perhaps a funnyface bird in george's time every human male was to be defined at pleasure as a duck but duck was not spoken with admiring affection as in its former feminine use to signify a dearon the contrary duck implied the speaker's personal detachment and humorous superiority
an indifferent amusement was what george felt when his mother with a gentle emphasis interrupted his interchange of courtesies with the nieces to present him to the queerlooking duck their uncle
this emphasis of isabel's though slight enabled george to perceive that she considered the queerlooking duck a person of some importance but it was far from enabling him to understand why
the duck parted his thick and longish black hair on the side his tie was a forgetful looking thing and his coat though it fitted a good enough middleaged figure no product of this year or of last year either
one of his eyebrows was noticeably higher than the other and there were whimsical lines between them which gave him an apprehensive expression but his apprehensions were evidently more humorous than profound for his prevailing look was that of a genial man of affairs not much afraid of anything whatever nevertheless observing only his unfashionable hair his eyebrows his preoccupied tie and his old coat the olympic george set him down as a queerlooking duck and having thus completed his portrait took no interest in him
the sharon girls passed on taking the queerlooking duck with them and george became pink with mortification as his mother called his attention to a whitebearded guest waiting to shake his hand
this was george's greatuncle old john minafer it was old john's boast that in spite of his connection by marriage with the ambersons he never had worn and never would wear a swallertail coat
members of his family had exerted their influence uselesslyat eightynine conservative people seldom form radical new habits and old john wore his sunday suit of black broadcloth to the amberson ball
the coat was square with skirts to the knees old john called it a prince albert and was well enough pleased with it but his greatnephew considered it the next thing to an insult
george's purpose had been to ignore the man but he had to take his hand for a moment whereupon old john began to tell george that he was looking well though there had been a time during his fourth month when he was so puny that nobody thought he would live
the greatnephew in a fury of blushes dropped old john's hand with some vigour and seized that of the next person in the line
member you v'ry well 'ndeed he said fiercely
the large room had filled and so had the broad hall and the rooms on the other side of the hall where there were tables for whist
the imported orchestra waited in the ballroom on the third floor but a local harp 'cello violin and flute were playing airs from the fencing master in the hall and people were shouting over the music
old john minafer's voice was louder and more penetrating than any other because he had been troubled with deafness for twentyfive years heard his own voice but faintly and liked to hear it
smell o' flowers like this always puts me in mind o' funerals he kept telling his niece fanny minafer who was with him and he seemed to get a great deal of satisfaction out of this reminder
his tremulous yet strident voice cut through the voluminous sound that filled the room and he was heard everywhere always got to think o' funerals when i smell so many flowers and as the pressure of people forced fanny and himself against the white marble mantelpiece he pursued this train of cheery thought shouting right here's where the major's wife was laid out at her funeral
they had her in a good light from that big bow window  he paused to chuckle mournfully
i s'pose that's where they'll put the major when his time comes  presently george's mortification was increased to hear this sawmill droning harshly from the midst of the thickening crowd ain't the dancin' broke out yet fanny
hoopla
le's push through and go see the young womenfolks crack their heels
start the circus
hoopsedaisy  miss fanny minafer in charge of the lively veteran was almost as distressed as her nephew george but she did her duty and managed to get old john through the press and out to the broad stairway which numbers of young people were now ascending to the ballroom
and here the sawmill voice still rose over all others solid black walnut every inch of it balustrades and all
sixty thousand dollars' worth o' carved woodwork in the house
like water
spent money like water
always did
still do
like water
god knows where it all comes from  he continued the ascent barking and coughing among the gleaming young heads white shoulders jewels and chiffon like an old dog slowly swimming up the rapids of a sparkling river while down below in the drawing room george began to recover from the degradation into which this relic of early settler days had dragged him
what restored him completely was a darkeyed little beauty of nineteen very knowing in lustrous blue and jet at sight of this dashing advent in the line of guests before him george was fully an amberson again
remember you very well indeed he said his graciousness more earnest than any he had heretofore displayed
isabel heard him and laughed
but you don't george she said
you don't remember her yet though of course you will
miss morgan is from out of town and i'm afraid this is the first time you've ever seen her
you might take her up to the dancing i think you've pretty well done your duty here  be d'lighted george responded formally and offered his arm not with a flourish certainly but with an impressiveness inspired partly by the appearance of the person to whom he offered it partly by his being the hero of this fete and partly by his youthfulnessfor when manners are new they are apt to be elaborate
the little beauty entrusted her gloved fingers to his coatsleeve and they moved away together
their progress was necessarily slow and to george's mind it did not lack stateliness
how could it
musicians hired especially for him were sitting in a grove of palms in the hall and now tenderly playing oh promise me for his pleasuring dozens and scores of flowers had been brought to life and tended to this hour that they might sweeten the air for him while they died and the evanescent power that music and floral scents hold over youth stirred his appreciation of strange beautiful qualities within his own bosom he seemed to himself to be mysteriously angelic and about to do something which would overwhelm the beautiful young stranger upon his arm
elderly people and middleaged people moved away to let him pass with his honoured fair beside him
worthy middleclass creatures they seemed leading dull lives but appreciative of better things when they saw themand george's bosom was fleetingly touched with a pitying kindness
and since the primordial day when caste or heritage first set one person in his own esteem above his fellowbeings it is to be doubted if anybody ever felt more illustrious or more negligently grand than george amberson minafer felt at this party
as he conducted miss morgan through the hall toward the stairway they passed the open double doors of a card room where some squadrons of older people were preparing for action and leaning gracefully upon the mantelpiece of this room a tall man handsome highmannered and sparklingly pointdevice held laughing converse with that queerlooking duck the sharon girls' uncle
the tall gentleman waved a gracious salutation to george and miss morgan's curiosity was stirred
who is that  i didn't catch his name when my mother presented him to me said george
you mean the queerlooking duck  i mean the aristocratic duck  that's my uncle george honourable george amberson
i thought everybody knew him  he looks as though everybody ought to know him she said
it seems to run in your family  if she had any sly intention it skipped over george harmlessly
well of course i suppose most everybody does he admittedout in this part of the country especially
besides uncle george is in congress the family like to have someone there  why  well it's sort of a good thing in one way
for instance my uncle sydney amberson and his wife aunt amelia they haven't got much of anything to do with themselvesget bored to death around here of course
well probably uncle george'll have uncle sydney appointed minister or ambassador or something like that to russia or italy or somewhere and that'll make it pleasant when any of the rest of the family go travelling or things like that
i expect to do a good deal of travelling myself when i get out of college  on the stairway he pointed out this prospective ambassadorial couple sydney and amelia
they were coming down fronting the ascending tide and as conspicuous over it as a king and queen in a play
moreover as the cleareyed miss morgan remarked the very least they looked was ambassadorial
sydney was an amberson exaggerated more pompous than gracious too portly flushed starched to a shine his stately jowl furnished with an edward the seventh beard
amelia likewise fullbodied showed glittering blond hair exuberantly dressed a pink fat face cold under a whitehot tiara a solid cold bosom under a whitehot necklace great cold gloved arms and the rest of her beautifully upholstered
amelia was an amberson born herself sydney's secondcousin they had no children and sydney was without a business or a profession thus both found a great deal of time to think about the appropriateness of their becoming excellencies
and as george ascended the broad stairway they were precisely the aunt and uncle he was most pleased to point out to a girl from out of town as his appurtenances in the way of relatives
at sight of them the grandeur of the amberson family was instantly conspicuous as a permanent thing it was impossible to doubt that the ambersons were entrenched in their nobility and riches behind polished and glittering barriers which were as solid as they were brilliant and would last
chapter v    the hero of the fete with the darkeyed little beauty upon his arm reached the top of the second flight of stairs and here beyond a spacious landing where two proudlike darkies tended a crystalline punch bowl four wide archways in a rosevine lattice framed gliding silhouettes of waltzers already smoothly at it to the castanets of la paloma old john minafer evidently surfeited was in the act of leaving these delights
d'want 'ny more o' that he barked
just slidin' around
call that dancin'
rather see a jig any day in the world
they ain't very modest some of 'em
i don't mind that though
not me  miss fanny minafer was no longer in charge of him he emerged from the ballroom escorted by a middleaged man of commonplace appearance
the escort had a dry lined face upon which not ornamentally but as a matter of course there grew a business man's short moustache and his thin neck showed an adam's apple but not conspicuously for there was nothing conspicuous about him
baldish dim quiet he was an unnoticeable part of this festival and although there were a dozen or more middleaged men present not casually to be distinguished from him in general aspect he was probably the last person in the big house at whom a stranger would have glanced twice
it did not enter george's mind to mention to miss morgan that this was his father or to say anything whatever about him
mr minafer shook his son's hand unobtrusively in passing
i'll take uncle john home he said in a low voice
then i guess i'll go on home myselfi'm not a great hand at parties you know
goodnight george  george murmured a friendly enough goodnight without pausing
ordinarily he was not ashamed of the minafers he seldom thought about them at all for he belonged as most american children do to the mother's familybut he was anxious not to linger with miss morgan in the vicinity of old john whom he felt to be a disgrace
he pushed brusquely through the fringe of calculating youths who were gathered in the arches watching for chances to dance only with girls who would soon be taken off their hands and led his stranger lady out upon the floor
they caught the time instantly and were away in the waltz
george danced well and miss morgan seemed to float as part of the music the very dove itself of la paloma they said nothing as they danced her eyes were cast down all the whilethe prettiest gesture for a dancerand there was left in the universe for each of them only their companionship in this waltz while the faces of the other dancers swimming by denoted not people but merely blurs of colour
george became conscious of strange feelings within him an exaltation of soul tender but indefinite and seemingly located in the upper part of his diaphragm
the stopping of the music came upon him like the waking to an alarm clock for instantly six or seven of the calculating persons about the entryways bore down upon miss morgan to secure dances
george had to do with one already established as a belle it seemed
give me the next and the one after that he said hurriedly recovering some presence of mind just as the nearest applicant reached them
and give me every third one the rest of the evening  she laughed
are you asking  what do you mean 'asking'  it sounded as though you were just telling me to give you all those dances  well i want 'em george insisted
what about all the other girls it's your duty to dance with  they'll have to go without he said heartlessly and then with surprising vehemence here
i want to know are you going to give me those  good gracious she laughed
yes  the applicants flocked round her urging contracts for what remained but they did not dislodge george from her side though he made it evident that they succeeded in annoying him and presently he extricated her from an accumulating siegeshe must have connived in the extricationand bore her off to sit beside him upon the stairway that led to the musicians' gallery where they were sufficiently retired yet had a view of the room
how'd all those ducks get to know you so quick george inquired with little enthusiasm
oh i've been here a week  looks as if you'd been pretty busy he said
most of those ducks i don't know what my mother wanted to invite 'em here for  oh i used to see something of a few of 'em
i was president of a club we had here and some of 'em belonged to it but i don't care much for that sort of thing any more
i really don't see why my mother invited 'em  perhaps it was on account of their parents miss morgan suggested mildly
maybe she didn't want to offend their fathers and mothers  oh hardly
i don't think my mother need worry much about offending anybody in this old town  it must be wonderful said miss morgan
it must be wonderful mr ambersonmr minafer i mean  what must be wonderful  to be so important as that  that isn't 'important george assured her
anybody that really is anybody ought to be able to do about as they like in their own town i should think  she looked at him critically from under her shading lashesbut her eyes grew gentler almost at once
in truth they became more appreciative than critical
george's imperious good looks were altogether manly yet approached actual beauty as closely as a boy's good looks should dare and dancemusic and flowers have some effect upon nineteenyearold girls as well as upon eighteenyearold boys
miss morgan turned her eyes slowly from george and pressed her face among the liliesofthevalley and violets of the pretty bouquet she carried while from the gallery above the music of the next dance carolled out merrily in a new twostep
the musicians made the melody gay for the christmastime with chimes of sleighbells and the entrance to the shadowed stairway framed the passing flushed and lively dancers but neither george nor miss morgan suggested moving to join the dance
the stairway was draughty the steps were narrow and uncomfortable no older person would have remained in such a place
moreover these two young people were strangers to each other neither had said anything in which the other had discovered the slightest intrinsic interest there had not arisen between them the beginnings of congeniality or even of friendlinessbut stairways near ballrooms have more to answer for than have moonlit lakes and mountain sunsets
some day the laws of glamour must be discovered because they are so important that the world would be wiser now if sir isaac newton had been hit on the head not by an apple but by a young lady
age confused by its own long accumulation of follies is everlastingly inquiring what does she see in him as if young love came about through thinkingor through conduct
age wants to know what on earth can they talk about as if talking had anything to do with april rains
at seventy one gets up in the morning finds the air sweet under a bright sun feels lively thinks i am hearty today and plans to go for a drive
at eighteen one goes to a dance sits with a stranger on a stairway feels peculiar thinks nothing and becomes incapable of any plan whatever
miss morgan and george stayed where they were
they had agreed to this in silence and without knowing it certainly without exchanging glances of intelligencethey had exchanged no glances at all
both sat staring vaguely out into the ballroom and for a time they did not speak
over their heads the music reached a climax of vivacity drums cymbals triangle and sleighbells beating clashing tinkling
here and there were to be seen couples so carried away that ceasing to move at the decorous even glide considered most knowing they pranced and whirled through the throng from wall to wall galloping bounteously in abandon
george suffered a shock of vague surprise when he perceived that his aunt fanny minafer was the ladyhalf of one of these wild couples
fanny minafer who rouged a little was like fruit which in some climates dries with the bloom on
her features had remained prettily childlike so had her figure and there were times when strangers seeing her across the street took her to be about twenty they were other times when at the same distance they took her to be about sixty instead of forty as she was
she had old days and young days old hours and young hours old minutes and young minutes for the change might be that quick
an alteration in her expression or a difference in the attitude of her head would cause astonishing indentations to appearand behold fanny was an old lady
but she had been never more childlike than she was tonight as she flew over the floor in the capable arms of the queerlooking duck for this person was her partner
the queerlooking duck had been a real dancer in his day it appeared and evidently his day was not yet over
in spite of the headlong gay rapidity with which he bore miss fanny about the big room he danced authoritatively avoiding without effort the lightest collision with other couples maintaining sufficient grace throughout his wildest moments and all the while laughing and talking with his partner
what was most remarkable to george and a little irritating this stranger in the amberson mansion had no vestige of the air of deference proper to a stranger in such a place he seemed thoroughly at home
he seemed offensively so indeed when passing the entrance to the gallery stairway he disengaged his hand from miss fanny's for an instant and not pausing in the dance waved a laughing salutation more than cordial then capered lightly out of sight
george gazed stonily at this manifestation responding neither by word nor sign
how's that for a bit of freshness he murmured
what was miss morgan asked
that queerlooking duck waving his hand at me like that
except he's the sharon girls' uncle i don't know him from adam  you don't need to she said
he wasn't waving his hand to you he meant me  oh he did george was not mollified by the explanation
everybody seems to mean you
you certainly do seem to've been pretty busy this week you've been here  she pressed her bouquet to her face again and laughed into it not displeased
she made no other comment and for another period neither spoke
meanwhile the music stopped loud applause insisted upon its renewal an encore was danced there was an interlude of voices and the changing of partners began
well said george finally i must say you don't seem to be much of a prattler
they say it's a great way to get a reputation for being wise never saying much
don't you ever talk any  when people can understand she answered
he had been looking moodily out at the ballroom but he turned to her quickly at this saw that her eyes were sunny and content over the top of her bouquet and he consented to smile
girls are usually pretty fresh he said
they ought to go to a man's college about a year they'd get taught a few things about freshness
what you got to do after two o'clock tomorrow afternoon  a whole lot of things
every minute filled up  all right said george
the snow's fine for sleighing i'll come for you in a cutter at ten minutes after two  i can't possibly go  if you don't he said i'm going to sit in the cutter in front of the gate wherever you're visiting all afternoon and if you try to go out with anybody else he's got to whip me before he gets you and as she laughedthough she blushed a little toohe continued seriously if you think i'm not in earnest you're at liberty to make quite a big experiment  she laughed again
i don't think i've often had so large a compliment as that she said especially on such short noticeand yet i don't think i'll go with you
you be ready at ten minutes after two  no i won't  yes you will  yes she said i will and her partner for the next dance arrived breathless with searching
don't forget i've got the third from now george called after her
i won't  and every third one after that  i know she called over her partner's shoulder and her voice was amusedbut meek
when the third from now came george presented himself before her without any greeting like a brother or a mannerless old friend
neither did she greet him but moved away with him concluding as she went an exchange of badinage with the preceding partner she had been talkative enough with him it appeared
in fact both george and miss morgan talked much more to every one else that evening than to each other and they said nothing at all at this time
both looked preoccupied as they began to dance and preserved a gravity of expression to the end of the number
and when the third one after that  came they did not dance but went back to the gallery stairway seeming to have reached an understanding without any verbal consultation that this suburb was again the place for them
well said george coolly when they were seated what did you say your name was  morgan  funny name  everybody else's name always is  i didn't mean it was really funny george explained
that's just one of my crowd's bits of horsing at college
we always say 'funny name' no matter what it is
i guess we're pretty fresh sometimes but i knew your name was morgan because my mother said so downstairs
i meant what's the rest of it  lucy  he was silent
is 'lucy' a funny name too she inquired
no
lucy's very much all right he said and he went so far as to smile
even his aunt fanny admitted that when george smiled in a certain way he was charming
thanks about letting my name be lucy she said
how old are you george asked
i don't really know myself  what do you mean you don't really know yourself  i mean i only know what they tell me
i believe them of course but believing isn't really knowing
you believe some certain day is your birthdayat least i suppose you dobut you don't really know it is because you can't remember  look here said george
do you always talk like this  miss lucy morgan laughed forgivingly put her young head on one side like a bird and responded cheerfully i'm willing to learn wisdom
what are you studying in school  college  at the university
yes
what are you studying there  george laughed
lot o' useless guff  then why don't you study some useful guff  what do you mean 'useful'  something you'd use later in your business or profession  george waved his hand impatiently
i don't expect to go into any 'business or profession  no  certainly not george was emphatic being sincerely annoyed by a suggestion which showed how utterly she failed to comprehend the kind of person he was
why not she asked mildly
just look at 'em he said almost with bitterness and he made a gesture presumably intended to indicate the business and professional men now dancing within range of vision
that's a fine career for a man isn't it
lawyers bankers politicians
what do they get out of life i'd like to know
what do they ever know about real things
where do they ever get  he was so earnest that she was surprised and impressed
evidently he had deepseated ambitions for he seemed to speak with actual emotion of these despised things which were so far beneath his planning for the future
she had a vague momentary vision of pitt at twentyone prime minister of england and she spoke involuntarily in a lowered voice with deference  what do you want to be she asked
george answered promptly
a yachtsman he said
chapter vi    having thus in a word revealed his ambition for a career above courts marts and polling booths george breathed more deeply than usual and turning his face from the lovely companion whom he had just made his confidant gazed out at the dancers with an expression in which there was both sternness and a contempt for the squalid lives of the unyachted midlanders before him
however among them he marked his mother and his sombre grandeur relaxed momentarily a more genial light came into his eyes
isabel was dancing with the queerlooking duck and it was to be noted that the lively gentleman's gait was more sedate than it had been with miss fanny minafer but not less dexterous and authoritative
he was talking to isabel as gaily as he had talked to miss fanny though with less laughter and isabel listened and answered eagerly her colour was high and her eyes had a look of delight
she saw george and the beautiful lucy on the stairway and nodded to them
george waved his hand vaguely he had a momentary return of that inexplicable uneasiness and resentment which had troubled him downstairs
how lovely your mother is lucy said  i think she is he agreed gently
she's the gracefulest woman in that ballroom
she dances like a girl of sixteen  most girls of sixteen said george are bum dancers
anyhow i wouldn't dance with one unless i had to  well you'd better dance with your mother
i never saw anybody lovelier
how wonderfully they dance together  who  your mother andand the queerlooking duck said lucy
i'm going to dance with him pretty soon  i don't careso long as you don't give him one of the numbers that belong to me  i'll try to remember she said and thoughtfully lifted to her face the bouquet of violets and lilies a gesture which george noted without approval
look here
who sent you those flowers you keep makin' such a fuss over  he did  who's 'he'  the queerlooking duck  george feared no such rival he laughed loudly
i s'pose he's some old widower he said the object thus described seeming ignominious enough to a person of eighteen without additional characterization
some old widower  lucy became serious at once
yes he is a widower she said
i ought to have told you before he's my father  george stopped laughing abruptly
well that's a horse on me
if i'd known he was your father of course i wouldn't have made fun of him
i'm sorry  nobody could make fun of him she said quietly
why couldn't they  it wouldn't make him funny it would only make themselves silly  upon this george had a gleam of intelligence
well i'm not going to make myself silly any more then i don't want to take chances like that with you
but i thought he was the sharon girls' uncle
he came with them  yes she said i'm always late to everything i wouldn't let them wait for me
we're visiting the sharons  about time i knew that
you forget my being so fresh about your father will you
of course he's a distinguished looking man in a way  lucy was still serious
in a way
' she repeated
you mean not in your way don't you  george was perplexed
how do you mean not in my way  people pretty often say 'in a way' and 'rather distinguished looking' or 'rather' soandso or 'rather' anything to show that they're superior don't they
in new york last month i overheard a climber sort of woman speaking of me as 'little miss morgan' but she didn't mean my height she meant that she was important
her husband spoke of a friend of mine as 'little mr pembroke' and 'little mr pembroke' is sixfeetthree
this husband and wife were really so terribly unimportant that the only way they knew to pretend to be important was calling people 'little' miss or mister soandso
it's a kind of snob slang i think
of course people don't always say 'rather' or 'in a way' to be superior  i should say not
i use both of 'em a great deal myself said george
one thing i don't see though what's the use of a man being sixfeetthree
men that size can't handle themselves as well as a man about fivefeeteleven and a half can
those long gangling men they're nearly always too kind of wormy to be any good in athletics and they're so awkward they keep falling over chairs or  mr
pembroke is in the army said lucy primly
he's extraordinarily graceful  in the army
oh i suppose he's some old friend of your father's  they got on very well she said after i introduced them  george was a straightforward soul at least
see here he said
are you engaged to anybody  no  not wholly mollified he shrugged his shoulders
you seem to know a good many people
do you live in new york  no
we don't live anywhere  what you mean you don't live anywhere  we've lived all over she answered
papa used to live here in this town but that was before i was born  what do you keep moving around so for
is he a promoter  no
he's an inventor  what's he invented  just lately said lucy he's been working on a new kind of horseless carriage  well i'm sorry for him george said in no unkindly spirit
those things are never going to amount to anything
people aren't going to spend their lives lying on their backs in the road and letting grease drip in their faces
horseless carriages are pretty much a failure and your father better not waste his time on 'em  papa'd be so grateful she returned if he could have your advice  instantly george's face became flushed
i don't know that i've done anything to be insulted for he said
i don't see that what i said was particularly fresh  no indeed  then what do you  she laughed gaily
i don't
and i don't mind your being such a lofty person at all
i think it's ever so interestingbut papa's a great man  is he george decided to be goodnatured well let us hope so
i hope so i'm sure  looking at him keenly she saw that the magnificent youth was incredibly sincere in this bit of graciousness
he spoke as a tolerant elderly statesman might speak of a promising young politician and with her eyes still upon him lucy shook her head in gentle wonder
i'm just beginning to understand she said
understand what  what it means to be a real amberson in this town
papa told me something about it before we came but i see he didn't say half enough  george superbly took this all for tribute
did your father say he knew the family before he left here  yes
i believe he was particularly a friend of your uncle george and he didn't say so but i imagine he must have known your mother very well too
he wasn't an inventor then he was a young lawyer
the town was smaller in those days and i believe he was quite well known  i dare say
i've no doubt the family are all very glad to see him back especially if they used to have him at the house a good deal as he told you  i don't think he meant to boast of it she said he spoke of it quite calmly  george stared at her for a moment in perplexity then perceiving that her intention was satirical girls really ought to go to a man's college he saidjust a month or two anyhow it'd take some of the freshness out of 'em  i can't believe it she retorted as her partner for the next dance arrived
it would only make them a little politer on the surfacethey'd be really just as awful as ever after you got to know them a few minutes  what do you mean 'after you got to know them a'  she was departing to the dance
janie and mary sharon told me all about what sort of a little boy you were she said over her shoulder
you must think it out she took wing away on the breeze of the waltz and george having stared gloomily after her for a few moments postponed filling an engagement and strolled round the fluctuating outskirts of the dance to where his uncle george amberson stood smilingly watching under one of the rosevine arches at the entrance to the room
hello young namesake said the uncle
why lingers the laggard heel of the dancer
haven't you got a partner  she's sitting around waiting for me somewhere said george
see here who is this fellow morgan that aunt fanny minafer was dancing with a while  amberson laughed
he's a man with a pretty daughter georgie
meseemed you've been spending the evening noticing something of that sortor do i err  never mind
what sort is he  i think we'll have to give him a character georgie
he's an old friend used to practice law hereperhaps he had more debts than cases but he paid 'em all up before he left town
your question is purely mercenary i take it you want to know his true worth before proceeding further with the daughter
i cannot inform you though i notice signs of considerable prosperity in that becoming dress of hers
however you never can tell it is an age when every sacrifice is made for the young and how your own poor mother managed to provide those genuine pearl studs for you out of her allowance from father i can't  oh dry up said the nephew
i understand this morgan  mr
eugene morgan his uncle suggested
politeness requires that the young should  i guess the 'young' didn't know much about politeness in your day  george interrupted
i understand that mr eugene morgan used to be a great friend of the family  oh the minafers the uncle inquired with apparent innocence
no i seem to recall that he and your father were not  i mean the ambersons george said impatiently
i understand he was a good deal around the house here  what is your objection to that george  what do you mean my objection  you seemed to speak with a certain crossness  well said george i meant he seems to feel awfully at home here
the way he was dancing with aunt fanny  amberson laughed
i'm afraid your aunt fanny's heart was stirred by ancient recollections georgie  you mean she used to be silly about him  she wasn't considered singular said the uncle he washe was popular
could you bear a question  what do you mean could i bear  i only wanted to ask do you take this same passionate interest in the parents of every girl you dance with
perhaps it's a new fashion we old bachelors ought to take up
is it the thing this year to  oh go on said george moving away
i only wanted to know he left the sentence unfinished and crossed the room to where a girl sat waiting for his nobility to find time to fulfil his contract with her for this dance
pardon f' keep' wait he muttered as she rose brightly to meet him and she seemed pleased that he came at allbut george was used to girls' looking radiant when he danced with them and she had little effect upon him
he danced with her perfunctorily thinking the while of mr eugene morgan and his daughter
strangely enough his thoughts dwelt more upon the father than the daughter though george could not possibly have given a reasoneven to himselffor this disturbing preponderance
by a coincidence though not an odd one the thoughts and conversation of mr eugene morgan at this very time were concerned with george amberson minafer rather casually it is true
mr morgan had retired to a room set apart for smoking on the second floor and had found a grizzled gentleman lounging in solitary possession
'gene morgan this person exclaimed rising with great heartiness
i'd heard you were in towni don't believe you know me  yes i do fred kinney mr morgan returned with equal friendliness
your real facethe one i used to knowit's just underneath the one you're masquerading in tonight
you ought to have changed it more if you wanted a disguise  twenty years said mr kinney
it makes some difference in faces but more in behaviour  it does so his friend agreed with explosive emphasis
my own behaviour began to be different about that long agoquite suddenly  i remember said mr kinney sympathetically
well life's odd enough as we look back  probably it's going to be odder stillif we could look forward  probably  they sat and smoked
however mr morgan remarked presently i still dance like an indian
don't you  no
i leave that to my boy fred
he does the dancing for the family  i suppose he's upstairs hard at it  no he's not here mr kinney glanced toward the open door and lowered his voice
he wouldn't come
it seems that a couple of years or so ago he had a row with young georgie minafer
fred was president of a literary club they had and he said this young georgie got himself elected instead in an overbearing sort of way
fred's redheaded you knowi suppose you remember his mother
you were at the wedding  i remember the wedding said mr morgan
and i remember your bachelor dinnermost of it that is  well my boy fred's as redheaded now mr kinney went on as his mother was then and he's very bitter about his row with georgie minafer
he says he'd rather burn his foot off than set it inside any amberson house or any place else where young georgie is
fact is the boy seemed to have so much feeling over it i had my doubts about coming myself but my wife said it was all nonsense we mustn't humour fred in a grudge over such a little thing and while she despised that georgie minafer herself as much as any one else did she wasn't going to miss a big amberson show just on account of a boys' rumpus and so on and so on and so we came  do people dislike young minafer generally  i don't know about 'generally'
i guess he gets plenty of toadying but there's certainly a lot of people that are glad to express their opinions about him  what's the matter with him  too much amberson i suppose for one thing
and for another his mother just fell down and worshipped him from the day he was born that's what beats me
i don't have to tell you what isabel amberson is eugene morgan
she's got a touch of the amberson high stuff about her but you can't get anybody that ever knew her to deny that she's just about the finest woman in the world  no said eugene morgan
you can't get anybody to deny that  then i can't see how she doesn't see the truth about that boy
he thinks he's a little tin god on wheelsand honestly it makes some people weak and sick just to think about him
yet that highspirited intelligent woman isabel amberson actually sits and worships him
you can hear it in her voice when she speaks to him or speaks of him
you can see it in her eyes when she looks at him
my lord
what does she see when she looks at him  morgan's odd expression of genial apprehension deepened whimsically though it denoted no actual apprehension whatever and cleared away from his face altogether when he smiled he became surprisingly winning and persuasive when he smiled
he smiled now after a moment at this question of his old friend
she sees something that we don't see he said
what does she see  an angel  kinney laughed aloud
well if she sees an angel when she looks at georgie minafer she's a funnier woman than i thought she was  perhaps she is said morgan
but that's what she sees  my lord
it's easy to see you've only known him an hour or so
in that time have you looked at georgie and seen an angel  no
all i saw was a remarkably goodlooking foolboy with the pride of satan and a set of nice new drawingroom manners that he probably couldn't use more than half an hour at a time without busting  then what  mothers are right said morgan
do you think this young george is the same sort of creature when he's with his mother that he is when he's bulldozing your boy fred
mothers see the angel in us because the angel is there
if it's shown to the mother the son has got an angel to show hasn't he
when a son cuts somebody's throat the mother only sees it's possible for a misguided angel to act like a deviland she's entirely right about that  kinney laughed and put his hand on his friend's shoulder
i remember what a fellow you always were to argue he said
you mean georgie minafer is as much of an angel as any murderer is and that georgie's mother is always right  i'm afraid she always has been morgan said lightly
the friendly hand remained upon his shoulder
she was wrong once old fellow
at least so it seemed to me  no said morgan a little awkwardly
no  kinney relieved the slight embarrassment that had come upon both of them he laughed again
wait till you know young georgie a little better he said
something tells me you're going to change your mind about his having an angel to show if you see anything of him  you mean beauty's in the eye of the beholder and the angel is all in the eye of the mother
if you were a painter fred you'd paint mothers with angels' eyes holding imps in their laps
me
i'll stick to the old masters and the cherubs  mr kinney looked at him musingly
somebody's eyes must have been pretty angelic he said if they've been persuading you that georgie minnafer is a cherub  they are said morgan heartily
they're more angelic than ever and as a new flourish of music sounded overhead he threw away his cigarette and jumped up briskly
goodbye i've got this dance with her  with whom  with isabel  the grizzled mr kinney affected to rub his eyes
it startles me your jumping up like that to go and dance with isabel amberson
twenty years seem to have passedbut have they
tell me have you danced with poor old fanny too this evening  twice  my lord kinney groaned half in earnest
old times starting all over again
my lord  old times morgan laughed gaily from the doorway
not a bit
there aren't any old times
when times are gone they're not old they're dead
there aren't any times but new times  and he vanished in such a manner that he seemed already to have begun dancing
chapter vii    the appearance of miss lucy morgan the next day as she sat in george's fast cutter proved so charming that her escort was stricken to soft words instantly and failed to control a poetic impulse
her rich little hat was trimmed with black fur her hair was almost as dark as the fur a great boa of black fur was about her shoulders her hands were vanished into a black muff and george's laprobe was black
you look like he said
your face looks likeit looks like a snowflake on a lump of coal
i mean aa snowflake that would be a roseleaf too  perhaps you'd better look at the reins she returned
we almost upset just then  george declined to heed this advice
because there's too much pink in your cheeks for a snowflake he continued
what's that fairy story about snowwhite and rosered  we're going pretty fast mr minafer  well you see i'm only here for two weeks  i mean the sleigh she explained
we're not the only people on the street you know  oh they'll keep out of the way  that's very patrician charioteering but it seems to me a horse like this needs guidance
i'm sure he's going almost twenty miles an hour  that's nothing said george but he consented to look forward again
he can trot under three minutes all right he laughed
i suppose your father thinks he can build a horseless carriage to go that fast  they go that fast already sometimes  yes said george they dofor about a hundred feet
then they give a yell and burn up  evidently she decided not to defend her father's faith in horseless carriages for she laughed and said nothing
the cold air was polkadotted with snowflakes and trembled to the loud continuous jingling of sleighbells
boys and girls all aglow and panting jets of vapour darted at the passing sleighs to ride on the runners or sought to rope their sleds to any vehicle whatever but the fleetest no more than just touched the flying cutter though a hundred soggy mittens grasped for it then reeled and whirled till sometimes the wearers of those daring mittens plunged flat in the snow and lay asprawl reflecting
for this was the holiday time and all the boys and girls in town were out most of them on national avenue
but there came panting and chugging up that flat thoroughfare a thing which some day was to spoil all their sleightime merrimentsave for the rashest and most disobedient
it was vaguely like a topless surry but cumbrous with unwholesome excrescences fore and aft while underneath were spinning leather belts and something that whirred and howled and seemed to stagger
the ridestealers made no attempt to fasten their sleds to a contrivance so nonsensical and yet so fearsome
instead they gave over their sport and concentrated all their energies in their lungs so that up and down the street the one cry shrilled increasingly git a hoss
git a hoss
git a hoss
mister why don't you git a hoss but the mahout in charge sitting solitary on the front seat was unconcernedhe laughed and now and then ducked a snowball without losing any of his goodnature
it was mr eugene morgan who exhibited so cheerful a countenance between the forward visor of a deerstalker cap and the collar of a fuzzy gray ulster
git a hoss  the children shrieked and gruffer voices joined them
git a hoss
git a hoss
git a hoss  george minafer was correct thus far the twelve miles an hour of such a machine would never overtake george's trotter
the cutter was already scurrying between the stone pillars at the entrance to amberson addition
that's my grandfather's said george nodding toward the amberson mansion
i ought to know that lucy exclaimed
we stayed there late enough last night papa and i were almost the last to go
he and your mother and miss fanny minafer got the musicians to play another waltz when everybody else had gone downstairs and the fiddles were being put away in their cases
papa danced part of it with miss minafer and the rest with your mother
miss minafer's your aunt isn't she  yes she lives with us
i tease her a good deal  what about  oh anything handywhatever's easy to tease an old maid about  doesn't she mind  she usually has sort of a grouch on me laughed george
nothing much
that's our house just beyond grandfather's he waved a sealskin gauntlet to indicate the house major amberson had built for isabel as a wedding gift
it's almost the same as grandfather's only not as large and hasn't got a regular ballroom
we gave the dance last night at grandfather's on account of the ballroom and because i'm the only grandchild you know
of course some day that'll be my house though i expect my mother will most likely go on living where she does now with father and aunt fanny
i suppose i'll probably build a country house toosomewhere east i guess he stopped speaking and frowned as they passed a closed carriage and pair
the body of this comfortable vehicle sagged slightly to one side the paint was old and seamed with hundreds of minute cracks like little rivers on a black map the coachman a fat and elderly darky seemed to drowse upon the box but the open window afforded the occupants of the cutter a glimpse of a tired fine old face a silk hat a pearl tie and an astrachan collar evidently out to take the air
there's your grandfather now said lucy
isn't it  george's frown was not relaxed
yes it is and he ought to give that rattrap away and sell those old horses
they're a disgrace all shaggynot even clipped
i suppose he doesn't notice itpeople get awful funny when they get old they seem to lose their selfrespect sort of  he seemed a real brummell to me she said
oh he keeps up about what he wears well enough butwell look at that he pointed to a statue of minerva one of the castiron sculptures major amberson had set up in opening the addition years before
minerva was intact but a blackish streak descended unpleasantly from her forehead to the point of her straight nose and a few other streaks were sketched in a repellent dinge upon the folds of her drapery
that must be from soot said lucy
there are so many houses around here  anyhow somebody ought to see that these statues are kept clean
my grandfather owns a good many of these houses i guess for renting
of course he sold most of the lotsthere aren't any vacant ones and there used to be heaps of 'em when i was a boy
another thing i don't think he ought to allow a good many of these people bought big lots and they built houses on 'em then the price of the land kept getting higher and they'd sell part of their yards and let the people that bought it build houses on it to live in till they haven't hardly any of 'em got big open yards any more and it's getting all too much built up
the way it used to be it was like a gentleman's country estate and that's the way my grandfather ought to keep it
he lets these people take too many liberties they do anything they want to  but how could he stop them lucy asked surely with reason
if he sold them the land it's theirs isn't it  george remained serene in the face of this apparently difficult question
he ought to have all the tradespeople boycott the families that sell part of their yards that way
all he'd have to do would be to tell the tradespeople they wouldn't get any more orders from the family if they didn't do it  from 'the family'
what family  our family said george unperturbed
the ambersons  i see she murmured and evidently she did see something that he did not for as she lifted her muff to her face he asked  what are you laughing at now  why  you always seem to have some little secret of your own to get happy over  always she exclaimed
what a big word when we only met last night  that's another case of it he said with obvious sincerity
one of the reasons i don't like youmuchis you've got that way of seeming quietly superior to everybody else  i she cried
i have  oh you think you keep it sort of confidential to yourself but it's plain enough
i don't believe in that kind of thing  you don't  no said george emphatically
not with me
i think the world's like this there's a few people that their birth and position and so on puts them at the top and they ought to treat each other entirely as equals his voice betrayed a little emotion as he added i wouldn't speak like this to everybody  you mean you're confiding your deepest creedor code whatever it isto me  go on make fun of it then george said bitterly
you do think you're terribly clever
it makes me tired  well as you don't like my seeming 'quietly superior' after this i'll be noisily superior she returned cheerfully
we aim to please  i had a notion before i came for you today that we were going to quarrel he said
no we won't it takes two she laughed and waved her muff toward a new house not quite completed standing in a field upon their right
they had passed beyond amberson addition and were leaving the northern fringes of the town for the open country
isn't that a beautiful house she exclaimed
papa and i call it our beautiful house  george was not pleased
does it belong to you  of course not
papa brought me out here the other day driving in his machine and we both loved it
it's so spacious and dignified and plain  yes it's plain enough george grunted
yet it's lovely the graygreen roof and shutters give just enough colour with the trees for the long white walls
it seems to me the finest house i've seen in this part of the country  george was outraged by an enthusiasm so ignorantnot ten minutes ago they had passed the amberson mansion
is that a sample of your taste in architecture he asked
yes
why  because it strikes me you better go somewhere and study the subject a little  lucy looked puzzled
what makes you have so much feeling about it
have i offended you  offended' nothing george returned brusquely
girls usually think they know it all as soon as they've learned to dance and dress and flirt a little
they never know anything about things like architecture for instance
that house is about as bum a house as any house i ever saw  why  why george repeated
did you ask me why  yes  well for one thing he pausedfor one thingwell just look at it
i shouldn't think you'd have to do any more than look at it if you'd ever given any attention to architecture  what is the matter with its architecture mr minafer  well it's this way said george
it's like this
well for instance that housewell it was built like a town house he spoke of it in the past tense because they had now left it far behind thema human habit of curious significance
it was like a house meant for a street in the city
what kind of a house was that for people of any taste to build out here in the country  but papa says it's built that way on purpose
there are a lot of other houses being built in this direction and papa says the city's coming out this way and in a year or two that house will be right in town  it was a bum house anyhow said george crossly
i don't even know the people that are building it
they say a lot of riffraff come to town every year nowadays and there's other riffraff that have always lived here and have made a little money and act as if they owned the place
uncle sydney was talking about it yesterday he says he and some of his friends are organizing a country club and already some of these riffraff are worming into itpeople he never heard of at all
anyhow i guess it's pretty clear you don't know a great deal about architecture  she demonstrated the completeness of her amiability by laughing
i'll know something about the north pole before long she said if we keep going much farther in this direction  at this he was remorseful
all right we'll turn and drive south awhile till you get warmed up again
i expect we have been going against the wind about long enough
indeed i'm sorry  he said indeed i'm sorry in a nice way and looked very strikingly handsome when he said it she thought
no doubt it is true that there is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner repented than over all the saints who consistently remain holy and the rare sudden gentlenesses of arrogant people have infinitely more effect than the continual gentleness of gentle people
arrogance turned gentle melts the heart and lucy gave her companion a little sidelong sunny nod of acknowledgment
george was dazzled by the quick glow of her eyes and found himself at a loss for something to say
having turned about he kept his horse to a walk and at this gait the sleighbells tinkled but intermittently
gleaming wanly through the whitish vapour that kept rising from the trotter's body and flanks they were like tiny fogbells and made the only sounds in a great winter silence
the white road ran between lonesome rail fences and frozen barnyards beyond the fences showed sometimes a harrow left to rust with its iron seat half filled with stiffened snow and sometimes an old dead buggy its wheels forever set it seemed in the solid ice of deep ruts
chickens scratched the metallic earth with an air of protest and a masterless ragged colt looked up in sudden horror at the mild tinkle of the passing bells then blew fierce clouds of steam at the sleigh
the snow no longer fell and far ahead in a grayish cloud that lay upon the land was the town
lucy looked at this distant thickening reflection
when we get this far out we can see there must be quite a little smoke hanging over the town she said
i suppose that's because it's growing
as it grows bigger it seems to get ashamed of itself so it makes this cloud and hides in it
papa says it used to be a bit nicer when he lived here he always speaks of it differentlyhe always has a gentle look a particular tone of voice i've noticed
he must have been very fond of it
it must have been a lovely place everybody must have been so jolly
from the way he talks you'd think life here then was just one long midsummer serenade
he declares it was always sunshine that the air wasn't like the air anywhere elsethat as he remembers it there always seemed to be golddust in the air
i doubt it
i think it doesn't seem to be duller air to him now just on account of having a little soot in it sometimes but probably because he was twenty years younger then
it seems to me the golddust he thinks was here is just his being young that he remembers
i think it was just youth
it is pretty pleasant to be young isn't it she laughed absently then appeared to become wistful
i wonder if we really do enjoy it as much as we'll look back and think we did
i don't suppose so
anyhow for my part i feel as if i must be missing something about it somehow because i don't ever seem to be thinking about what's happening at the present moment i'm always looking forward to somethingthinking about things that will happen when i'm older  you're a funny girl george said gently
but your voice sounds pretty nice when you think and talk along together like that  the horse shook himself all over and the impatient sleighbells made his wish audible
accordingly george tightened the reins and the cutter was off again at a threeminute trot no despicable rate of speed
it was not long before they were again passing lucy's beautiful house and here george thought fit to put an appendix to his remark
you're a funny girl and you know a lotbut i don't believe you know much about architecture  coming toward them black against the snowy road was a strange silhouette
it approached moderately and without visible means of progression so the matter seemed from a distance but as the cutter shortened the distance the silhouette was revealed to be mr morgan's horseless carriage conveying four people atop mr morgan with george's mother beside him and in the rear seat miss fanny minafer and the honorable george amberson
all four seemed to be in the liveliest humour like highspirited people upon a new adventure and isabel waved her handkerchief dashingly as the cutter flashed by them
for the lord's sake george gasped
your mother's a dear said lucy
and she does wear the most bewitching things
she looked like a russian princess though i doubt if they're that handsome  george said nothing he drove on till they had crossed amberson addition and reached the stone pillars at the head of national avenue
there he turned
let's go back and take another look at that old sewingmachine he said
it certainly is the weirdest craziest  he left the sentence unfinished and presently they were again in sight of the old sewingmachine
george shouted mockingly
alas
three figures stood in the road and a pair of legs with the toes turned up indicated that a fourth figure lay upon its back in the snow beneath a horseless carriage that had decided to need a horse
george became vociferous with laughter and coming up at his trotter's best gait snow spraying from runners and every hoof swerved to the side of the road and shot by shouting git a hoss
git a hoss
git a hoss  three hundred yards away he turned and came back racing leaning out as he passed to wave jeeringly at the group about the disabled machine git a hoss
git a hoss
git a  the trotter had broken into a gallop and lucy cried a warning be careful she said
look where you're driving
there's a ditch on that side
look  george turned too late the cutter's right runner went into the ditch and snapped off the little sleigh upset and after dragging its occupants some fifteen yards left them lying together in a bank of snow
then the vigorous young horse kicked himself free of all annoyances and disappeared down the road galloping cheerfully
chapter viii    when george regained some measure of his presence of mind miss lucy morgan's cheek snowy and cold was pressing his nose slightly to one side his right arm was firmly about her neck and a monstrous amount of her fur boa seemed to mingle with an equally unplausible quantity of snow in his mouth
he was confused but conscious of no objection to any of these juxtapositions
she was apparently uninjured for she sat up hatless her hair down and said mildly  good heavens  though her father had been under his machine when they passed he was the first to reach them
he threw himself on his knees beside his daughter but found her already laughing and was reassured
they're all right he called to isabel who was running toward them ahead of her brother and fanny minafer
this snowbank's a feather bednothing the matter with them at all
don't look so pale  georgie she gasped
georgie  georgie was on his feet snow all over him
don't make a fuss mother
nothing's the matter
that darned silly horse  sudden tears stood in isabel's eyes
to see you down underneathdraggingoh then with shaking hands she began to brush the snow from him
let me alone he protested
you'll ruin your gloves
you're getting snow all over you and  no no she cried
you'll catch cold you mustn't catch cold and she continued to brush him
amberson had brought lucy's hat miss fanny acted as lady'smaid and both victims of the accident were presently restored to about their usual appearance and condition of apparel
in fact encouraged by the two older gentlemen the entire party with one exception decided that the episode was after all a merry one and began to laugh about it
but george was glummer than the december twilight now swiftly closing in
that darned horse he said
i wouldn't bother about pendennis georgie said his uncle
you can send a man out for what's left of the cutter tomorrow and pendennis will gallop straight home to his stable he'll be there a long while before we will because all we've got to depend on to get us home is gene morgan's brokendown chafingdish yonder  they were approaching the machine as he spoke and his friend again underneath it heard him
he emerged smiling
she'll go he said
what  all aboard  he offered his hand to isabel
she was smiling but still pale and her eyes in spite of the smile kept upon george in a shocked anxiety
miss fanny had already mounted to the rear seat and george after helping lucy morgan to climb up beside his aunt was following
isabel saw that his shoes were light things of patent leather and that snow was clinging to them
she made a little rush toward him and as one of his feet rested on the iron step of the machine in mounting she began to clean the snow from his shoe with her almost aerial lace handkerchief
you mustn't catch cold she cried
stop that george shouted and furiously withdrew his foot
then stamp the snow off she begged
you mustn't ride with wet feet  they're not george roared thoroughly outraged
for heaven's sake get in
you're standing in the snow yourself
get in  isabel consented turning to morgan whose habitual expression of apprehensiveness was somewhat accentuated
he climbed up after her george amberson having gone to the other side
you're the same isabel i used to know he said in a low voice
you're a divinely ridiculous woman  am i eugene she said not displeased
'divinely' and 'ridiculous' just counterbalance each other don't they
plus one and minus one equal nothing so you mean i'm nothing in particular  no he answered tugging at a lever
that doesn't seem to be precisely what i meant
there this exclamation referred to the subterranean machinery for dismaying sounds came from beneath the floor and the vehicle plunged then rolled noisily forward
behold george amberson exclaimed
she does move
it must be another accident  accident morgan shouted over the din
no
she breathes she stirs she seems to feel a thrill of life along her keel and he began to sing the star spangled banner  amberson joined him lustily and sang on when morgan stopped
the twilight sky cleared discovering a round moon already risen and the musical congressman hailed this bright presence with the complete text and melody of the danube river  his nephew behind was gloomy
he had overheard his mother's conversation with the inventor it seemed curious to him that this morgan of whom he had never heard until last night should be using the name isabel so easily and george felt that it was not just the thing for his mother to call morgan eugene the resentment of the previous night came upon george again
meanwhile his mother and morgan continued their talk but he could no longer hear what they said the noise of the car and his uncle's songful mood prevented
he marked how animated isabel seemed it was not strange to see his mother so gay but it was strange that a man not of the family should be the cause of her gaiety
and george sat frowning
fanny minafer had begun to talk to lucy
your father wanted to prove that his horseless carriage would run even in the snow she said
it really does too  of course  it's so interesting
he's been telling us how he's going to change it
he says he's going to have wheels all made of rubber and blown up with air
i don't understand what he means at all i should think they'd explodebut eugene seems to be very confident
he always was confident though
it seems so like old times to hear him talk  she became thoughtful and lucy turned to george
you tried to swing underneath me and break the fall for me when we went over she said
i knew you were doing that andit was nice of you  wasn't any fall to speak of he returned brusquely
couldn't have hurt either of us  still it was friendly of youand awfully quick too
i'll noti'll not forget it  her voice had a sound of genuineness very pleasant and george began to forget his annoyance with her father
this annoyance of his had not been alleviated by the circumstance that neither of the seats of the old sewingmachine was designed for three people but when his neighbour spoke thus gratefully he no longer minded the crowdingin fact it pleased him so much that he began to wish the old sewingmachine would go even slower
and she had spoken no word of blame for his letting that darned horse get the cutter into the ditch
george presently addressed her hurriedly almost tremulously speaking close to her ear  i forgot to tell you something you're pretty nice
i thought so the first second i saw you last night
i'll come for you tonight and take you to the assembly at the amberson hotel
you're going aren't you  yes but i'm going with papa and the sharons i'll see you there  looks to me as if you were awfully conventional george grumbled and his disappointment was deeper than he was willing to let her seethough she probably did see
well we'll dance the cotillion together anyhow  i'm afraid not
i promised mr kinney  what george's tone was shocked as at incredible news
well you could break that engagement i guess if you wanted to
girls always can get out of things when they want to
won't you  i don't think so  why not  because i promised him
several days ago  george gulped and lowered his pride i don'toh look here
i only want to go to that thing tonight to get to see something of you and if you don't dance the cotillion with me how can i
i'll only be here two weeks and the others have got all the rest of your visit to see you
won't you do it please  i couldn't  see here said the stricken george
if you're going to decline to dance that cotillion with me simply because you've promised aaa miserable redheaded outsider like fred kinney why we might as well quit  quit what  you know perfectly well what i mean he said huskily
i don't  well you ought to  but i don't at all  george thoroughly hurt and not a little embittered expressed himself in a short outburst of laughter well i ought to have seen it  seen what  that you might turn out to be a girl who'd like a fellow of the redheaded kinney sort
i ought to have seen it from the first  lucy bore her disgrace lightly
oh dancing a cotillion with a person doesn't mean that you like himbut i don't see anything in particular the matter with mr kinney
what is  if you don't see anything the matter with him for yourself george responded icily i don't think pointing it out would help you
you probably wouldn't understand  you might try she suggested
of course i'm a stranger here and if people have done anything wrong or have something unpleasant about them i wouldn't have any way of knowing it just at first
if poor mr kinney  i prefer not to discuss it said george curtly
he's an enemy of mine  why  i prefer not to discuss it  well but  i prefer not to discuss it  very well she began to hum the air of the song which mr george amberson was now discoursing o moon of my delight that knows no waneand there was no further conversation on the back seat
they had entered amberson addition and the moon of mr amberson's delight was overlaid by a slender gothic filagree the branches that sprang from the shade trees lining the street
through the windows of many of the houses rosy lights were flickering and silver tinsel and evergreen wreaths and brilliant little glass globes of silver and wine colour could be seen and glimpses were caught of christmas trees with people decking them by firelightreminders that this was christmas eve
the ridestealers had disappeared from the highway though now and then over the gasping and howling of the horseless carriage there came a shrill jeer from some young passerby upon the sidewalk  mister fer heaven's sake go an' git a hoss
git a hoss
git a hoss  the contrivance stopped with a heartshaking jerk before isabel's house
the gentlemen jumped down helping isabel and fanny to descend there were friendly leavetakingsand one that was not precisely friendly
it's 'au revoir' till tonight isn't it lucy asked laughing
good afternoon said george and he did not wait as his relatives did to see the old sewing machine start briskly down the street toward the sharons' its lighter load consisting now of only mr morgan and his daughter
george went into the house at once
he found his father reading the evening paper in the library
where are your mother and your aunt fanny mr minafer inquired not looking up
they're coming said his son and casting himself heavily into a chair stared at the fire
his prediction was verified a few moments later the two ladies came in cheerfully unfastening their fur cloaks
it's all right georgie  said isabel
your uncle george called to us that pendennis got home safely
put your shoes close to the fire dear or else go and change them she went to her husband and patted him lightly on the shoulder an action which george watched with sombre moodiness
you might dress before long she suggested
we're all going to the assembly after dinner aren't we
brother george said he'd go with us  look here said george abruptly
how about this man morgan and his old sewingmachine
doesn't he want to get grandfather to put money into it
isn't he trying to work uncle george for that
isn't that what he's up to  it was miss fanny who responded
you little silly she cried with surprising sharpness
what on earth are you talking about
eugene morgan's perfectly able to finance his own inventions these days  i'll bet he borrows money of uncle george the nephew insisted
isabel looked at him in grave perplexity
why do you say such a thing george she asked
he strikes me as that sort of man he answered doggedly
isn't he father  minafer set down his paper for the moment
he was a fairly wild young fellow twenty years ago he said glancing at his wife absently
he was like you in one thing georgie he spent too much moneyonly he didn't have any mother to get money out of a grandfather for him so he was usually in debt
but i believe i've heard he's done fairly well of late years
no i can't say i think he's a swindler and i doubt if he needs anybody else's money to back his horseless carriage  well what's he brought the old thing here for then
people that own elephants don't take them elephants around with 'em when they go visiting
what's he got it here for  i'm sure i don't know said mr minafer resuming his paper
you might ask him  isabel laughed and patted her husband's shoulder again
aren't you going to dress
aren't we all going to the dance  he groaned faintly
aren't your brother and georgie escorts enough for you and fanny  wouldn't you enjoy it at all  you know i don't  isabel let her hand remain upon his shoulder a moment longer she stood behind him looking into the fire and george watching her broodingly thought there was more colour in her face than the reflection of the flames accounted for
well then she said indulgently stay at home and be happy
we won't urge you if you'd really rather not  i really wouldn't he said contentedly
half an hour later george was passing through the upper hall in a bathrobe stage of preparation for the evening's' gaieties when he encountered his aunt fanny
he stopped her
look here he said
what in the world is the matter with you she demanded regarding him with little amiability
you look as if you were rehearsing for a villain in a play
do change your expression  his expression gave no sign of yielding to the request on the contrary its somberness deepened
i suppose you don't know why father doesn't want to go tonight he said solemnly
you're his only sister and yet you don't know  he never wants to go anywhere that i ever heard of said fanny
what is the matter with you  he doesn't want to go because he doesn't like this man morgan  good gracious fanny cried impatiently
eugene morgan isn't in your father's thoughts at all one way or the other
why should he be  george hesitated
wellit strikes melook here what makes you andand everybodyso excited over him  excited she jeered
can't people be glad to see an old friend without silly children like you having to make a todo about it
i've just been in your mother's room suggesting that she might give a little dinner for them  for who  for whom georgie
for mr morgan and his daughter  look here george said quickly
don't do that
mother mustn't do that
it wouldn't look well  wouldn't look well fanny mocked him and her suppressed vehemence betrayed a surprising acerbity
see here georgie minafer i suggest that you just march straight on into your room and finish your dressing
sometimes you say things that show you have a pretty mean little mind  george was so astounded by this outburst that his indignation was delayed by his curiosity
why what upsets you this way he inquired
i know what you mean she said her voice still lowered but not decreasing in sharpness
you're trying to insinuate that i'd get your mother to invite eugene morgan here on my account because he's a widower  i am george gasped nonplussed
i'm trying to insinuate that you're setting your cap at him and getting mother to help you
is that what you mean  beyond a doubt that was what miss fanny meant
she gave him a whitehot look
you attend to your own affairs she whispered fiercely and swept away
george dumfounded returned to his room for meditation
he had lived for years in the same house with his aunt fanny and it now appeared that during all those years he had been thus intimately associating with a total stranger
never before had he met the passionate lady with whom he had just held a conversation in the hall
so she wanted to get married
and wanted george's mother to help her with this horselesscarriage widower
well i will be shot he muttered aloud
i willi certainly will be shot and he began' to laugh
lord 'lmighty  but presently at the thought of the horselesscarriage widower's daughter his grimness returned and he resolved upon a line of conduct for the evening
he would nod to her carelessly when he first saw her and after that he would notice her no more he would not dance with her he would not favour her in the cotillionhe would not go near her
he descended to dinner upon the third urgent summons of a coloured butler having spent two hours dressingand rehearsing
chapter ix   the honourable george amberson was a congressman who led cotillionsthe sort of congressman an amberson would be
he did it negligently tonight yet with infallible dexterity now and then glancing humorously at the spectators people of his own age
they were seated in a tropical grove at one end of the room whither they had retired at the beginning of the cotillion which they surrendered entirely to the twenties and the late 'teens
and here grouped with that stately pair sydney and amelia amberson sat isabel with fanny while eugene morgan appeared to bestow an amiable devotion impartially upon the three sistersinlaw
fanny watched his face eagerly laughing at everything he said amelia smiled blandly but rather because of graciousness than because of interest while isabel looking out at the dancers rhythmically moved a great fan of blue ostrich feathers listened to eugene thoughtfully yet all the while kept her shining eyes on georgie
georgie had carried out his rehearsed projects with precision he had given miss morgan a nod studied into perfection during his lengthy toilet before dinner
oh yes i do seem to remember that curious little outsider this nod seemed to say
thereafter all cognizance of her evaporated the curious little outsider was permitted no further existence worth the struggle
nevertheless she flashed in the corner of his eye too often
he was aware of her dancing demurely and of her viciously flirtatious habit of never looking up at her partner but keeping her eyes concealed beneath downcast lashes and he had oversufficient consciousness of her between the dances though it was not possible to see her at these times even if he had cared to look frankly in her directionshe was invisible in a thicket of young dresscoats
the black thicket moved as she moved and her location was hatefully apparent even if he had not heard her voice laughing from the thicket
it was annoying how her voice though never loud pursued him
no matter how vociferous were other voices all about he seemed unable to prevent himself from constantly recognizing hers
it had a quaver in it not patheticrather humorous than pathetica quality which annoyed him to the point of rage because it was so difficult to get away from
she seemed to be having a wonderful time  an unbearable soreness accumulated in his chest his dislike of the girl and her conduct increased until he thought of leaving this sickening assembly and going home to bed
that would show her
but just then he heard her laughing and decided that it wouldn't show her
so he remained
when the young couples seated themselves in chairs against the walls round three sides of the room for the cotillion george joined a brazenfaced group clustering about the doorwayyouths with no partners yet eligible to be called out and favoured
he marked that his uncle placed the infernal kinney and miss morgan as the leading couple in the first chairs at the head of the line upon the leader's right and this disloyalty on the part of uncle george was inexcusable for in the family circle the nephew had often expressed his opinion of fred kinney
in his bitterness george uttered a significant monosyllable
the music flourished whereupon mr kinney miss morgan and six of their neighbours rose and waltzed knowingly
mr amberson's whistle blew' then the eight young people went to the favourtable and were given toys and trinkets wherewith to delight the new partners it was now their privilege to select
around the walls the seated nonparticipants in this ceremony looked rather conscious some chattered endeavouring not to appear expectant some tried not to look wistful and others were frankly solemn
it was a trying moment and whoever secured a favour this very first shot might consider the portents happy for a successful evening
holding their twinkling gewgaws in their hands those about to bestow honour came toward the seated lines where expressions became feverish
two of the approaching girls seemed to wander not finding a predetermined object in sight and these two were janie sharon and her cousin lucy
at this george amberson minafer conceiving that he had little to anticipate from either turned a proud back upon the room and affected to converse with his friend mr charlie johnson
the next moment a quick little figure intervened between the two
it was lucy gaily offering a silver sleighbell decked with white ribbon
i almost couldn't find you she cried
george stared took her hand led her forth in silence danced with her
she seemed content not to talk but as the whistle blew signalling that this episode was concluded and he conducted her to her seat she lifted the little bell toward him
you haven't taken your favour
you're supposed to pin it on your coat she said
don't you want it  if you insist said george stiffly
and he bowed her into her chair then turned and walked away dropping the sleighbell haughtily into his trousers' pocket
the figure proceeded to its conclusion and george was given other sleighbells which he easily consented to wear upon his lapel but as the next figure 'began he strolled with a bored air to the tropical grove where sat his elders and seated himself beside his uncle sydney
his mother leaned across miss fanny raising her voice over the music to speak to him
georgie nobody will be able to see you here
you'll not be favoured
you ought to be where you can dance  don't care to he returned
bore  but you ought she stopped and laughed waving her fan to direct his attention behind him
look
over your shoulder  he turned and discovered miss lucy morgan in the act of offering him a purple toy balloon
i found you she laughed
george was startled
well he said
would you rather 'sit it out
' lucy asked quickly as he did not move
i don't care to dance if you  no he said rising
it would be better to dance his tone was solemn and solemnly he departed with her from the grove
solemnly he danced with her
four times with not the slightest encouragement she brought him a favour 'four times in succession
when the fourth came look here  said george huskily
you going to keep this up all night
what do you mean by it  for an instant she seemed confused
that's what cotillions are for aren't they she murmured
what do you mean what they're for  so that a girl can dance with a person she wants to  george's huskiness increased
well do you mean youyou want to dance with me all the timeall evening  well this much of itevidently she laughed
is it because you thought i tried to keep you from getting hurt this afternoon when we upset  she shook her head
was it because you want to even things up for making me angryi mean for hurting my feelings on the way home  with her eyes avertedfor girls of nineteen can be as shy as boys sometimesshe said wellyou only got angry because i couldn't dance the cotillion with you
ii didn't feel terribly hurt with you for getting angry about that  was there any other reason
did my telling you i liked you have anything to do with it  she looked up gently and as george met her eyes something exquisitely touching yet queerly delightful gave him a catch in the throat
she looked instantly away and turning ran out from the palm grove where they stood to the dancingfloor
come on she cried
let's dance  he followed her
see hereii he stammered
you meando you  no no she laughed
let's dance  he put his arm about her almost tremulously and they began to waltz
it was a happy dance for both of them
christmas day is the children's but the holidays are youth's dancingtime
the holidays belong to the early twenties and the 'teens home from school and college
these years possess the holidays for a little while then possess them only in smiling wistful memories of holly and twinkling lights and dancemusic and charming faces all aglow
it is the liveliest time in life the happiest of the irresponsible times in life
mothers echo its happinessnothing is like a mother who has a son home from college except another mother with a son home from college
bloom does actually come upon these mothers it is a visible thing and they run like girls walk like athletes laugh like sycophants
yet they give up their sons to the daughters of other mothers and find it proud rapture enough to be allowed to sit and watch
thus isabel watched george and lucy dancing as together they danced away the holidays of that year into the past
they seem to get along better than they did at first those two children fanny minafer said sitting beside her at the sharons' dance a week after the assembly
they seemed to be always having little quarrels of some sort at first
at least george did he seemed to be continually pecking at that lovely dainty little lucy and being cross with her over nothing  pecking isabel laughed
what a word to use about georgie
i think i never knew a more angelically amiable disposition in my life  miss fanny echoed her sisterinlaw's laugh but it was a rueful echo and not sweet
he's amiable to you she said
that's all the side of him you ever happen to see
and why wouldn't he be amiable to anybody that simply fell down and worshipped him every minute of her life
most of us would  isn't he worth worshipping
just look at him
isn't he charming with lucy
see how hard he ran to get it when she dropped her handkerchief back there  oh i'm not going to argue with you about george said miss fanny
i'm fond enough of him for that matter
he can be charming and he's certainly stunning looking if only  let the 'if only' go dear isabel suggested goodnaturedly
let's talk about that dinner you thought i should  i miss fanny interrupted quickly
didn't you want to give it yourself  indeed i did my dear said isabel heartily
i only meant that unless you had proposed it perhaps i wouldn't  but here eugene came for her to dance and she left the sentence uncompleted
holiday dances can be happy for youth renewed as well as for youth in budand yet it was not with the air of a rival that miss fanny watched her brother's wife dancing with the widower
miss fanny's eyes narrowed a little but only as if her mind engaged in a hopeful calculation
she looked pleased
chapter x    a few days after george's return to the university it became evident that not quite everybody had gazed with complete benevolence upon the various young collegians at their holiday sports
the sunday edition of the principal morning paper even expressed some bitterness under the heading gilded youths of the findesieclethis was considered the knowing phrase of the time especially for sunday supplementsand there is no doubt that from certain references in this bit of writing some people drew the conclusion that mr george amberson minafer had not yet got his comeuppance a postponement still irritating
undeniably fanny minafer was one of the people who drew this conclusion for she cut the article out and enclosed it in a letter to her nephew having written on the border of the clipping i wonder whom it can mean  george read part of it
we debate sometimes what is to be the future of this nation when we think that in a few years public affairs may be in the hands of the findesiecle gilded youths we see about us during the christmas holidays
such foppery such luxury such insolence was surely never practised by the scented overbearing patricians of the palatine even in rome's most decadent epoch
in all the wild orgy of wastefulness and luxury with which the nineteenth century reaches its close the gilded youth has been surely the worst symptom
with his airs of young milord his fast horses his gold and silver cigarettecases his clothes from a new york tailor his recklessness of money showered upon him by indulgent mothers or doting grandfathers he respects nothing and nobody
he is blase if you please
watch him at a social function how condescendingly he deigns to select a partner for the popular waltz or two step how carelessly he shoulders older people out of his way with what a blank stare he returns the salutation of some old acquaintance whom he may choose in his royal whim to forget
the unpleasant part of all this is that the young women he so condescendingly selects as partners for the dance greet him with seeming rapture though in their hearts they must feel humiliated by his languid hauteur and many older people beam upon him almost fawningly if he unbends so far as to throw them a careless disdainful word
one wonders what has come over the new generation
of such as these the republic was not made
let us pray that the future of our country is not in the hands of these findesiecle gilded youths but rather in the calloused palms of young men yet unknown labouring upon the farms of the land
when we compare the young manhood of abraham lincoln with the specimens we are now producing we see too well that it bodes ill for the twentieth century  george yawned and tossed the clipping into his wastebasket wondering why his aunt thought such dull nonsense worth the sending
as for her insinuation pencilled upon the border he supposed she meant to jokea supposition which neither surprised him nor altered his lifelong opinion of her wit
he read her letter with more interest  the dinner your mother gave for the morgans was a lovely affair
it was last monday evening just ten days after you left
it was peculiarly appropriate that your mother should give this dinner because her brother george your uncle was mr morgan's most intimate friend before he left here a number of years ago and it was a pleasant occasion for the formal announcement of some news which you heard from lucy morgan before you returned to college
at least she told me she had told you the night before you left that her father had decided to return here to live
it was appropriate that your mother herself an old friend should assemble a representative selection of mr morgan's old friends around him at such a time
he was in great spirits and most entertaining
as your time was so charmingly taken up during your visit home with a younger member of his family you probably overlooked opportunities of hearing him talk and do not know what an interesting man he can be
he will soon begin to build his factory here for the manufacture of automobiles which he says is a term he prefers to horseless carriages your uncle george told me he would like to invest in this factory as george thinks there is a future for automobiles perhaps not for general use but as an interesting novelty which people with sufficient means would like to own for their amusement and the sake of variety
however he said mr morgan laughingly declined his offer as mr m was fully able to finance this venture though not starting in a very large way
your uncle said other people are manufacturing automobiles in different parts of the country with success
your father is not very well though he is not actually ill and the doctor tells him he ought not to be so much at his office as the long years of application indoors with no exercise are beginning to affect him unfavourably but i believe your father would die if he had to give up his work which is all that has ever interested him outside of his family
i never could understand it
mr morgan took your mother and me with lucy to see modjeska in twelfth night yesterday evening and lucy said she thought the duke looked rather like you only much more democratic in his manner
i suppose you will think i have written a great deal about the morgans in this letter but thought you would be interested because of your interest in a younger member of his family
hoping that you are finding college still as attractive as ever               affectionately                         aunt fanny
george read one sentence in this letter several times
then he dropped the missive in his wastebasket to join the clipping and strolled down the corridor of his dormitory to borrow a copy of twelfth night  having secured one he returned to his study and refreshed his memory of the playbut received no enlightenment that enabled him to comprehend lucy's strange remark
however he found himself impelled in the direction of correspondence and presently wrote a letternot a reply to his aunt fanny
dear lucy no doubt you will be surprised at hearing from me so soon again especially as this makes two in answer to the one received from you since getting back to the old place
i hear you have been making comments about me at the theatre that some actor was more democratic in his manners than i am which i do not understand
you know my theory of life because i explained it to you on our first drive together when i told you i would not talk to everybody about things i feel like the way i spoke to you of my theory of life
i believe those who are able should have a true theory of life and i developed my theory of life long long ago
well here i sit smoking my faithful briar pipe indulging in the fragrance of my tobacco as i look out on the campus from my manypaned window and things are different with me from the way they were way back in freshman year
i can see now how boyish in many ways i was then
i believe what has changed me as much as anything was my visit home at the time i met you
so i sit here with my faithful briar and dream the old dreams over as it were dreaming of the waltzes we waltzed together and of that last night before we parted and you told me the good news you were going to live there and i would find my friend waiting for me when i get home next summer
i will be glad my friend will be waiting for me
i am not capable of friendship except for the very few and looking back over my life i remember there were times when i doubted if i could feel a great friendship for anybodyespecially girls
i do not take a great interest in many people as you know for i find most of them shallow
here in the old place i do not believe in being hailfellowwellmet with every tom dick and harry just because he happens to be a classmate any more than i do at home where i have always been careful who i was seen with largely on account of the family but also because my disposition ever since my boyhood has been to encourage real intimacy from but the few
what are you reading now
i have finished both henry esmond and the virginians i like thackeray because he is not trashy and because he writes principally of nice people
my theory of literature is an author who does not indulge in trashinesswrites about people you could introduce into your own home
i agree with my uncle sydney as i once heard him say he did not care to read a book or go to a play about people he would not care to meet at his own dinner table
i believe we should live by certain standards and ideals as you know from my telling you my theory of life
well a letter is no place for deep discussions so i will not go into the subject
from several letters from my mother and one from aunt fanny i hear you are seeing a good deal of the family since i left
i hope sometimes you think of the member who is absent
i got a silver frame for your photograph in new york and i keep it on my desk
it is the only girl's photograph i ever took the trouble to have framed though as i told you frankly i have had any number of other girls' photographs yet all were only passing fancies and oftentimes i have questioned in years past if i was capable of much friendship toward the feminine sex which i usually found shallow until our own friendship began
when i look at your photograph i say to myself at last at last here is one that will not prove shallow  my faithful briar has gone out
i will have to rise and fill it then once more in the fragrance of my lady nicotine i will sit and dream the old dreams over and think too of the true friend at home awaiting my return in june for the summer vacation
friend this is from your friend                                             gam
george's anticipations were not disappointed
when he came home in june his friend was awaiting him at least she was so pleased to see him again that for a few minutes after their first encounter she was a little breathless and a great deal glowing and quiet withal
their sentimental friendship continued though sometimes he was irritated by her making it less sentimental than he did and sometimes by what he called her air of superiority her air was usually in truth that of a fond but amused older sister and george did not believe such an attitude was warranted by her eight months of seniority
lucy and her father were living at the amberson hotel while morgan got his small machineshops built in a western outskirt of the town and george grumbled about the shabbiness and the oldfashioned look of the hotel though it was still the best in the place of course he remonstrated with his grandfather declaring that the whole amberson estate would be getting rundown and outatheel if things weren't taken in hand pretty soon he urged the general need of rebuilding renovating varnishing and lawsuits
but the major declining to hear him out interrupted querulously saying that he had enough to bother him without any advice from george and retired to his library going so far as to lock the door audibly
second childhood george muttered shaking his head and he thought sadly that the major had not long to live
however this surmise depressed him for only a moment or so
of course people couldn't be expected to live forever and it would be a good thing to have someone in charge of the estate who wouldn't let it get to looking so rusty that riffraff dared to make fun of it
for george had lately undergone the annoyance of calling upon the morgans in the rather stuffy red velours and gilt parlour of their apartment at the hotel one evening when mr frederick kinney also was a caller and mr kinney had not been tactful
in fact though he adopted a humorous tone of voice in expressing his sympathy for people who through the city's poverty in hotels were obliged to stay at the amberson mr kinney's intention was interpreted by the other visitor as not at all humorous but on the contrary personal and offensive
george rose abruptly his face the colour of wrath
goodnight miss morgan
goodnight mr morgan he said
i shall take pleasure in calling at some other time when a more courteous sort of people may be present  look here the hotheaded fred burst out
don't you try to make me out a boor george minafer
i wasn't hinting anything at you i simply forgot all about your grandfather owning this old building
don't you try to put me in the light of a boor
i won't  but george walked out in the very course of this vehement protest and it was necessarily left unfinished
mr kinney remained only a few moments after george's departure and as the door closed upon him the distressed lucy turned to her father
she was plaintively surprised to find him in a condition of immoderate laughter
i didn'ti didn't think i could hold out he gasped and after choking until tears came to his eyes felt blindly for the chair from which he had risen to wish mr kinney an indistinct goodnight
his hand found the arm of the chair he collapsed feebly and sat uttering incoherent sounds
papa  it brings things back so he managed to explain this very fred kinney's father and young george's father wilbur minafer used to do just such things when they were at that ageand for that matter so did george amberson and i and all the rest of us and in spite of his exhaustion he began to imitate don't you try to put me in the light of a boor i shall take pleasure in calling at some time when a more courteous sort of people he was unable to go on
there is a mirth for every age and lucy failed to comprehend her father's but tolerated it a little ruefully
papa i think they were shocking
weren't they awful  justjust boys he moaned wiping his eyes
but lucy could not smile at all she was beginning to look indignant
i can forgive that poor fred kinney she said
he's just blunderingbut georgeoh george behaved outrageously  it's a difficult age her father observed his calmness somewhat restored
girls don't seem to have to pass through it quite as boys do or their savoir faire is instinctiveor something and he gave away to a return of his convulsion
she came and sat upon the arm of his chair
papa why should george behave like that  he's sensitive  rather
but why is he
he does anything he likes to without any regard for what people think
then why should he mind so furiously when the least little thing reflects upon him or on anything or anybody connected with him  eugene patted her hand
that's one of the greatest puzzles of human vanity dear and i don't pretend to know the answer
in all my life the most arrogant people that i've known have been the most sensitive
the people who have done the most in contempt of other people's opinion and who consider themselves the highest above it have been the most furious if it went against them
arrogant and domineering people can't stand the least lightest faintest breath of criticism
it just kills them  papa do you think george is arrogant and domineering  oh he's still only a boy said eugene consolingly
there's plenty of fine stuff in himcan't help but be because he's isabel amberson's son  lucy stroked his hair which was still almost as dark as her own
you liked her pretty well once i guess papa  i do still he said quietly
she's lovelylovely
papa she paused then continuedi wonder sometimes  what  i wonder just how she happened to marry mr minafer  oh minafer's all right said eugene
he's a quiet sort of man but he's a good man and a kind man
he always was and those things count  but in a waywell i've heard people say there wasn't anything to him at all except business and saving money
miss fanny minafer herself told me that everything george and his mother have of their ownthat is just to spend as they likeshe says it has always come from major amberson  thrift horatio said eugene lightly
thrift's an inheritance and a common enough one here
the people who settled the country had to save so making and saving were taught as virtues and the people to the third generation haven't found out that making and saving are only means to an end
minafer doesn't believe in money being spent
he believes god made it to be invested and saved  but george isn't saving
he's reckless and even if he is arrogant and conceited and badtempered he's awfully generous  oh he's an amberson said her father
the ambersons aren't saving
they're too much the other way most of them  i don't think i should have called george badtempered lucy said thoughtfully
no
i don't think he is  only when he's cross about something morgan suggested with a semblance of sympathetic gravity
yes she said brightly not perceiving that his intention was humorous
all the rest of the time he's really very amiable
of course he's much more a perfect child the whole time than he realizes
he certainly behaved awfully tonight she jumped up her indignation returning
he did indeed and it won't do to encourage him in it
i think he'll find me pretty coolfor a week or so  whereupon her father suffered a renewal of his attack of uproarious laughter
chapter xi    in the matter of coolness george met lucy upon her own predetermined ground in fact he was there first and at their next encounter proved loftier and more formal than she did
their estrangement lasted three weeks and then disappeared without any preliminary treaty it had worn itself out and they forgot it
at times however george found other disturbances to the friendship
lucy was too much the village belle he complained and took a satiric attitude toward his competitors referring to them as her local swains and bumpkins sulking for an afternoon when she reminded him that he too was at least local she was a belle with older people as well isabel and fanny were continually taking her driving bringing her home with them to lunch or dinner and making a hundred little engagements with her and the major had taken a great fancy to her insisting upon her presence and her father's at the amberson family dinner at the mansion every sunday evening
she knew how to flirt with old people he said as she sat next him at the table on one of these sunday occasions and he had always liked her father even when eugene was a terror long ago
oh yes he was the major laughed when she remonstrated
he came up here with my son george and some others for a serenade one night and eugene stepped into a bass fiddle and the poor musicians just gave up
i had a pretty halfhour getting my son george upstairs
i remember
it was the last time eugene ever touched a dropbut he'd touched plenty before that young lady and he daren't deny it
well well there's another thing that's changed hardly anybody drinks nowadays
perhaps it's just as well but things used to be livelier
that serenade was just before isabel was marriedand don't you fret miss lucy your father remembers it well enough the old gentleman burst into laughter and shook his finger at eugene across the table
the fact is the major went on hilariously i believe if eugene hadn't broken that bass fiddle and given himself away isabel would never have taken wilbur
i shouldn't be surprised if that was about all the reason that wilbur got her
what do you think
wilbur  i shouldn't be surprised said wilbur placidly
if your notion is right i'm glad 'gene broke the fiddle
he was giving me a hard run  the major always drank three glasses of champagne at his sunday dinner and he was finishing the third
what do you say about it isabel
by jove he cried pounding the table
she's blushing  isabel did blush but she laughed
who wouldn't blush she cried and her sisterinlaw came to her assistance
the important thing said fanny jovially is that wilbur did get her and not only got her but kept her  eugene was as pink as isabel but he laughed without any sign of embarrassment other than his heightened colour
there's another important thingthat is for me he said
it's the only thing that makes me forgive that bass viol for getting in my way  what is it the major asked
lucy said morgan gently
isabel gave him a quick glance all warm approval and there was a murmur of friendliness round the table
george was not one of those who joined in this applause
he considered his grandfather's nonsense indelicate even for second childhood and he thought that the sooner the subject was dropped the better
however he had only a slight recurrence of the resentment which had assailed him during the winter at every sign of his mother's interest in morgan though he was still ashamed of his aunt sometimes when it seemed to him that fanny was almost publicly throwing herself at the widower's head
fanny and he had one or two arguments in which her fierceness again astonished and amused him
you drop your criticisms of your relatives she bade him hotly one day and begin thinking a little about your own behaviour
you say people will 'talk' about myabout my merely being pleasant to an old friend
what do i care how they talk
i guess if people are talking about anybody in this family they're talking about the impertinent little snippet that hasn't any respect for anything and doesn't even know enough to attend to his own affairs  snippet' aunt fanny george laughed
how elegant
and 'little snippet'when i'm over fivefeeteleven  i said it she snapped departing
i don't see how lucy can stand you  you'd make an amiable stepmotherinlaw he called after her
i'll be careful about proposing to lucy  these were but roughish spots in a summer that glided by evenly and quickly enough for the most part and at the end seemed to fly
on the last night before george went back to be a junior his mother asked him confidently if it had not been a happy summer
he hadn't thought about it he answered
oh' i suppose so
why  i just thought it would be nice to hear you say so she said smiling
i mean it's pleasant for people of my age to know that people of your age realize that they're happy  people of your age he repeated
you know you don't look precisely like an old woman mother
not precisely  no she said
and i suppose i feel about as young as you do inside but it won't be many years before i must begin to look old
it does come she sighed still smiling
it's seemed to me that it must have been a happy summer for youa real 'summer of roses and wine'without the wine perhaps
'gather ye roses while ye may'or was it primroses
time does really fly or perhaps it's more like the skyand smoke  george was puzzled
what do you mean time being like the sky and smoke  i mean the things that we have and that we think are so solidthey're like smoke and time is like the sky that the smoke disappears into
you know how wreath of smoke goes up from a chimney and seems all thick and black and busy against the sky as if it were going to do such important things and last forever and you see it getting thinner and thinnerand then in such a little while it isn't there at all nothing is left but the sky and the sky keeps on being just the same forever  it strikes me you're getting mixed up said george cheerfully
i don't see much resemblance between time and the sky or between things and smokewreaths but i do see one reason you like 'lucy morgan so much
she talks that same kind of wistful moony way sometimesi don't mean to say i mind it in either of you because i rather like to listen to it and you've got a very good voice mother
it's nice to listen to no matter how much smoke and sky and so on you talk
so's lucy's for that matter and i see why you're congenial
she talks that way to her father too and he's right there with the same kind of guff
well it's all right with me he laughed teasingly and allowed her to retain his hand which she had fondly seized
i've got plenty to think about when people drool along  she pressed his hand to her cheek and a tear made a tiny warm streak across one of his knuckles
for heaven's sake he said
what's the matter
isn't everything all right  you're going away  well i'm coming back don't you suppose
is that all that worries you  she cheered up and smiled again but shook her head
i never can bear to see you gothat's the most of it
i'm a little bothered about your father too  why  it seems to me he looks so badly
everybody thinks so  what nonsense george laughed
he's been looking that way all summer
he isn't much different from the way he's looked all his life that i can see
what's the matter with him  he never talks much about his business to me but i think he's been worrying about some investments he made last year
i think his worry has affected his health  what investments george demanded
he hasn't gone into mr morgan's automobile concern has he  no isabel smiled
the 'automobile concern' is all eugene's and it's so small i understand it's taken hardly anything
no your father has always prided himself on making only the most absolutely safe investments but two or three years ago he and your uncle george both put a great dealpretty much everything they could get together i thinkinto the stock of rollingmills some friends of theirs owned and i'm afraid the mills haven't been doing well  what of that
father needn't worry
you and i could take care of him the rest of his life on what grandfather  of course she agreed
but your father's always lived so for his business and taken such pride in his sound investments it's a passion with him
i  pshaw
he needn't worry
you tell him we'll look after him we'll build him a little stone bank in the backyard if he busts up and he can go and put his pennies in it every morning
that'll keep him just as happy as he ever was he kissed her
goodnight i'm going to tell lucy goodbye
don't sit up for me  she walked to the front gate with him still holding his hand and he told her again not to sit up for him
yes i will she laughed
you won't be very late  wellit's my last night  but i know lucy and she knows i want to see you too your last night
you'll see she'll send you home promptly at eleven  but she was mistaken lucy sent him home promptly at ten
chapter xii    isabels uneasiness about her husbands healthsometimes reflected in her letters to george during the winter that followedhad not been alleviated when the accredited senior returned for his next summer vacation and she confided to him in his room soon after his arrival that something the doctor had said to her lately had made her more uneasy than ever
still worrying over his rollingmills investments george asked not seriously impressed
i'm afraid it's past that stage from what dr rainey says
his worries only aggravate his condition now
dr rainey says we ought to get him away  well let's do it then  he won't go  he's a man awfully set in his ways that's true said george
i don't think there's anything much the matter with him though and he looks just the same to me
have you seen lucy lately
how is she  hasn't she written you  oh about once a month he answered carelessly
never says much about herself
how's she look  she lookspretty said isabel
i suppose she wrote you they've moved  yes i've got her address
she said they were building  they did
it's all finished and they've been in it a month
lucy is so capable she keeps house exquisitely
it's small but oh such a pretty little house  well that's fortunate george said
one thing i've always felt they didn't know a great deal about is architecture  don't they asked isabel surprised
anyhow their house is charming
it's way out beyond the end of amberson boulevard it's quite near that big white house with a graygreen roof somebody built out there a year or so ago
there are any number of houses going up out that way and the trolleyline runs within a block of them now on the next street and the traction people are laying tracks more than three miles beyond
i suppose you'll be driving out to see lucy tomorrow  i thought george hesitated
i thought perhaps i'd go after dinner this evening  at this his mother laughed not astonished
it was only my feeble joke about 'tomorrow' georgie
i was pretty sure you couldn't wait that long
did lucy write you about the factory  no
what factory  the automobile shops
they had rather a dubious time at first i'm afraid and some of eugene's experiments turned out badly but this spring they've finished eight automobiles and sold them all and they've got twelve more almost finished and they're sold already
eugene's so gay over it  what do his old sewingmachines look like
like that first one he had when they came here  no indeed
these have rubber tires blown up with airpneumatic
and they aren't so high they're very easy to get into and the engine's in fronteugene thinks that's a great improvement
they're very interesting to look at behind the driver's seat there's a sort of box where four people can sit with a step and a little door in the rear and  i know all about it said george
i've seen any number like that east
you can see all you want of 'em if you stand on fifth avenue half an hour any afternoon
i've seen halfadozen go by almost at the same timewithin a few minutes anyhow and of course electric hansoms are a common sight there any day
i hired one myself the last time i was there
how fast do mr morgan's machines go  much too fast
it's very exhilaratingbut rather frightening and they do make a fearful uproar
he says though he thinks he sees a way to get around the noisiness in time  i don't mind the noise said george
give me a horse for mine though any day
i must get up a race with one of these things pendennis'll leave it one mile behind in a twomile run
how's grandfather  he looks well but he complains sometimes of his heart i suppose that's natural at his ageand it's an amberson trouble having mentioned this she looked anxious instantly
did you ever feel any weakness there georgie  no he laughed
are you sure dear  no and he laughed again
did you  oh i think notat least the doctor told me he thought my heart was about all right
he said i needn't be alarmed  i should think not
women do seem to be always talking about health i suppose they haven't got enough else to think of  that must be it she said gayly
we're an idle lot  george had taken off his coat
i don't like to hint to a lady he said but i do want to dress before dinner  don't be long i've got to do a lot of looking at you dear she kissed him and ran away singing
but his aunt fanny was not so fond and at the dinnertable there came a spark of liveliness into her eye when george patronizingly asked her what was the news in her own particular line of sport  what do you mean georgie she asked quietly
oh i mean what's the news in the fast set generally
you been causing any divorces lately  no said fanny the spark in her eye getting brighter
i haven't been causing anything  well what's the gossip
you usually hear pretty much everything that goes on around the nooks and crannies in this town i hear
what's the last from the gossips' corner auntie  fanny dropped her eyes and the spark was concealed but a movement of her lower lip betokened a tendency to laugh as she replied
there hasn't been much gossip lately except the report that lucy morgan and fred kinney are engagedand that's quite old by this time  undeniably this bit of mischief was entirely successful for there was a clatter upon george's plate
whatwhat do you think you're talking about he gasped
miss fanny looked up innocently
about the report of lucy morgan's engagement to fred kinney  george turned dumbly to his mother and isabel shook her head reassuringly
people are always starting rumours she said
i haven't paid any attention to this one  but youyou've heard it he stammered
oh one hears all sorts of nonsense dear
i haven't the slightest idea that it's true  then you have heard it  i wouldn't let it take my appetite his father suggested drily
there are plenty of girls in the world  george turned pale
eat your dinner georgie his aunt said sweetly
food will do you good
i didn't say i knew this rumour was true
i only said i'd heard it  when
when did you hear it  oh months ago and fanny found any further postponement of laughter impossible
fanny you're a hardhearted creature isabel said gently
you really are
don't pay any attention to her george
fred kinney's only a clerk in his uncle's hardware place he couldn't marry for ageseven if anybody would accept him  george breathed tumultuously
i don't care anything about 'ages'
what's that got to do with it he said his thoughts appearing to be somewhat disconnected
ages' don't mean anything
i only want to knowi want to knowi want he stopped
what do you want his father asked crossly
why don't you say it
don't make such a fuss  i'm notnot at all george declared pushing his chair back from the table
you must finish your dinner dear his mother urged
don't  i have finished
i've eaten all i want
i don't want any more than i wanted
i don't wanti he rose still incoherent
i preferi wantplease excuse me  he left the room and a moment later the screens outside the open front door were heard to slam  fanny
you shouldn't  isabel don't reproach me he did have plenty of dinner and i only told the truth everybody has been saying  but there isn't any truth in it  we don't actually know there isn't miss fanny insisted giggling
we've never asked lucy  i wouldn't ask her anything so absurd  george would george's father remarked
that's what he's gone to do  mr minafer was not mistaken that was what his son had gone to do
lucy and her father were just rising from their dinner table when the stirred youth arrived at the front door of the new house
it was a cottage however rather than a house and lucy had taken a free hand with the architect achieving results in white and green outside and white and blue inside to such effect of youth and daintiness that her father complained of too much springtime the whole place including his own bedroom was a young damsel's boudoir he said so that nowhere could he smoke a cigar without feeling like a ruffian
however he was smoking when george arrived and he encouraged george to join him in the pastime but the caller whose air was both tense and preoccupied declined with something like agitation
i never smokethat is i'm seldomi mean no thanks he said
i mean not at all
i'd rather not  aren't you well george eugene asked looking at him in perplexity
have you been overworking at college
you do look rather pa  i don't work said george
i mean i don't work
i think but i don't work
i only work at the end of the term
there isn't much to do  eugene's perplexity was little decreased and a tinkle of the doorbell afforded him obvious relief
it's my foreman he said looking at his watch
i'll take him out in the yard to talk
this is no place for a foreman and he departed leaving the living room to lucy and george
it was a pretty room white panelled and blue curtainedand no place for a foreman as eugene said
there was a grand piano and lucy stood leaning back against it looking intently at george while her fingers behind her absently struck a chord or two
and her dress was the dress for that room being of blue and white too and the high colour in her cheeks was far from interfering with the general harmony of thingsgeorge saw with dismay that she was prettier than ever and naturally he missed the reassurance he might have felt had he been able to guess that lucy on her part was finding him better looking than ever
for however unusual the scope of george's pride vanity of beauty was not included he did not think about his looks
what's wrong george she asked softly
what do you mean 'what's wrong  you're awfully upset about something
didn't you get though your examination all right  certainly i did
what makes you think anything's 'wrong' with me  you do look pale as papa said and it seemed to me that the way you talked soundedwell a little confused  confused'
i said i didn't care to smoke
what in the world is confused about that  nothing
but  see here george stepped close to her
are you glad to see me  you needn't be so fierce about it lucy protested laughing at his dramatic intensity
of course i am
how long have i been looking forward to it  i don't know he said sharply abating nothing of his fierceness
how long have you  whyever since you went away  is that true
lucy is that true  you are funny she said
of course it's true
do tell me what's the matter with you george  i will he exclaimed
i was a boy when i saw you last
i see that now though i didn't then
well i'm not a boy any longer
i'm a man and a man has a right to demand a totally different treatment  why has he  what  i don't seem to be able to understand you at all george
why shouldn't a boy be treated just as well as a man  george seemed to find himself at a loss
why shouldn'twell he shouldn't because a man has a right to certain explanations  what explanations  whether he's been made a toy of george almost shouted
that's what i want to know  lucy shook her head despairingly
you are the queerest person
you say you're a man now but you talk more like a boy than ever
what does make you so excited  'excited
' he stormed
do you dare to stand there and call me 'excited'
i tell you i never have been more calm or calmer in my life
i don't know that a person needs to be called 'excited' because he demands explanations that are his simple due  what in the world do you want me to explain  your conduct with fred kinney george shouted
lucy uttered a sudden cry of laughter she was delighted
it's been awful she said
i don't know that i ever heard of worse misbehaviour
papa and i have been twice to dinner with his family and i've been three times to church with fredand once to the circus
i don't know when they'll be here to arrest me  stop that george commanded fiercely
i want to know just one thing and i mean to know it too  whether i enjoyed the circus  i want to know if you're engaged to him  no she cried and lifting her face close to his for the shortest instant possible she gave him a look half merry half defiant but all fond
it was an adorable look
lucy he said huskily
but she turned quickly from him and ran to the other end of the room
he followed awkwardly stammering  lucy i wanti want to ask you
will youwill youwill you be engaged to me  she stood at a window seeming to look out into the summer darkness her back to him
will you lucy  no she murmured just audibly
why not  i'm older than you  eight months  you're too young  is that he said gulpingis that the only reason you won't  she did not answer
as she stood persistently staring out of the window with her back to him she did not see how humble his attitude had become but his voice was low and it shook so that she could have no doubt of his emotion
lucy please forgive me for making such a row he said thus gently
i've beeni've been terribly upsetterribly
you know how i feel about you and always have felt about you
i've shown it in every single thing i've done since the first time i met you and i know you know it
don't you  still she did not move or speak
is the only reason you won't be engaged to me you think i'm too young lucy  it'sit's reason enough she said faintly
at that he caught one of her hands and she turned to him there were tears in her eyes tears which he did not understand at all
lucy you little dear he cried
i knew you  no no she said and she pushed him away withdrawing her hand
george let's not talk of solemn things  solemn things'
like what  likebeing engaged  but george had become altogether jubilant and he laughed triumphantly
good gracious that isn't solemn  it is too she said wiping her eyes
it's too solemn for us  no it isn't
i  let's sit down and be sensible dear she said
you sit over there  i will if you'll call me 'dear' again  no she said
i'll only call you that once again this summerthe night before you go away  that will have to do then he laughed so long as i know we're engaged  but we're not she protested
and we never will be if you don't promise not to speak of it again untiluntil i tell you to  i won't promise that said the happy george
i'll only promise not to speak of it till the next time you call me 'dear' and you've promised to call me that the night before i leave for my senior year  oh but i didn't she said earnestly then hesitated
did i  didn't you  i don't think i meant it she murmured her wet lashes flickering above troubled eyes
i know one thing about you he said gayly his triumph increasing
you never went back on anything you said yet and i'm not afraid of this being the first time  but we mustn't let she faltered then went on tremulously george we've got on so well together we won't let this make a difference between us will we and she joined in his laughter
it will all depend on what you tell me the night before i go away
you agree we're going to settle things then don't you lucy  i don't promise  yes you do
don't you  well     chapter xiii    tonight george began a jubilant warfare upon his aunt fanny opening the campaign upon his return home at about eleven o'clock
fanny had retired and was presumably asleep but george on the way to his own room paused before her door and serenaded her in a full baritone      as i walk along the boy de balong      with my independent air      the people all declare      'he must be a millionaire'
oh you hear them sigh and wish to die      and see them wink the other eye
at the man that broke the bank at monte carlo  isabel came from george's room where she had been reading waiting for him
i'm afraid you'll disturb your father dear
i wish you'd sing more thoughin the daytime
you have a splendid voice  goodnight old lady  i thought perhaps ididn't you want me to come in with you and talk a little  not tonight
you go to bed
goodnight old lady  he kissed her hilariously entered his room with a skip closed his door noisily and then he could be heard tossing things about loudly humming the man that broke the bank at monte carlo  smiling his mother knelt outside his door to pray then with her amen pressed her lips to the bronze doorknob and went silently to her own apartment
after breakfasting in bed george spent the next morning at his grandfather's and did not encounter his aunt fanny until lunch when she seemed to be ready for him
thank you so much for the serenade george she said
your poor father tells me he'd just got to sleep for the first time in two nights but after your kind attentions he lay awake the rest of last night  perfectly true mr minafer said grimly
of course i didn't know sir george hastened to assure him
i'm awfully sorry
but aunt fanny was so gloomy and excited before i went out last evening i thought she needed cheering up  i fanny jeered
i was gloomy
i was excited
you mean about that engagement  yes
weren't you
i thought i heard you worrying over somebody's being engaged
didn't i hear you say you'd heard mr eugene morgan was engaged to marry some pretty little seventeenyearold girl  fanny was stung but she made a brave effort
did you ask lucy she said her voice almost refusing the teasing laugh she tried to make it utter
did you ask her when fred kinney and she  yes
that story wasn't true
but the other one here he stared at fanny and then affected dismay
why what's the matter with your face aunt fanny
it seems agitated  agitated fanny said disdainfully but her voice undeniably lacked steadiness
agitated  oh come mr minafer interposed
let's have a little peace  i'm willing said george
i don't want to see poor aunt fanny all stirred up over a rumour i just this minute invented myself
she's so excitableabout certain subjectsit's hard to control her he turned to his mother
what's the matter with grandfather  didn't you see him this morning isabel asked
yes
he was glad to see me and all that but he seemed pretty fidgety
has he been having trouble with his heart again  not lately
no  well he's not himself
i tried to talk to him about the estate it's disgracefulit really isthe way things are looking
he wouldn't listen and he seemed upset
what's he upset over  isabel looked serious however it was her husband who suggested gloomily i suppose the major's bothered about this sydney and amelia business most likely  what sydney and amelia business george asked
your mother can tell you if she wants to minafer said
it's not my side of the family so i keep off  it's rather disagreeable for all of us georgie isabel began
you see your uncle sydney wanted a diplomatic position and he thought brother george being in congress could arrange it
george did get him the offer of a south american ministry but sydney wanted a european ambassadorship and he got quite indignant with poor george for thinking he'd take anything smallerand he believes george didn't work hard enough for him
george had done his best of course and now he's out of congress and won't run againso there's sydney's idea of a big diplomatic position gone for good
well sydney and your aunt amelia are terribly disappointed and they say they've been thinking for years that this town isn't really fit to live in'for a gentleman' sydney saysand it is getting rather big and dirty
so they've sold their house and decided to go abroad to live permanently there's a villa near florence they've often talked of buying
and they want father to let them have their share of the estate now instead of waiting for him to leave it to them in his will  well i suppose that's fair enough george said
that is in case he intended to leave them a certain amount in his will  of course that's understood georgie
father explained his will to us long ago a third to them and a third to brother george and a third to us  her son made a simple calculation in his mind
uncle george was a bachelor and probably would never marry sydney and amelia were childless
the major's only grandchild appeared to remain the eventual heir of the entire property no matter if the major did turn over to sydney a third of it now
and george had a fragmentary vision of himself in mourning arriving to take possession of a historic florentine villahe saw himself walking up a cypressbordered path with ancient carven stone balustrades in the distance and servants in mourning livery greeting the new signore
well i suppose it's grandfather's own affair
he can do it or not just as he likes
i don't see why he'd mind much  he seemed rather confused and pained about it isabel said
i think they oughtn't to urge it
george says that the estate won't stand taking out the third that sydney wants and that sydney and amelia are behaving like a couple of pigs she laughed continuing of course i don't know whether they are or not i never have understood any more about business myself than a little pig would
but i'm on george's side whether he's right or wrong i always was from the time we were children and sydney and amelia are hurt with me about it i'm afraid
they've stopped speaking to george entirely
poor father family rows at his time of life  george became thoughtful
if sydney and amelia were behaving like pigs things might not be so simple as at first they seemed to be
uncle sydney and aunt amelia might live an awful long while he thought and besides people didn't always leave their fortunes to relatives
sydney might die first leaving everything to his widow and some curlyhaired italian adventurer might get round her over there in florence she might be fool enough to marry againor even adopt somebody
he became more and more thoughtful forgetting entirely a plan he had formed for the continued teasing of his aunt fanny and an hour after lunch he strolled over to his grandfather's intending to apply for further information as a party rightfully interested
he did not carry out this intention however
going into the big house by a side entrance he was informed that the major was upstairs in his bedroom that his sons sydney and george were both with him and that a serious argument was in progress
you kin stan' right in de middle dat big sta'yway said old sam the ancient negro who was his informant an' you kin heah all you amind to wivout goin' on up no fudda
mist' sydney an' mist' jawge talkin' louduh'n i evuh heah nobody ca'y on in nish heah house
quollin' honey big quollin'  all right said george shortly
you go on back to your own part of the house and don't make any talk
hear me  yessuh yessuh sam chuckled as he shuffled away
plenty talkin' wivout sam
yessuh  george went to the foot of the great stairway
he could hear angry voices overheadthose of his two unclesand a plaintive murmur as if the major tried to keep the peace
such sounds were far from encouraging to callers and george decided not to go upstairs until this interview was over
his decision was the result of no timidity nor of a too sensitive delicacy
what he felt was that if he interrupted the scene in his grandfather's room just at this time one of the three gentlemen engaging in it might speak to him in a peremptory manner in the heat of the moment and george saw no reason for exposing his dignity to such mischances
therefore he turned from the stairway and going quietly into the library picked up a magazinebut he did not open it for his attention was instantly arrested by his aunt amelia's voice speaking in the next room
the door was open and george heard her distinctly
isabel does
isabel she exclaimed her tone high and shrewish
you needn't tell me anything about isabel minafer i guess my dear old frank bronson
i know her a little better than you do don't you think  george heard the voice of mr bronson replyinga voice familiar to him as that of his grandfather's attorneyinchief and chief intimate as well
he was a contemporary of the major's being over seventy and they had been through three years of the war in the same regiment
amelia addressed him now with an effect of angry mockery as my dear old frank bronson but that without the mockery was how the amberson family almost always spoke of him dear old frank bronson he was a hale thin old man six feet three inches tall and without a stoop
i doubt your knowing isabel he said stiffly
you speak of her as you do because she sides with her brother george instead of with you and sydney  pooh aunt amelia was evidently in a passion
you know what's been going on over there well enough frank bronson  i don't even know what you're talking about  oh you don't
you don't know that isabel takes george's side simply because he's eugene morgan's best friend  it seems to me you're talking pure nonsense said bronson sharply
not impure nonsense i hope  amelia became shrill
i thought you were a man of the world don't tell me you're blind
for nearly two years isabel's been pretending to chaperone fanny minafer with eugene and all the time she's been dragging that poor fool fanny around to chaperone her and eugene
under the circumstances she knows people will get to thinking fanny's a pretty slim kind of chaperone and isabel wants to please george because she thinks there'll be less talk if she can keep her own brother around seeming to approve
'talk'
she'd better look out
the whole town will be talking the first thing she knows
she  amelia stopped and stared at the doorway in a panic for her nephew stood there
she kept her eyes upon his white face for a few strained moments then regaining her nerve looked away and shrugged her shoulders
you weren't intended to hear what i've been saying george she said quietly
but since you seem to  yes i did  so she shrugged her shoulders again
after all i don't know but it's just as well in the long run  he walked up to where she sat
youyou he said thickly
it seemsit seems to me you'reyou're pretty common  amelia tried to give the impression of an unconcerned person laughing with complete indifference but the sounds she produced were disjointed and uneasy
she fanned herself looking out of the open window near her
of course if you want to make more trouble in the family than we've already got george with your eavesdropping you can go and repeat  old bronson had risen from his chair in great distress
your aunt was talking nonsense because she's piqued over a business matter george  he said
she doesn't mean what she said and neither she nor any one else gives the slightest credit to such foolishnessno one in the world  george gulped and wet lines shone suddenly along his lower eyelids
theythey'd better not he said then stalked out of the room and out of the house
he stamped fiercely across the stone slabs of the front porch descended the steps and halted abruptly blinking in the strong sunshine
in front of his own gate beyond the major's broad lawn his mother was just getting into her victoria where sat already his aunt fanny and lucy morgan
it was a summer fashionpicture the three ladies charmingly dressed delicate parasols aloft the lines of the victoria graceful as those of a violin the trim pair of bays in glistening harness picked out with silver and the serious black driver whom isabel being an amberson dared even in that town to put into a black livery coat boots white breeches and cockaded hat
they jingled smartly away and seeing george standing on the major's lawn lucy waved and isabel threw him a kiss
but george shuddered pretending not to see them and stooped as if searching for something lost in the grass protracting that posture until the victoria was out of hearing
and ten minutes later george amberson somewhat in the semblance of an angry person plunging out of the mansion found a pale nephew waiting to accost him
i haven't time to talk georgie  yes you have
you'd better  what's the matter then  his namesake drew him away from the vicinity of the house
i want to tell you something i just heard aunt amelia say in there  i don't want to hear it said amberson
i've been hearing entirely too much of what 'aunt amelia says lately  she says my mother's on your side about this division of the property because you're eugene morgan's best friend  what in the name of heaven has that got to do with your mother's being on my side  she said george paused to swallow
she said he faltered
you look sick said his uncle and laughed shortly
if it's because of anything amelia's been saying i don't blame you
what else did she say  george swallowed again as with nausea but under his uncle's encouragement he was able to be explicit
she said my mother wanted you to be friendly to her about eugene morgan
she said my mother had been using aunt fanny as a chaperone  amberson emitted a laugh of disgust
it's wonderful what tommyrot a woman in a state of spite can think of
i suppose you don't doubt that amelia amberson created this specimen of tommyrot herself  i know she did  then what's the matter  she said george faltered again
she saidshe implied people werewere talking about it  of all the damn nonsense his uncle exclaimed
george looked at him haggardly
you're sure they're not  rubbish
your mother's on my side about this division because she knows sydney's a pig and always has been a pig and so has his spiteful wife
i'm trying to keep them from getting the better of your mother as well as from getting the better of me don't you suppose
well they're in a rage because sydney always could do what he liked with father unless your mother interfered and they know i got isabel to ask him not to do what they wanted
they're keeping up the fight and they're soreand amelia's a woman who always says any damn thing that comes into her head
that's all there is to it  but she said george persisted wretchedly she said there was talk
she said  look here young fellow amberson laughed goodnaturedly
there probably is some harmless talk about the way your aunt fanny goes after poor eugene and i've no doubt i've abetted it myself
people can't help being amused by a thing like that
fanny was always languishing at him twentyodd years ago before he left here
well we can't blame the poor thing if she's got her hopes up again and i don't know that i blame her myself for using your mother the way she does  how do you mean  amberson put his hand on george's shoulder
you like to tease fanny  he said but i wouldn't tease her about this if i were you
fanny hasn't got much in her life
you know georgie just being an aunt isn't really the great career it may sometimes appear to you
in fact i don't know of anything much that fanny has got except her feeling about eugene
she's always had itand what's funny to us is pretty much lifeanddeath to her i suspect
now i'll not deny that eugene morgan is attracted to your mother
he is and that's another case of 'always was' but i know him and he's a knight georgea crazy one perhaps if you've read 'don quixote'
and i think your mother likes him better than she likes any man outside her own family and that he interests her more than anybody elseand 'always has'
and that's all there is to it except  except what george asked quickly as he paused
except that i suspect amberson chuckled and began over i'll tell you in confidence
i think fanny's a fairly tricky customer for such an innocent old girl
there isn't any real harm in her but she's a great diplomatistlots of cards up her lace sleeves georgie
by the way did you ever notice how proud she is of her arms
always flashing 'em at poor eugene and he stopped to laugh again
i don't see anything confidential about that george complained
i thought  wait a minute
my idea isdon't forget it's a confidential one but i'm devilish right about it young georgieit's this fanny uses your mother for a decoy duck
she does everything in the world she can to keep your mother's friendship with eugene going because she thinks that's what keeps eugene about the place so to speak
fanny's always with your mother you see and whenever he sees isabel he sees fanny
fanny thinks he'll get used to the idea of her being around and some day her chance may come
you see she's probably afraidperhaps she even knows poor thingthat she wouldn't get to see much of eugene if it weren't for isabel's being such a friend of his
there
d'you see  welli suppose so george's brow was still dark however
if you're sure whatever talk there is is about aunt fanny
if that's so  don't be an ass his uncle advised him lightly moving away
i'm off for a week's fishing to forget that woman in there and her pig of a husband his gesture toward the mansion indicated mr and mrs sydney amberson
i recommend a like course to you if you're silly enough to pay any attention to such rubbishings
goodbye  george was partially reassured but still troubled a word haunted him like the recollection of a nightmare
talk  he stood looking at the houses across the street from the mansion and though the sunshine was bright upon them they seemed mysteriously threatening
he had always despised them except the largest of them which was the home of his henchman charlie johnson
the johnsons had originally owned a lot three hundred feet wide but they had sold all of it except the meager frontage before the house itself and five houses were now crowded into the space where one used to squire it so spaciously
up and down the street the same transformation had taken place every big comfortable old brick house now had two or three smaller frame neighbours crowding up to it on each side cheaplooking neighbours most of them needing paint and not cleanand yet though they were cheap looking they had cost as much to build as the big brick houses whose former ample yards they occupied
only where george stood was there left a sward as of yore the great level green lawn that served for both the major's house and his daughter's
this serene domainunbroken except for the two gravelled carriagedrivesalone remained as it had been during the early glories of the amberson addition
george stared at the ugly houses opposite and hated them more than ever but he shivered
perhaps the riffraff living in those houses sat at the windows to watch their betters perhaps they dared to gossip  he uttered an exclamation and walked rapidly toward his own front gate
the victoria had returned with miss fanny alone she jumped out briskly and the victoria waited
where's mother george asked sharply as he met her
at lucy's
i only came back to get some embroidery because we found the sun too hot for driving
i'm in a hurry  but going into the house with her he detained her when she would have hastened upstairs
i haven't time to talk now georgie i'm going right back
i promised your mother  you listen said george
what on earth  he repeated what amelia had said
this time however he spoke coldly and without the emotion he had exhibited during the recital to his uncle fanny was the one who showed agitation during this interview for she grew fiery red and her eyes dilated
what on earth do you want to bring such trash to me for she demanded breathing fast
i merely wished to know two things whether it is your duty or mine to speak to father of what aunt amelia  fanny stamped her foot
you little fool she cried
you awful little fool  i decline  decline my hat
your father's a sick man and you  he doesn't seem so to me  well he does to me
and you want to go troubling him with an amberson family row
it's just what that cat would love you to do  well i  tell your father if you like
it will only make him a little sicker to think he's got a son silly enough to listen to such craziness  then you're sure there isn't any talk fanny disdained a reply in words
she made a hissing sound of utter contempt and snapped her fingers
then she asked scornfully what's the other thing you wanted to know  george's pallor increased
whether it mightn't be better under the circumstances he said if this family were not so intimate with the morgan familyat least for a time
it might be better  fanny stared at him incredulously
you mean you'd quit seeing lucy  i hadn't thought of that side of it but if such a thing were necessary on account of talk about my mother ii he hesitated unhappily
i suggested that if all of usfor a timeperhaps only for a timeit might be better if  see here she interrupted
we'll settle this nonsense right now
if eugene morgan comes to this house for instance to see me your mother can't get up and leave the place the minute he gets here can she
what do you want her to do insult him
or perhaps you'd prefer she'd insult lucy
that would do just as well
what is it you're up to anyhow
do you really love your aunt amelia so much that you want to please her
or do you really hate your aunt fanny so much that you want tothat you want to  she choked and sought for her handkerchief suddenly she began to cry
oh see here george said
i don't hate you aunt fanny
that's silly
i don't  you do
you do
you want toyou want to destroy the only thingthat ithat i ever and unable to continue she became inaudible in her handkerchief
george felt remorseful and his own troubles were lightened all at once it became clear to him that he had been worrying about nothing
he perceived that his aunt amelia was indeed an old cat and that to give her scandalous meanderings another thought would be the height of folly
by no means unsusceptible to such pathos as that now exposed before him he did not lack pity for fanny whose almost spoken confession was lamentable and he was granted the vision to understand that his mother also pitied fanny infinitely more than he did
this seemed to explain everything
he patted the unhappy lady awkwardly upon her shoulder
there there  he said
i didn't mean anything
of course the only thing to do about aunt amelia is to pay no attention to her
it's all right aunt fanny
don't cry
i feel a lot better now myself
come on i'll drive back there with you
it's all over and nothing's the matter
can't you cheer up  fanny cheered up and presently the customarily hostile aunt and nephew were driving out amberson boulevard amiably together in the hot sunshine
chapter xiv    almost was lucy's last word on the last night of george's vacationthat vital evening which she had half consented to agree upon for settling things between them
almost engaged she meant
and george discontented with the almost but contented that she seemed glad to wear a sapphire locket with a tiny photograph of george amberson minafer inside it found himself wonderful in a new world at the final instant of their parting
for after declining to let him kiss her goodbye as if his desire for such a ceremony were the most preposterous absurdity in the world she had leaned suddenly close to him and left upon his cheek the veriest feather from a fairy's wing
she wrote him a month later  no
it must keep on being almost
isn't almost pretty pleasant
you know well enough that i care for you
i did from the first minute i saw you and i'm pretty sure you knew iti'm afraid you did
i'm afraid you always knew it
i'm not conventional and cautious about being engaged as you say i am dear
i always read over the dears in your letters a time or two as you say you do in mineonly i read all of your letters a time or two
but it's such a solemn thing it scares me
it means a good deal to a lot of people besides you and me and that scares me too
you write that i take your feeling for me too lightly and that i take the whole affair too lightly isn't that odd
because to myself i seem to take it as something so much more solemn than you do
i shouldn't be a bit surprised to find myself an old lady some day still thinking of youwhile you'd be away and away with somebody else perhaps and me forgotten ages ago
lucy morgan you'd say when you saw my obituary
lucy morgan
let me see i seem to remember the name
didn't i know some lucy morgan or other once upon a time then you'd shake your big white head and stroke your long white beardyou'd have such a distinguished long white beard
and you'd say 'no
i don't seem to remember any lucy morgan i wonder what made me think i did'
and poor me
i'd be deep in the ground wondering if you'd heard about it and what you were saying
goodbye for today
don't work too harddear
george immediately seized pen and paper plaintively but vigorously requesting lucy not to imagine him with a beard distinguished or otherwise even in the extremities of age
then after inscribing his protest in the matter of this visioned beard he concluded his missive in a tone mollified to tenderness and proceeded to read a letter from his mother which had reached him simultaneously with lucy's
isabel wrote from asheville where she had just arrived with her husband
i think your father looks better already darling though we've been here only a few hours it may be we've found just the place to build him up
the doctors said they hoped it would prove to be and if it is it would be worth the long struggle we had with him to get him to give up and come
poor dear man he was so blue not about his health but about giving up the worries down at his office and forgetting them for a timeif he only will forget them
it took the pressure of the family and all his best friends to get him to comebut father and brother george and fanny and eugene morgan all kept at him so constantly that he just had to give in
i'm afraid that in my anxiety to get him to do what the doctors wanted him to i wasn't able to back up brother george as i should in his difficulty with sydney and amelia
i'm so sorry
george is more upset than i've ever seen himthey've got what they wanted and they're sailing before long i hear to live in florence
father said he couldn't stand the constant persuadingi'm afraid the word he used was nagging i can't understand people behaving like that
george says they may be ambersons but they're vulgar
i'm afraid i almost agree with him
at least i think they were inconsiderate
but i don't see why i'm unburdening myself of all this to you poor darling
we'll have forgotten all about it long before you come home for the holidays and it should mean little or nothing to you anyway
forget that i've been so foolish
your father is waiting for me to take a walk with himthat's a splendid sign because he hasn't felt he could walk much at home lately
i mustn't keep him waiting
be careful to wear your mackintosh and rubbers in rainy weather and as soon as it begins to get colder your ulster
wish you could see your father now
looks so much better
we plan to stay six weeks if the place agrees with him
it does really seem to already
he's just called in the door to say he's waiting
don't smoke too much darling boy
devotedly your mother isabel
but she did not keep her husband there for the six weeks she anticipated
she did not keep him anywhere that long
three weeks after writing this letter she telegraphed suddenly to george that they were leaving for home at once and four days later when he and a friend came whistling into his study from lunch at the club he found another telegram upon his desk
he read it twice before he comprehended its import
papa left us at ten this morning dearest
mother
the friend saw the change in his face
not bad news  george lifted utterly dumfounded eyes from the yellow paper
my father he said weakly
she saysshe says he's dead
i've got to go home  his uncle george and the major met him at the station when he arrivedthe first time the major had ever come to meet his grandson
the old gentleman sat in his closed carriage which still needed paint at the entrance to the station but he got out and advanced to grasp george's hand tremulously when the latter appeared
poor fellow he said and patted him repeatedly upon the shoulder
poor fellow
poor georgie  george had not yet come to a full realization of his loss so far his condition was merely dazed and as the major continued to pat him murmuring poor fellow over and over george was seized by an almost irresistible impulse to tell his grandfather that he was not a poodle
but he said thanks in a low voice and got into the carriage his two relatives following with deferential sympathy
he noticed that the major's tremulousness did not disappear as they drove up the street and that he seemed much feebler than during the summer
principally however george was concerned with his own emotion or rather with his lack of emotion and the anxious sympathy of his grandfather and his uncle made him feel hypocritical
he was not griefstricken but he felt that he ought to be and with a secret shame concealed his callousness beneath an affectation of solemnity
but when he was taken into the room where lay what was left of wilbur minafer george had no longer to pretend his grief was sufficient
it needed only the sight of that forever inert semblance of the quiet man who had been always so quiet a part of his son's lifeso quiet a part that george had seldom been consciously aware that his father was indeed a part of his life
as the figure lay there its very quietness was what was most lifelike and suddenly it struck george hard
and in that unexpected racking grief of his son wilbur minafer became more vividly george's father than he had ever been in life
when george left the room his arm was about his blackrobed mother his shoulders were still shaken with sobs
he leaned upon his mother she gently comforted him and presently he recovered his composure and became selfconscious enough to wonder if he had not been making an unmanly display of himself
i'm all right again mother he said awkwardly
don't worry about me you'd better go lie down or something you look pretty pale  isabel did look pretty pale but not ghastly pale as fanny did
fanny's grief was overwhelming she stayed in her room and george did not see her until the next day a few minutes before the funeral when her haggard face appalled him
but by this time he was quite himself again and during the short service in the cemetery his thoughts even wandered so far as to permit him a feeling of regret not directly connected with his father
beyond the open flowerwalled grave was a mound where new grass grew and here lay his greatuncle old john minafer who had died the previous autumn and beyond this were the graves of george's grandfather and grandmother minafer and of his grandfather minafer's second wife and her three sons george's halfuncles who had been drowned together in a canoe accident when george was a childfanny was the last of the family
next beyond was the amberson family lot where lay the major's wife and their sons henry and milton uncles whom george dimly remembered and beside them lay isabel's older sister his aunt estelle who had died in her girlhood long before george was born
the minafer monument was a granite block with the name chiseled upon its one polished side and the amberson monument was a white marble shaft taller than any other in that neighbourhood
but farther on there was a newer section of the cemetery an addition which had been thrown open to occupancy only a few years before after dexterous modern treatment by a landscape specialist
there were some large new mausoleums here and shafts taller than the ambersons' as well as a number of monuments of some sculptural pretentiousness and altogether the new section appeared to be a more fashionable and important quarter than that older one which contained the amberson and minafer lots
this was what caused george's regret during the moment or two when his mind strayed from his father and the reading of the service
on the train going back to college ten days later this regret though it was as much an annoyance as a regret recurred to his mind and a feeling developed within him that the new quarter of the cemetery was in bad tastenot architecturally or sculpturally perhaps but in presumption it seemed to flaunt a kind of parvenu ignorance as if it were actually pleased to be unaware that all the aristocratic and really important families were buried in the old section
the annoyance gave way before a recollection of the sweet mournfulness of his mother's face as she had said goodbye to him at the station and of how lovely she looked in her mourning
he thought of lucy whom he had seen only twice and he could not help feeling that in these quiet interviews he had appeared to her as tinged with heroismshe had shown rather than said how brave she thought him in his sorrow
but what came most vividly to george's mind during these retrospections was the despairing face of his aunt fanny
again and again he thought of it he could not avoid its haunting
and for days after he got back to college the stricken likeness of fanny would appear before him unexpectedly and without a cause that he could trace in his immediately previous thoughts
her grief had been so silent yet it had so amazed him
george felt more and more compassion for this ancient antagonist of his and he wrote to his mother about her  i'm afraid poor aunt fanny might think now father's gone we won't want her to live with us any longer and because i always teased her so much she might think i'd be for turning her out
i don't know where on earth she'd go or what she could live on if we did do something like this and of course we never would do such a thing but i'm pretty sure she had something of the kind on her mind
she didn't say anything but the way she looked is what makes me think so
honestly to me she looked just scared sick
you tell her there isn't any danger in the world of my treating her like that
tell her everything is to go on just as it always has
tell her to cheer up
chapter xv    isabel did more for fanny than telling her to cheer up
everything that fanny inherited from her father old aleck minafer had been invested in wilbur's business and wilbur's business after a period of illness corresponding in dates to the illness of wilbur's body had died just before wilbur did
george amberson and fanny were both wiped out to a miracle of precision as amberson said
they owned not a penny and owed not a penny he continued explaining his phrase
it's like the moment just before drowning you're not under water and you're not out of it
all you know is that you're not dead yet  he spoke philosophically having his prospects from his father to fall back upon but fanny had neither prospects nor philosophy
however a legal survey of wilbur's estate revealed the fact that his life insurance was left clear of the wreck and isabel with the cheerful consent of her son promptly turned this salvage over to her sisterinlaw
invested it would yield something better than nine hundred dollars a year and thus she was assured of becoming neither a pauper nor a dependent but proved to be as amberson said adding his efforts to the cheering up of fanny an heiress after all in spite of rolling mills and the devil she was unable to smile and he continued his humane gayeties
see what a wonderfully desirable income nine hundred dollars is fanny a bachelor to be in your class must have exactly fortynine thousand one hundred a year
then you see all you need to do in order to have fifty thousand a year is to be a little encouraging when some bachelor in your class begins to show by his haberdashery what he wants you to think about him  she looked at him wanly murmured a desolate responseshe had sewing to doand left the room while amberson shook his head ruefully at his sister
i've often thought that humor was not my forte he sighed
lord
she doesn't 'cheer up' much  the collegian did not return to his home for the holidays
instead isabel joined him and they went south for the two weeks
she was proud of her stalwart goodlooking son at the hotel where they stayed and it was meat and drink to her when she saw how people stared at him in the lobby and on the big verandasindeed her vanity in him was so dominant that she was unaware of their staring at her with more interest and an admiration friendlier than george evoked
happy to have him to herself for this fortnight she loved to walk with him leaning upon his arm to read with him to watch the sea with himperhaps most of all she liked to enter the big dining room with him
yet both of them felt constantly the difference between this christmastime and other christmastimes of theirsin all it was a sorrowful holiday
but when isabel came east for george's commencement in june she brought lucy with herand things began to seem different especially when george amberson arrived with lucy's father on class day
eugene had been in new york on business amberson easily persuaded him to this outing and they made a cheerful party of it with the new graduate of course the hero and center of it all
his uncle was a fellow alumnus
yonder was where i roomed when i was here he said pointing out one of the university buildings to eugene
i don't know whether george would let my admirers place a tablet to mark the spot or not
he owns all these buildings now you know  didn't you when you were here
like uncle like nephew  don't tell george you think he's like me
just at this time we should be careful of the young gentleman's feelings  yes said eugene
if we weren't he mightn't let us exist at all  i'm sure i didn't have it so badly at his age amberson said reflectively as they strolled on through the commencement crowd
for one thing i had brothers and sisters and my mother didn't just sit at my feet as george's does and i wasn't an only grandchild either
father's always spoiled georgie a lot more than he did any of his own' children  eugene laughed
you need only three things to explain all that's good and bad about georgie  three  he's isabel's only child
he's an amberson
he's a boy  well mister bones of these three things which are the good ones and which are the bad ones  all of them said eugene
it happened that just then they came in sight of the subject of their discourse
george was walking under the elms with lucy swinging a stick and pointing out to her various objects and localities which had attained historical value during the last four years
the two older men marked his gestures careless and graceful they observed his attitude unconsciously noble his easy proprietorship of the ground beneath his feet and round about of the branches overhead of the old buildings beyond and of lucy
i don't know eugene said smiling whimsically
i don't know
when i spoke of his being a human beingi don't know
perhaps it's more like deity  i wonder if i was like that 'amberson groaned'
you don't suppose every amberson has had to go through it do you  don't worry
at least half of it is a combination of youth good looks and college and even the noblest ambersons get over their nobility and come to be people in time
it takes more than time though  i should say it did take more than time his friend agreed shaking a rueful head
then they walked over to join the loveliest amberson whom neither time nor trouble seemed to have touched
she stood alone thoughtful under the great trees chaperoning george and lucy at a distance but seeing the two friends approaching she came to meet them
it's charming isn't it she said moving her blackgloved hand to indicate the summery dressed crowd strolling about them or clustering in groups each with its own hero
they seem so eager and so confident all these boysit's touching
but of course youth doesn't know it's touching  amberson coughed
no it doesn't seem to take itself as pathetic precisely
eugene and i were just speaking of something like that
do you know what i think whenever i see these smooth triumphal young faces
i always think 'oh how you're going to catch it'  george  oh yes he said
life's most ingenious it's got a special walloping for every mother's son of 'em  maybe said isabel troubledmaybe some of the mothers can take the walloping for them  not one her brother assured her with emphasis
not any more than she can take on her own face the lines that are bound to come on her son's
i suppose you know that all these young faces have got to get lines on 'em  maybe they won't she said smiling wistfully
maybe times will change and nobody will have to wear lines  times have changed like that for only one person that i know eugene said
and as isabel looked inquiring he laughed and she saw that she was the only one person his implication was justified moreover and she knew it
she blushed charmingly
which is it puts the lines on the faces amberson asked
is it age or trouble
of course we can't decide that wisdom does itwe must be polite to isabel  i'll tell you what puts the lines there eugene said
age puts some and trouble puts some and work puts some but the deepest are carved by lack of faith
the serenest brow is the one that believes the most  in what isabel asked gently
in everything  she looked at him inquiringly and he laughed as he had a moment before when she looked at him that way
oh yes you do he said
she continued to look at him inquiringly a moment or two longer and there was an unconscious earnestness in her glance something trustful as well as inquiring as if she knew that whatever he meant it was all right
then her eyes drooped thoughtfully and she seemed to address some inquiries to herself
she looked up suddenly
why i believe she said in a tone of surprise i believe i do  and at that both men laughed
isabel her brother exclaimed
you're a foolish person
there are times when you look exactly fourteen years old  but this reminded her of her real affair in that part of the world
good gracious she said
where have the children got to
we must take lucy pretty soon so that george can go and sit with the class
we must catch up with them  she took her brother's arm and the three moved on looking about them in the crowd
curious amberson remarked as they did not immediately discover the young people they sought
even in such a concourse one would think we couldn't fail to see the proprietor  several hundred proprietors today eugene suggested
no they're only proprietors of the university said george's uncle
we're looking for the proprietor of the universe  there he is cried isabel fondly not minding this satire at all
and doesn't he look it  her escorts were still laughing at her when they joined the proprietor of the universe and his pretty friend and though both amberson and eugene declined to explain the cause of their mirth even upon lucy's urgent request the portents of the day were amiable and the five made a happy partythat is to say four of them made a happy audience for the fifth and the mood of this fifth was gracious and cheerful
george took no conspicuous part in either the academic or the social celebrations of his class he seemed to regard both sets of exercises with a tolerant amusement his own crowd not going in much for either of those sorts of things as he explained to lucy
what his crowd had gone in for remained ambiguous some negligent testimony indicating that except for an astonishing reliability which they all seemed to have attained in matters relating to musical comedy they had not gone in for anything
certainly the question one of them put to lucy in response to investigations of hers seemed to point that way don't you think he said really don't you think that being things is rather better than doing things  he said rahthuh bettuh for rather better and seemed to do it deliberately with perfect knowledge of what he was doing
later lucy mocked him to george and george refused to smile he somewhat inclined to such pronunciations himself
this inclination was one of the things that he had acquired in the four years
what else he had acquired it might have puzzled him to state had anybody asked him and required a direct reply within a reasonable space of time
he had learned how to pass examinations by cramming that is in three or four days and nights he could get into his head enough of a selected fragment of some scientific or philosophical or literary or linguistic subject to reply plausibly to six questions out of ten
he could retain the information necessary for such a feat just long enough to give a successful performance then it would evaporate utterly from his brain and leave him undisturbed
george like his crowd not only preferred being things to doing things but had contented himself with four years of being things as a preparation for going on being things and when lucy rather shyly pressed him for his friend's probable definition of the things it seemed so superior and beautiful to be george raised his eyebrows slightly meaning that she should have understood without explanation but he did explain oh family and all thatbeing a gentleman i suppose  lucy gave the horizon a long look but offered no comment
chapter xvi   aunt fanny doesn't look much better george said to his mother a few minutes after their arrival on the night they got home
he stood with a towel in her doorway concluding some sketchy ablutions before going downstairs to a supper which fanny was hastily preparing for them
isabel had not telegraphed fanny was taken by surprise when they drove up in a station cab at eleven o'clock and george instantly demanded a little decent food some criticisms of his had publicly disturbed the composure of the diningcar steward four hours previously
i never saw anybody take things so hard as she seems to he observed his voice muffled by the towel
doesn't she get over it at all
i thought she'd feel better when we turned over the insurance to hergave it to her absolutely without any strings to it
she looks about a thousand years old  she looks quite girlish sometimes though his mother said
has she looked that way much since father  not so much isabel said thoughtfully
but she will as times goes on  time'll have to hurry then it seems to me george observed returning to his own room
when they went down to the dining room he pronounced acceptable the salmon salad cold beef cheese and cake which fanny made ready for them without disturbing the servants
the journey had fatigued isabel she ate nothing but sat to observe with tired pleasure the manifestations of her son's appetite meanwhile giving her sisterinlaw a brief summary of the events of commencement
but presently she kissed them both goodnighttaking care to kiss george lightly upon the side of his head so as not to disturb his eatingand left aunt and nephew alone together
it never was becoming to her to look pale fanny said absently a few moments after isabel's departure
wha'd you say aunt fanny  nothing
i suppose your mother's been being pretty gay
going a lot  how could she george asked cheerfully
in mourning of course all she could do was just sit around and look on
that's all lucy could do either for the matter of that  i suppose so his aunt assented
how did lucy get home  george regarded her with astonishment
why on the train with the rest of us of course  i didn't mean that fanny explained
i meant from the station
did you drive out to their house with her before you came here  no
she drove home with her father of course  oh i see
so eugene came to the station to meet you  to meet us george echoed renewing his attack upon the salmon salad
how could he  i don't know what you mean fanny said drearily in the desolate voice that had become her habit
i haven't seen him while your mother's been away  naturally said george
he's been east himself  at this fanny's drooping eyelids opened wide
did you see him  well naturally since he made the trip home with us  he did she said sharply
he's been with you all the time  no only on the train and the last three days before we left
uncle george got him to come  fanny's eyelids drooped again and she sat silent until george pushed back his chair and lit a cigarette declaring his satisfaction with what she had provided
you're a fine housekeeper he said benevolently
you know how to make things look dainty as well as taste the right way
i don't believe you'd stay single very long if some of the bachelors and widowers around town could just once see  she did not hear him
it's a little odd she said
what's odd  your mother's not mentioning that mr morgan had been with you  didn't think of it i suppose said george carelessly and his benevolent mood increasing he conceived the idea that a little harmless rallying might serve to elevate his aunt's drooping spirits
i'll tell you something in confidence he said solemnly
she looked up startled
what  well it struck me that mr morgan was looking pretty absentminded most of the time and he certainly is dressing better than he used to
uncle george told me he heard that the automobile factory had been doing quite wellwon a race too
i shouldn't be a bit surprised if all the young fellow had been waiting for was to know he had an assured income before he proposed  what 'young fellow'  this young fellow morgan laughed george honestly aunt fanny i shouldn't be a bit surprised to have him request an interview with me any day and declare that his intentions are honourable and ask my permission to pay his addresses to you
what had i better tell him  fanny burst into tears
good heavens george cried
i was only teasing
i didn't mean  let me alone she said lifelessly and continuing to weep rose and began to clear away the dishes
please aunt fanny  just let me alone  george was distressed
i didn't mean anything aunt fanny
i didn't know you'd got so sensitive as all that  you'd better go up to bed she said desolately going on with her work and her weeping
anyhow he insisted do let these things wait
let the servants 'tend to the table in the morning  no  but why not  just let me alone  oh lord george groaned going to the door
there he turned
see here aunt fanny there's not a bit of use your bothering about those dishes tonight
what's the use of a butler and three maids if  just let me alone  he obeyed and could still hear a pathetic sniffing from the dining room as he went up the stairs
by george he grunted as he reached his own room and his thought was that living with a person so sensitive to kindly raillery might prove lugubrious
he whistled long and low then went to the window and looked through the darkness to the great silhouette of his grandfather's house
lights were burning over there upstairs probably his newly arrived uncle was engaged in talk with the major
george's glance lowered resting casually upon the indistinct ground and he beheld some vague shapes unfamiliar to him
formless heaps they seemed but without much curiosity he supposed that sewer connections or water pipes might be out of order making necessary some excavations
he hoped the work would not take long he hated to see that sweep of lawn made unsightly by trenches and lines of dirt even temporarily
not greatly disturbed however he pulled down the shade yawned and began to undress leaving further investigation for the morning
but in the morning he had forgotten all about it and raised his shade to let in the light without even glancing toward the ground
not until he had finished dressing did he look forth from his window and then his glance was casual
the next instant his attitude became electric and he gave utterance to a bellow of dismay
he ran from his room plunged down the stairs out of the front door and upon a nearer view of the destroyed lawn began to release profanity upon the breezeless summer air which remained unaffected
between his mother's house and his grandfather's excavations for the cellars of five new houses were in process each within a few feet of its neighbour
foundations of brick were being laid everywhere were piles of brick and stacked lumber and sand heaps and mortar' beds
it was sunday and so the workmen implicated in these defacings were denied what unquestionably they would have considered a treat but as the fanatic orator continued the monologue a gentleman in flannels emerged upward from one of the excavations and regarded him contemplatively
obtaining any relief nephew he inquired with some interest
you must have learned quite a number of those expressions in childhoodit's so long since i'd heard them i fancied they were obsolete  who wouldn't swear george demanded hotly
in the name of god what does grandfather mean doing such things  my private opinion is said amberson gravely he desires to increase his income by building these houses to rent  well in the name of god can't he increase his income any other way but this  in the name of god it would appear he couldn't  it's beastly
it's a damn degradation
it's a crime  i don't know about its being a crime said his uncle stepping over some planks to join him
it might be a mistake though
your mother said not to tell you until we got home so as not to spoil commencement for you
she rather feared you'd be upset  upset
oh my lord i should think i would be upset
he's in his second childhood
what did you let him do it for in the name of  make it in the name of heaven this time george it's sunday
well i thought myself it was a mistake  i should say so  yes said amberson
i wanted him to put up an apartment building instead of these houses  an apartment building
here  yes that was my idea  george struck his hands together despairingly
an apartment house
oh my lord  don't worry
your grandfather wouldn't listen to me but he'll wish he had some day
he says that people aren't going to live in miserable little flats when they can get a whole house with some grass in front and plenty of backyard behind
he sticks it out that apartment houses will never do in a town of this type and when i pointed out to him that a dozen or so of 'em already are doing he claimed it was just the novelty and that they'd all be empty as soon as people got used to 'em
so he's putting up these houses  is he getting miserly in his old age  hardly
look what he gave sydney and amelia  i don't mean he's a miser of course said george
heaven knows he's liberal enough with mother and me but why on earth didn't he sell something or other rather than do a thing like this  as a matter of fact amberson returned coolly i believe he has sold something or other from time to time  well in heaven's name george cried what did he do it for  to get money his uncle mildly replied
that's my deduction  i suppose you're jokingor trying to  that's the best way to look at it amberson said amiably
take the whole thing as a jokeand in the meantime if you haven't had your breakfast  i haven't  then if i were you i'd go in and gets some
andhe paused becoming seriousand if i were you i wouldn't say anything to your grandfather about this  i don't think i could trust myself to speak to him about it said george
i want to treat him respectfully because he is my grandfather but i don't believe i could if i talked to him about such a thing as this  and with a gesture of despair plainly signifying that all too soon after leaving bright college years behind him he had entered into the full tragedy of life george turned bitterly upon his heel and went into the house for his breakfast
his uncle with his head whimsically upon one side gazed after him not altogether unsympathetically then descended again into the excavation whence he had lately emerged
being a philosopher he was not surprised that afternoon in the course of a drive he took in the old carriage with the major when george was encountered upon the highway flashing along in his runabout with lucy beside him and pendennis doing better than three minutes
he seems to have recovered amberson remarked looks in the highest good spirits  i beg your pardon  your grandson amberson explained
he was inclined to melancholy this morning but seemed jolly enough just now when they passed us  what was he melancholy about
not getting remorseful about all the money he's spent at college was he the major chuckled feebly but with sufficient grimness
i wonder what he thinks i'm made of he concluded querulously
gold his son suggested adding gently and he's right about part of you father  what part  your heart  the major laughed ruefully
i suppose that may account for how heavy it feels sometimes nowadays
this town seems to be rolling right over that old heart you mentioned georgerolling over it and burying it under
when i think of those devilish workmen digging up my lawn yelling around my house  never mind father
don't think of it
when things are a nuisance it's a good idea not to keep remembering 'em  i try not to the old gentleman murmured
i try to keep remembering that i won't be remembering anything very long and somehow convinced that this thought was a mirthful one he laughed loudly and slapped his knee
not so very long now my boy he chuckled continuing to echo his own amusement
not so very long
not so very long     chapter xvii    young george paid his respects to his grandfather the following morning having been occupied with various affairs and engagements on sunday until after the major's bedtime and topics concerned with building or excavations were not introduced into the conversation which was a cheerful one until george lightly mentioned some new plans of his
he was a skillful driver as the major knew and he spoke of his desire to extend his proficiency in this art in fact be entertained the ambition to drive a fourinhand
however as the major said nothing and merely sat still looking surprised george went on to say that he did not propose to go in for coaching just at the start he thought it would be better to begin with a tandem
he was sure pendennis could be trained to work as a leader and all that one needed to buy at present he said would be comparatively inexpensivea new trap and the harness of course and a good bay to match pendennis he did not care for a special groom one of the stablemen would do
at this point the major decided to speak
you say one of the stablemen would do he inquired his widened eyes remaining fixed upon his grandson
that's lucky because one's all there is just at present george
old fat tom does it all
didn't you notice when you took pendennis out yesterday  oh that will be all right sir
my mother can lend me her man  can she the old gentleman smiled faintly
i wonder he paused
what sir  whether you mightn't care to go to lawschool somewhere perhaps
i'd be glad to set aside a sum that would see you through  this senile divergence from the topic in hand surprised george painfully
i have no interest whatever in the law he said
i don't care for it and the idea of being a professional man has never appealed to me
none of the family has ever gone in for that sort of thing to my knowledge and i don't care to be the first
i was speaking of driving a tandem  i know you were the major said quietly
george looked hurt
i beg your pardon
of course if the idea doesn't appeal to you and he rose to go
the major ran a tremulous hand through his hair sighing deeply
ii don't like to refuse you anything georgie he said
i don't know that i often have refused you whatever you wantedin reason  you've always been more than generous sir george interrupted quickly
and if the idea of a tandem doesn't appeal to you whyof course and he waved his hand heroically dismissing the tandem
the major's distress became obvious
georgie i'd like to butbut i've an idea tandems are dangerous to drive and your mother might be anxious
she  no sir i think not
she felt it would be rather a good thinghelp to keep me out in the open air
but if perhaps your finances  oh it isn't that so much the old gentleman said hurriedly
i wasn't thinking of that altogether he laughed uncomfortably
i guess we could still afford a new horse or two if need be  i thought you said  the major waved his hand airily
oh a few retrenchments where things were useless nothing gained by a raft of idle darkies in the stablenor by a lot of extra land that might as well be put to work for us in rentals
and if you want this thing so very much  it's not important enough to bother about really of course  well let's wait till autumn then said the major in a tone of relief
we'll see about it in the autumn if you're still in the mind for it then
that will be a great deal better
you remind me of it along in septemberor october
we'll see what can be done he rubbed his hands cheerfully
we'll see what can be done about it then georgie
we'll see  and george in reporting this conversation to his mother was ruefully humorous
in fact the old boy cheered up so much he told her you'd have thought he'd got a real load off his mind
he seemed to think he'd fixed me up perfectly and that i was just as good as driving a tandem around his library right that minute
of course i know he's anything but miserly still i can't help thinking he must be salting a lot of money away
i know prices are higher than they used to be but he doesn't spend within thousands of what he used to and we certainly can't be spending more than we always have spent
where does it all go to
uncle george told me grandfather had sold some pieces of property and it looks a little queer
if he's really 'property poor' of course we ought to be more saving than we are and help him out
i don't mind giving up a tandem if it seems a little too expensive just now
i'm perfectly willing to live quietly till he gets his bank balance where he wants it
but i have a faint suspicion not that he's getting miserlynot that at allbut that old age has begun to make him timid about money
there's no doubt about it he's getting a little queer he can't keep his mind on a subject long
right in the middle of talking about one thing he'll wander off to something else and i shouldn't be surprised if he turned out to be a lot better off than any of us guess
it's entirely possible that whatever he's sold just went into government bonds or even his safety deposit box
there was a friend of mine in college had an old uncle like that made the whole family think he was poor as dirtand then left seven millions
people get terribly queer as they get old sometimes and grandfather certainly doesn't act the way he used to
he seems to be a totally different man
for instance he said he thought tandem driving might be dangerous  did he isabel asked quickly
then i'm glad he doesn't want you to have one
i didn't dream  but it's not
there isn't the slightest  isabel had a bright idea
georgie
instead of a tandem wouldn't it interest you to get one of eugene's automobiles  i don't think so
they're fast enough of course
in fact running one of those things is getting to be quite on the cards for sport and people go all over the country in 'em
but they're dirty things and they keep getting out of order so that you're always lying down on your back in the mud and  oh no she interrupted eagerly
haven't you noticed
you don't see nearly so many people doing that nowadays as you did two or three years ago and when you do eugene says it's apt to be one of the older patterns
the way they make them now you can get at most of the machinery from the top
i do think you'd be interested dear  george remained indifferent
possiblybut i hardly think so
i know a lot of good people are really taking them up but still  but still' what she said as he paused
but stillwell i suppose i'm a little oldfashioned and fastidious but i'm afraid being a sort of engine driver never will appeal to me mother
it's exciting and i'd like that part of it but still it doesn't seem to me precisely the thing a gentleman ought to do
too much overalls and monkeywrenches and grease  but eugene says people are hiring mechanics to do all that sort of thing for them
they're beginning to have them just the way they have coachmen and he says it's developing into quite a profession  i know that mother of course but i've seen some of these mechanics and they're not very satisfactory
for one thing most of them only pretend to understand the machinery and they let people break down a hundred miles from nowhere so that about all these fellows are good for is to hunt up a farmer and hire a horse to pull the automobile
and friends of mine at college that've had a good deal of experience tell me the mechanics who do understand the engines have no training at all as servants
they're awful
they say anything they like and usually speak to members of the family as 'say'
no i believe i'd rather wait for september and a tandem mother  nevertheless george sometimes consented to sit in an automobile while waiting for september and he frequently went driving in one of eugene's cars with lucy and her father
he even allowed himself to be escorted with his mother and fanny through the growing factory which was now as the foreman of the paint shop informed the visitors turning out a car and a quarter a day george had seldom been more excessively bored but his mother showed a lively interest in everything wishing to have all the machinery explained to her
it was lucy who did most of the explaining while her father looked on and laughed at the mistakes she made and fanny remained in the background with george exhibiting a bleakness that overmatched his boredom
from the factory eugene took them to lunch at a new restaurant just opened in the town a place which surprised isabel with its metropolitan air and though george made fun of it to her in a whisper she offered everything the tribute of pleased exclamations and her gayety helped eugene's to make the little occasion almost a festive one
george's ennui disappeared in spite of himself and he laughed to see his mother in such spirits
i didn't know mineral waters could go to a person's head he said
or perhaps it's this place
it might pay to have a new restaurant opened somewhere in town every time you get the blues  fanny turned to him with a wan smile
oh she doesn't 'get the blues' george then she added as if fearing her remark might be thought unpleasantly significant i never knew a person of a more even disposition
i wish i could be like that and though the tone of this afterthought was not so enthusiastic as she tried to make it she succeeded in producing a fairly amiable effect
no isabel said reverting to george's remark and overlooking fanny's
what makes me laugh so much at nothing is eugene's factory
wouldn't anybody be delighted to see an old friend take an idea out of the air like thatan idea that most people laughed at him forwouldn't any old friend of his be happy to see how he'd made his idea into such a splendid humming thing as that factoryall shiny steel clicking and buzzing away and with all those workmen such muscled looking men and yet so intelligent looking  hear
hear george applauded
we seem to have a lady orator among us
i hope the waiters won't mind  isabel laughed not discouraged
it's beautiful to see such a thing  she said
it makes us all happy dear old eugene  and with a brave gesture she stretched out her hand to him across the small table
he took it quickly giving her a look in which his laughter tried to remain but vanished before a gratitude threatening to become emotional in spite of him
isabel however turned instantly to fanny
give him your hand fanny she said gayly and as fanny mechanically obeyed there isabel cried
if brother george were here eugene would have his three oldest and best friends congratulating him all at once
we know what brother george thinks about it though
it's just beautiful eugene  probably if her brother george had been with them at the little table he would have made known what he thought about herself for it must inevitably have struck him that she was in the midst of one of those times when she looked exactly fourteen years old lucy served as a proxy for amberson perhaps when she leaned toward george and whispered did you ever see anything so lovely  as what george inquired not because he misunderstood but because he wished to prolong the pleasant neighbourliness of whispering
as your mother
think of her doing that
she's a darling
and papahere she imperfectly repressed a tendency to laughpapa looks as if he were either going to explode or utter loud sobs  eugene commanded his features however and they resumed their customary apprehensiveness
i used to write verse he saidif you remember  yes isabel interrupted gently
i remember  i don't recall that i've written any for twenty years or so he continued
but i'm almost thinking i could do it again to thank you for making a factory visit into such a kind celebration  gracious lucy whispered giggling
aren't they sentimental  people that age always are george returned
they get sentimental over anything at all
factories or restaurants it doesn't matter what  and both of them were seized with fits of laughter which they managed to cover under the general movement of departure as isabel had risen to go
outside upon the crowded street george helped lucy into his runabout and drove off waving triumphantly and laughing at eugene who was struggling with the engine of his car in the tonneau of which isabel and fanny had established themselves
looks like a handorgan man grinding away for pennies said george as the runabout turned the corner and into national avenue
i'll still take a horse any day  he was not so cocksure half an hour later on an open road when a siren whistle wailed behind him and before the sound had died away eugene's car coming from behind with what seemed fairly like one long leap went by the runabout and dwindled almost instantaneously in perspective with a lace handkerchief in a blackgloved hand fluttering sweet derision as it was swept onward into minutenessa mere white speckand then out of sight
george was undoubtedly impressed
your father does know how to drive some the dashing exhibition forced him to admit
of course pendennis isn't as young as he was and i don't care to push him too hard
i wouldn't mind handling one of those machines on the road like that myself if that was all there was to itno cranking to do or fooling with the engine
well i enjoyed part of that lunch quite a lot lucy  the salad  no
your whispering to me  blarney  george made no response but checked pendennis to a walk
whereupon lucy protested quickly oh don't  why
do you want him to trot his legs off  no but  no but'what  she spoke with apparent gravity i know when you make him walk it's so you can give all your attention toto proposing to me again  and as she turned a face of exaggerated color to him by the lord but you're a little witch george cried
george do let pendennis trot again  i won't  she clucked to the horse
get up pendennis
trot
go on
commence  pendennis paid no attention she meant nothing to him and george laughed at her fondly
you are the prettiest thing in this world lucy he exclaimed
when i see you in winter in furs with your cheeks red i think you're prettiest then but when i see you in summer in a straw hat and a shirtwaist and a duck skirt and white gloves and those little silver buckled slippers and your rosecoloured parasol and your cheeks not red but with a kind of pinky glow about them then i see i must have been wrong about the winter
when are you going to drop the 'almost' and say we're really engaged  oh not for years
so there's the answer and let's trot again  but george was persistent moreover he had become serious during the last minute or two
i want to know he said
i really mean it  let's don't be serious george she begged him hopefully
let's talk of something pleasant  he was a little offended
then it isn't pleasant for you to know that i want to marry you  at this she became as serious as he could have asked she looked down and her lip quivered like that of a child about to cry
suddenly she put her hand upon one of his for just an instant and then withdrew it
lucy he said huskily
dear what's the matter
you look as if you were going to cry
you always do that he went on plaintively whenever i can get you to talk about marrying me  i know it she murmured
well why do you  her eyelids flickered and then she looked up at him with a sad gravity tears seeming just at the poise
one reason's because i have a feeling that it's never going to be  why  it's just a feeling  you haven't any reason or  it's just a feeling  well if that's all george said reassured and laughing confidently i guess i won't be very much troubled but at once he became serious again adopting the tone of argument
lucy how is anything ever going to get a chance to come of it so long as you keep sticking to 'almost'
doesn't it strike you as unreasonable to have a 'feeling' that we'll never be married when what principally stands between us is the fact that you won't be really engaged to me
that does seem pretty absurd
don't you care enough about me to marry me  she looked down again pathetically troubled
yes  won't you always care that much about me  i'myesi'm afraid so george
i never do change much about anything  well then why in the world won't you drop the 'almost'  her distress increased
everything iseverything  what about 'everything'  everything is soso unsettled  and at that he uttered an exclamation of impatience
if you aren't the queerest girl
what is 'unsettled'  well for one thing she said able to smile at his vehemence you haven't settled on anything to do
at least if you have you've never spoken of it  as she spoke she gave him the quickest possible side glance of hopeful scrutiny then looked away not happily
surprise and displeasure were intentionally visible upon the countenance of her companion and he permitted a significant period of silence to elapse before making any response
lucy he said finally with cold dignity i should like to ask you a few questions  yes  the first is haven't you perfectly well understood that i don't mean to go into business or adopt a profession  i wasn't quite sure she said gently
i really didn't knowquite  then of course it's time i did tell you
i never have been able to see any occasion for a man's going into trade or being a lawyer or any of those things if his position and family were such that he didn't need to
you know yourself there are a lot of people in the eastin the south too for that matterthat don't think we've got any particular family or position or culture in this part of the country
i've met plenty of that kind of provincial snobs myself and they're pretty galling
there were one or two men in my crowd at college their families had lived on their income for three generations and they never dreamed there was anybody in their class out here
i had to show them a thing or two right at the start and i guess they won't forget it
well i think it's time all their sort found out that three generations can mean just as much out here as anywhere else
that's the way i feel about it and let me tell you i feel it pretty deeply  but what are you going to do george she cried
george's earnestness surpassed hers he had become flushed and his breathing was emotional
as he confessed with simple genuineness he did feel what he was saying pretty deeply and in truth his state approached the tremulous
i expect to live an honourable life he said
i expect to contribute my share to charities and to take part inin movements  what kind  whatever appeals to me he said
lucy looked at him with grieved wonder
but you really don't mean to have any regular business or profession at all  i certainly do not george returned promptly and emphatically
i was afraid so she said in a low voice
george continued to breathe deeply throughout another protracted interval of silence
then he said i should like to revert to the questions i was asking you if you don't mind  no george
i think we'd better  your father is a business man  he's a mechanical genius lucy interrupted quickly
of course he's both
and he was a lawyer oncehe's done all sorts of things  very well
i merely wished to ask if it's his influence that makes you think i ought to 'do' something  lucy frowned slightly
why i suppose almost everything i think or say must be owing to his influence in one way or another
we haven't had anybody but each other for so many years and we always think about alike so of course  i see and george's brow darkened with resentment
so that's it is it
it's your father's idea that i ought to go into business and that you oughtn't to be engaged to me until i do  lucy gave a start her denial was so quick
no
i've never once spoken to him about it
never  george looked at her keenly and he jumped to a conclusion not far from the truth
but you know without talking to him that it's the way he does feel about it
i see  she nodded gravely
yes  george's brow grew darker still
do you think i'd be much of a man he said slowly if i let any other man dictate to me my own way of life  george
who's 'dictating' your  it seems to me it amounts to that he returned
oh no
i only know how papa thinks about things
he's never never spoken unkindly or 'dictatingly' of you she lifted her hand in protest and her face was so touching in its distress that for the moment george forgot his anger
he seized that small troubled hand
lucy he said huskily
don't you know that i love you  yesi do  don't you love me  yesi do  then what does it matter what your father thinks about my doing something or not doing anything
he has his way and i have mine
i don't believe in the whole world scrubbing dishes and selling potatoes and trying law cases
why look at your father's best friend my uncle george ambersonhe's never done anything in his life and  oh yes he has she interrupted
he was in politics  well i'm glad he's out george said
politics is a dirty business for a gentleman and uncle george would tell you that himself
lucy let's not talk any more about it
let me tell mother when i get home that we're engaged
won't you dear  she shook her head
is it because  for a fleeting instant she touched to her cheek the hand that held hers
no she said and gave him a sudden little look of renewed gayety
let's let it stay 'almost'  because your father  oh because it's better  george's voice shook
isn't it your father  it's his ideals i'm thinking ofyes  george dropped her hand abruptly and anger narrowed his eyes
i know what you mean he said
i dare say i don't care for your father's ideals any more than he does for mine  he tightened the reins pendennis quickening eagerly to the trot and when george jumped out of the runabout before lucy's gate and assisted her to descend the silence in which they parted was the same that had begun when pendennis began to trot
chapter xviii    that evening after dinner george sat with his mother and his aunt fanny upon the veranda
in former summers when they sat outdoors in the evening they had customarily used an open terrace at the side of the house looking toward the major's but that more private retreat now afforded too blank and abrupt a view of the nearest of the new houses so without consultation they had abandoned it for the romanesque stone structure in front an oppressive place
its oppression seemed congenial to george he sat upon the copestone of the stone parapet his back against a stone pilaster his attitude not comfortable but rigid and his silence not comfortable either but heavy
however to the eyes of his mother and his aunt who occupied wicker chairs at a little distance he was almost indistinguishable except for the stiff white shield of his evening frontage
it's so nice of you always to dress in the evening georgie his mother said her glance resting upon this surface
your uncle george always used to and so did father for years but they both stopped quite a long time ago
unless there's some special occasion it seems to me we don't see it done any more except on the stage and in the magazines  he made no response and isabel after waiting a little while as if she expected one appeared to acquiesce in his mood for silence and turned her head to gaze thoughtfully out at the street
there in the highway the evening life of the midland city had begun
a rising moon was bright upon the tops of the shade trees where their branches met overhead arching across the street but only filtered splashings of moonlight reached the block pavement below and through this darkness flashed the firefly lights of silent bicycles gliding by in pairs and triosor sometimes a dozen at a time might come and not so silent striking their little bells the riders' voices calling and laughing while now and then a pair of invisible experts would pass playing mandolin and guitar as if handlebars were of no account in the worldtheir music would come swiftly and then too swiftly die away
surreys rumbled lightly by with the plodplod of honest old horses and frequently there was the glitter of whizzing spokes from a runabout or a sporting buggy and the sharp decisive hoofbeats of a trotter
then like a cowboy shooting up a peaceful camp a frantic devil would hurtle out of the distance bellowing exhaust racketing like a machine gun gone amuckand at these horrid sounds the surreys and buggies would hug the curbstone and the bicycles scatter to cover cursing while children rushed from the sidewalks to drag pet dogs from the street
the thing would roar by leaving a long wake of turbulence then the indignant street would quiet down for a few minutestill another came
there are a great many more than there used to be miss fanny observed in her lifeless voice as the lull fell after one of these visitations
eugene is right about that there seem to be at least three or four times as many as there were last summer and you never hear the ragamuffins shouting 'get a horse'
nowadays but i think he may be mistaken about their going on increasing after this
i don't believe we'll see so many next summer as we do now  why asked isabel
because i've begun to agree with george about their being more a fad than anything else and i think it must be the height of the fad just now
you know how rollerskating came ineverybody in the world seemed to be crowding to the rinksand now only a few children use rollers for getting to school
besides people won't permit the automobiles to be used
really i think they'll make laws against them
you see how they spoil the bicycling and the driving people just seem to hate them
they'll never stand itnever in the world
of course i'd be sorry to see such a thing happen to eugene but i shouldn't be really surprised to see a law passed forbidding the sale of automobiles just the way there is with concealed weapons  fanny exclaimed her sisterinlaw
you're not in earnest  i am though  isabel's sweettoned laugh came out of the dusk where she sat
then you didn't mean it when you told eugene you'd enjoyed the drive this afternoon  i didn't say it so very enthusiastically did i  perhaps not but he certainly thought he'd pleased you  i don't think i gave him any right to think he'd pleased me fanny said slowly
why not
why shouldn't you fanny  fanny did not reply at once and when she did her voice was almost inaudible but much more reproachful than plaintive
i hardly think i'd want any one to get the notion he'd pleased me just now
it hardly seems time yetto me  isabel made no response and for a time the only sound upon the dark veranda was the creaking of the wicker rockingchair in which fanny sata creaking which seemed to denote content and placidity on the part of the chair's occupant though at this juncture a series of human shrieks could have been little more eloquent of emotional disturbance
however the creaking gave its hearer one great advantage it could be ignored
have you given up smoking george isabel asked presently
no  i hoped perhaps you had because you've not smoked since dinner
we shan't mind if you care to  no thanks  there was silence again except for the creaking of the rockingchair then a low clear whistle singularly musical was heard softly rendering an old air from fra diavolo the creaking stopped
is that you george fanny asked abruptly
is that me what  whistling 'on yonder rock reclining'  it's i said isabel
oh fanny said dryly
does it disturb you  not at all
i had an idea george was depressed about something and merely wondered if he could be making such a cheerful sound and fanny resumed her creaking
is she right george his mother asked quickly leaning forward in her chair to peer at him through the dusk
you didn't eat a very hearty dinner but i thought it was probably because of the warm weather
are you troubled about anything  no he said angrily
that's good
i thought we had such a nice day didn't you  i suppose so he muttered and satisfied she leaned back in her chair but fra diavolo was not revived
after a time she rose went to the steps and stood for several minutes looking across the street
then her laughter was faintly heard
are you laughing about something fanny inquired
pardon isabel did not turn but continued her observation of what had interested her upon the opposite side of the street
i asked were you laughing at something  yes i was and she laughed again
it's that funny fat old mrs johnson
she has a habit of sitting at her bedroom window with a pair of operaglasses  really  really
you can see the window through the place that was left when we had the dead walnut tree cut down
she looks up and down the street but mostly at father's and over here
sometimes she forgets to put out the light in her room and there she is spying away for all the world to see  however fanny made no effort to observe this spectacle but continued her creaking
i've always thought her a very good woman she said primly
so she is isabel agreed
she's a good friendly old thing a little too intimate in her manner sometimes and if her poor old operaglasses afford her the quiet happiness of knowing what sort of young man our new cook is walking out with i'm the last to begrudge it to her
don't you want to come and look at her george  what
i beg your pardon
i hadn't noticed what you were talking about  it's nothing she laughed
only a funny old ladyand she's gone now
i'm going tooat least i'm going indoors to read
it's cooler in the house but the heat's really not bad anywhere since nightfall
summer's dying
how quickly it goes once it begins to die  when she had gone into the house fanny stopped rocking and leaning forward drew her black gauze wrap about her shoulders and shivered
isn't it queer she said drearily how your mother can use such words  what words are you talking about george asked
words like 'die' and 'dying'
i don't see how she can bear to use them so soon after your poor father she shivered again
it's almost a year george said absently and he added it seems to me you're using them yourself  i
never  yes you did  when  just this minute  oh said fanny
you mean when i repeated what she said
that's hardly the same thing george  he was not enough interested to argue the point
i don't think you'll convince anybody that mother's unfeeling he said indifferently
i'm not trying to convince anybody
i mean merely that in my opinionwell perhaps it may be just as wise for me to keep my opinions to myself  she paused expectantly but her possible anticipation that george would urge her to discard wisdom and reveal her opinion was not fulfilled
his back was toward her and he occupied himself with opinions of his own about other matters
fanny may have felt some disappointment as she rose to withdraw
however at the last moment she halted with her hand upon the latch of the screen door
there's one thing i hope she said
i hope at least she won't leave off her full mourning on the very anniversary of wilbur's death  the light door clanged behind her and the sound annoyed her nephew
he had no idea why she thus used inoffensive wood and wire to dramatize her departure from the veranda the impression remaining with him being that she was critical of his mother upon some point of funeral millinery
throughout the desultory conversation he had been profoundly concerned with his own disturbing affairs and now was preoccupied with a dialogue taking place in his mind between himself and miss lucy morgan
as he beheld the vision lucy had just thrown herself at his feet
george you must forgive me she cried
papa was utterly wrong
i have told him so and the truth is that i have come to rather dislike him as you do and as you always have in your heart of hearts
george i understand you thy people shall be my people and thy gods my gods
george won't you take me back  lucy are you sure you understand me and in the darkness george's bodily lips moved in unison with those which uttered the words in his imaginary rendering of this scene
an eavesdropper concealed behind the column could have heard the whispered word sure the emphasis put upon it in the vision was so poignant
you say you understand me but are you sure  weeping her head bowed almost to her waist the ethereal lucy made reply oh so sure
i will never listen to father's opinions again
i do not even care if i never see him again  then i pardon you he said gently
this softened mood lasted for several momentsuntil he realized that it had been brought about by processes strikingly lacking in substance
abruptly he swung his feet down from the copestone to the floor of the veranda
pardon nothing no meek lucy had thrown herself in remorse at his feet and now he pictured her as she probably really was at this moment sitting on the white steps of her own front porch in the moonlight with redheaded fred kinney and silly charlie johnson and four or five othersall of them laughing most likely and some idiot playing the guitar
george spoke aloud riffraff  and because of an impish but all too natural reaction of the mind he could see lucy with much greater distinctness in this vision than in his former pleasing one
for a moment she was miraculously real before him every line and colour of her
he saw the moonlight shimmering in the chiffon of her skirts brightest on her crossed knee and the tip of her slipper saw the blue curve of the characteristic shadow behind her as she leaned back against the white step saw the watery twinkling of sequins in the gauze wrap over her white shoulders as she moved and the faint symmetrical lights in her black hairand not one alluring exasperating twentiethofaninch of her laughing profile was spared him as she seemed to turn to the infernal kinney  riffraff and george began furiously to pace the stone floor
riffraff by this hard terma favourite with him since childhood's scornful hourhe meant to indicate not lucy but the young gentlemen who in his vision surrounded her
riffraff he said again aloud and again  riffraff  at that moment as it happened lucy was playing chess with her father and her heart though not remorseful was as heavy as george could have wished
but she did not let eugene see that she was troubled and he was pleased when he won three games of her
usually she beat him
chapter xix   george went driving the next afternoon alone and encountering lucy and her father on the road in one of morgan's cars lifted his hat but nowise relaxed his formal countenance as they passed
eugene waved a cordial hand quickly returned to the steeringwheel but lucy only nodded gravely and smiled no more than george did
nor did she accompany eugene to the major's for dinner the following sunday evening though both were bidden to attend that feast which was already reduced in numbers and gayety by the absence of george amberson
eugene explained to his host that lucy had gone away to visit a schoolfriend
the information delivered in the library just before old sam's appearance to announce dinner set miss minafer in quite a flutter
why george she said turning to her nephew
how does it happen you didn't tell us and with both hands opening as if to express her innocence of some conspiracy she exclaimed to the others he's never said one word to us about lucy's planning to go away  probably afraid to the major suggested
didn't know but he might break down and cry if he tried to speak of it he clapped his grandson on the shoulder inquiring jocularly that it georgie  georgie made no reply but he was red enough to justify the major's developing a chuckle into laughter though miss fanny observing her nephew keenly got an impression that this fiery blush was in truth more fiery than tender
she caught a glint in his eye less like confusion than resentment and saw a dilation of his nostrils which might have indicated not so much a sweet agitation as an inaudible snort
fanny had never been lacking in curiosity and since her brother's death this quality was more than ever alert
the fact that george had spent all the evenings of the past week at home had not been lost upon her nor had she failed to ascertain by diplomatic inquiries that since the day of the visit to eugene's shops george had gone driving alone
at the dinnertable she continued to observe him sidelong and toward the conclusion of the meal she was not startled by an episode which brought discomfort to the others
after the arrival of coffee the major was rallying eugene upon some rival automobile shops lately built in a suburb and already promising to flourish
i suppose they'll either drive you out of the business said the old gentleman or else the two of you'll drive all the rest of us off the streets  if we do we'll even things up by making the streets five or ten times as long as they are now eugene returned
how do you propose to do that  it isn't the distance from the center of a town that counts said eugene it's the time it takes to get there
this town's already spreading bicycles and trolleys have been doing their share but the automobile is going to carry city streets clear out to the county line  the major was skeptical
dream on fair son he said
it's lucky for us that you're only dreaming because if people go to moving that far real estate values in the old residence part of town are going to be stretched pretty thin  i'm afraid so eugene assented
unless you keep things so bright and clean that the old section will stay more attractive than the new ones  not very likely
how are things going to be kept 'bright and clean' with soft coal and our kind of city government  they aren't eugene replied quickly
there's no hope of it and already the boardinghouse is marching up national avenue
there are two in the next block below here and there are a dozen in the halfmile below that
my relatives the sharons have sold their house and are building in the countryat least they call it 'the country'
it will be city in two or three years  good gracious the major exclaimed affecting 'dismay
so your little shops are going to ruin all your old friends eugene  unless my old friends take warning in time or abolish smoke and get a new kind of city government
i should say the best chance is to take warning  well well the major laughed
you have enough faith in miracles eugenegranting that trolleys and bicycles and automobiles are miracles
so you think they're to change the face of the land do you  they're already doing it major and it can't be stopped
automobiles  at this point he was interrupted
george was the interrupter
he had said nothing since entering the dining room but now he spoke in a loud and peremptory voice using the tone of one in authority who checks idle prattle and settles a matter forever
automobiles are a useless nuisance he said
there fell a moment's silence
isabel gazed incredulously at george colour slowly heightening upon her cheeks and temples while fanny watched him with a quick eagerness her eyes alert and bright
but eugene seemed merely quizzical as if not taking this brusquerie to himself
the major was seriously disturbed
what did you say george he asked though george had spoken but too distinctly
i said all automobiles were a nuisance george answered repeating not only the words but the tone in which he had uttered them
and he added they'll never amount to anything but a nuisance
they had no business to be invented  the major frowned
of course you forget that mr morgan makes them and also did his share in inventing them
if you weren't so thoughtless he might think you rather offensive  that would be too bad said george coolly
i don't think i could survive it  again there was a silence while the major stared at his grandson aghast
but eugene began to laugh cheerfully
i'm not sure he's wrong about automobiles he said
with all their speed forward they may be a step backward in civilizationthat is in spiritual civilization
it may be that they will not add to the beauty of the world nor to the life of men's souls
i am not sure
but automobiles have come and they bring a greater change in our life than most of us suspect
they are here and almost all outward things are going to be different because of what they bring
they are going to alter war and they are going to alter peace
i think men's minds are going to be changed in subtle ways because of automobiles just how though i could hardly guess
but you can't have the immense outward changes that they will cause without some inward ones and it may be that george is right and that the spiritual alteration will be bad for us
perhaps ten or twenty years from now if we can see the inward change in men by that time i shouldn't be able to defend the gasoline engine but would have to agree with him that automobiles 'had no business to be invented
' he laughed goodnaturedly and looking at his watch apologized for having an engagement which made his departure necessary when he would so much prefer to linger
then he shook hands with the major and bade isabel george and fanny a cheerful goodnighta collective farewell cordially addressed to all three of them togetherand left them at the table
isabel turned wondering hurt eyes upon her son
george dear she said
what did you mean  just what i said he returned lighting one of the major's cigars and his manner was imperturbable enough to warrant the definition sometimes merited by imperturbability of stubbornness
isabel's hand pale and slender upon the tablecloth touched one of the fine silver candlesticks aimlessly the fingers were seen to tremble
oh he was hurt she murmured
i don't see why he should be george said
i didn't say anything about him
he didn't seem to me to be hurtseemed perfectly cheerful
what made you think he was hurt  i know him was all of her reply half whispered
the major stared hard at george from under his white eyebrows
you didn't mean 'him' you say george
i suppose if we had a clergyman as a guest here you'd expect him not to be offended and to understand that your remarks were neither personal nor untactful if you said the church was a nuisance and ought never to have been invented
by jove but you're a puzzle  in what way may i ask sir  we seem to have a new kind of young people these days the old gentleman returned shaking his head
it's a new style of courting a pretty girl certainly for a young fellow to go deliberately out of his way to try and make an enemy of her father by attacking his business
by jove
that's a new way to win a woman  george flushed angrily and seemed about to offer a retort but held his breath for a moment and then held his peace
it was isabel who responded to the major
oh no she said
eugene would never be anybody's enemyhe couldn'tand last of all georgie's
i'm afraid he was hurt but i don't fear his not having understood that george spoke without thinking of what he was sayingi mean without realizing its bearing on eugene  again george seemed upon the point of speech and again controlled the impulse
he thrust his hands in his pockets leaned back in his chair and smoked staring inflexibly at the ceiling
well well said his grandfather rising
it wasn't a very successful little dinner  thereupon he offered his arm to his daughter who took it fondly and they left the room isabel assuring him that all his little dinners were pleasant and that this one was no exception
george did not move and fanny following the other two came round the table and paused close beside his chair but george remained posed in his great imperturbability cigar between teeth eyes upon ceiling and paid no attention to her
fanny waited until the sound of isabel's and the major's voices became inaudible in the hall
then she said quickly and in a low voice so eager that it was unsteady  george you've struck just the treatment to adopt you're doing the right thing  she hurried out scurrying after the others with a faint rustling of her black skirts leaving george mystified but incurious
he did not understand why she should bestow her approbation upon him in the matter and cared so little whether she did or not that he spared himself even the trouble of being puzzled about it
in truth however he was neither so comfortable nor so imperturbable as he appeared
he felt some gratification he had done a little to put the man in his placethat man whose influence upon his daughter was precisely the same thing as a contemptuous criticism of george amberson minafer and of george amberson minafer's ideals of life lucy's going away without a word was intended he supposed as a bit of punishment
well he wasn't the sort of man that people were allowed to punish he could demonstrate that to themsince they started it
it appeared to him as almost a kind of insolence this abrupt departurenot even telephoning
probably she wondered how he would take it she even might have supposed he would show some betraying chagrin when he heard of it
he had no idea that this was just what he had shown and he was satisfied with his evening's performance
nevertheless he was not comfortable in his mind though he could not have explained his inward perturbations for he was convinced without any confirmation from his aunt fanny that he had done just the right thing     chapter xx    isabel came to george's door that night and when she had kissed him goodnight she remained in the open doorway with her hand upon his shoulder and her eyes thoughtfully lowered so that her wish to say something more than goodnight was evident
not less obvious was her perplexity about the manner of saying it and george divining her thought amiably made an opening for her
well old lady he said indulgently you needn't look so worried
i won't be tactless with morgan again
after this i'll just keep out of his way  isabel looked up searching his face with the fond puzzlement which her eyes sometimes showed when they rested upon him then she glanced down the hall toward fanny's room and after another moment of hesitation came quickly in and closed the door
dear she said i wish you'd tell me something why don't you like eugene  oh i like him well enough george returned with a short laugh as he sat down and began to unlace his shoes
i like him well enoughin his place  no dear she said hurriedly
i've had a feeling from the very first that you didn't really like himthat you really never liked him
sometimes you've seemed to be friendly with him and you'd laugh with him over something in a jolly companionable way and i'd think i was wrong and that you really did like him after all but tonight i'm sure my other feeling was the right one you don't like him
i can't understand it dear i don't see what can be the matter  nothing's the matter  this easy declaration naturally failed to carry great weight and isabel went on in her troubled voice it seems so queer especially when you feel as you do about his daughter  at this george stopped unlacing his shoes abruptly and sat up
how do i feel about his daughter he demanded
well it's seemedas ifas if isabel began timidly
it did seemat least you haven't looked at any other girl ever since they came here andand certainly you've seemed very much interested in her
certainly you've been very great friends  well what of that  it's only that i'm like your grandfather i can't see how you could be so much interested in a girl andand not feel very pleasantly toward her father  well i'll tell you something george said slowly and a frown of concentration could be seen upon his brow as from a profound effort at selfexamination
i haven't ever thought much on that particular point but i admit there may be a little something in what you say
the truth is i don't believe i've ever thought of the two together exactlyat least not until lately
i've always thought of lucy just as lucy and of morgan just as morgan
i've always thought of her as a person herself not as anybody's daughter
i don't see what's very extraordinary about that
you've probably got plenty of friends for instance that don't care much about your son  no indeed she protested quickly
and if i knew anybody who felt like that i wouldn't  never mind he interrupted
i'll try to explain a little more
if i have a friend i don't see that it's incumbent upon me to like that friend's relatives
if i didn't like them and pretended to i'd be a hypocrite
if that friend likes me and wants to stay my friend 'he'll have to stand my not liking his relatives or else he can quit
i decline to be a hypocrite about it that's all
now suppose i have certain ideas or ideals which i have chosen for the regulation of my own conduct in life
suppose some friend of mine has a relative with ideals directly the opposite of mine and my friend believes more in the relative's ideals than in mine do you think i ought to give up my own just to please a person who's taken up ideals that i really despise  no dear of course people can't give up their ideals but i don't see what this has to do with dear little lucy and  i didn't say it had anything to do with them he interrupted
i was merely putting a case to show how a person would be justified in being a friend of one member of a family and feeling anything but friendly toward another
i don't say though that i feel unfriendly to mr morgan
i don't say that i feel friendly to him and i don't say that i feel unfriendly but if you really think that i was rude to him tonight  just thoughtless dear
you didn't see that what you said tonight  well i'll not say anything of that sort again where he can hear it
there isn't that enough  this question delivered with large indulgence met with no response for isabel still searching his face with her troubled and perplexed gaze seemed not to have heard it
on that account george repeated it and rising went to her and patted her reassuringly upon the shoulder
there old lady you needn't fear my tactlessness will worry you again
i can't quite promise to like people i don't care about one way or another but you can be sure i'll be careful after this not to let them see it
it's all right and you'd better toddle along to bed because i want to undress  but george she said earnestly you would like him if you'd just let yourself
you say you don't dislike him
why don't you like him
i can't understand at all
what is it that you don't  there there he said
it's all right and you toddle along  but george dear  now now
i really do want to get into bed
goodnight old lady  goodnight dear
but  let's not talk of it any more he said
it's all right and nothing in the world to worry about
so goodnight old lady
i'll be polite enough to him never fearif we happen to be thrown together
so goodnight  but george dear  i'm going to bed old lady so goodnight'  thus the interview closed perforce
she kissed him again before going slowly to her own room her perplexity evidently not dispersed but the subject was not renewed between them the next day or subsequently
nor did fanny make any allusion to the cryptic approbation she had bestowed upon her nephew after the major's not very successful little dinner though she annoyed george by looking at him oftener and longer than he cared to be looked at by an aunt
he could not glance her way it seemed without finding her redrimmed eyes fixed upon him eagerly with an alert and hopeful calculation in them which he declared would send a nervous man into fits
for thus one day he broke out in protest  it would he repeated vehemently
given time it wouldstraight into fits
what do you find the matter with me
is my tie always slipping up behind
can't you look at something else
my lord
we'd better buy a cat for you to stare at aunt fanny
a cat could stand it maybe
what in the name of goodness do you expect to see  but fanny laughed goodnaturedly and was not offended
it's more as if i expected you to see something isn't it she said quietly still laughing
now what do you mean by that  never mind  all right i don't
but for heaven's sake stare at somebody else awhile
try it on the housemaid  well well fanny said indulgently and then chose to be more obscure in her meaning than ever for she adopted a tone of deep sympathy for her final remark as she left him i don't wonder you're nervous these days poor boy  and george indignantly supposed that she referred to the ordeal of lucy's continued absence
during this period he successfully avoided contact with lucy's father though eugene came frequently to the house and spent several evenings with isabel and fanny and sometimes persuaded them and the major to go for an afternoon's motoring
he did not however come again to the major's sunday evening dinner even when george amberson returned
sunday evening was the time he explained for going over the week's work with his factory managers
when lucy came home the autumn was far enough advanced to smell of burning leaves and for the annual editorials in the papers on the purple haze the golden branches the ruddy fruit and the pleasure of long tramps in the brown forest
george had not heard of her arrival and he met her on the afternoon following that event at the sharons' where he had gone in the secret hope that he might hear something about her
janie sharon had just begun to tell him that she heard lucy was expected home soon after having a perfectly gorgeous timeinformation which george received with no responsive enthusiasmwhen lucy came demurely in a proper little autumn figure in green and brown
her cheeks were flushed and her dark eyes were bright indeed evidences as george supposed of the excitement incidental to the perfectly gorgeous time just concluded though janie and mary sharon both thought they were the effect of lucy's having seen george's runabout in front of the house as she came in
george took on colour himself as he rose and nodded indifferently and the hot suffusion to which he became subject extended its area to include his neck and ears
nothing could have made him much more indignant than his consciousness of these symptoms of the icy indifference which it was his purpose not only to show but to feel
she kissed her cousins gave george her hand said how d'you do and took a chair beside janie with a composure which augmented george's indignation
how d'you do he said
i trust that ahi trusti do trust  he stopped for it seemed to him that the word trust sounded idiotic
then to cover his awkwardness he coughed and even to his own rosy ears his cough was ostentatiously a false one
whereupon seeking to be plausible he coughed again and instantly hated himself the sound he made was an atrocity
meanwhile lucy sat silent and the two sharon girls leaned forward staring at him with strained eyes their lips tightly compressed and both were but too easily diagnosed as subject to an agitation which threatened their selfcontrol
he began again
i eri hope you have had aa pleasant time
i eri hope you are well
i hope you are extremelyi hope extremelyextremely and again he stopped in the midst of his floundering not knowing how to progress beyond extremely and unable to understand why the infernal word kept getting into his mouth
i beg your pardon lucy said
george was never more furious he felt that he was making a spectacle of himself and no young gentleman in the world was more loath than george amberson minafer to look a figure of fun
and while he stood there undeniably such a figure with janie and mary sharon threatening to burst at any moment if laughter were longer denied them
lucy sat looking at him with her eyebrows delicately lifted in casual polite inquiry
her own complete composure was what most galled him
nothing of the slightest importance he managed to say
i was just leaving
good afternoon and with long strides he reached the door and hastened through the hall but before he closed the front door he heard from janie and mary sharon the outburst of wild irrepressible emotion which his performance had inspired
he drove home in a tumultuous mood and almost ran down two ladies who were engaged in absorbing conversation at a crossing
they were his aunt fanny and the stout mrs johnson a jerk of the reins at the last instant saved them by a few inches but their conversation was so interesting that they were unaware of their danger and did not notice the runabout nor how close it came to them
george was so furious with himself and with the girl whose unexpected coming into a room could make him look such a fool that it might have soothed him a little if he had actually run over the two absorbed ladies without injuring them beyond repair
at least he said to himself that he wished he had it might have taken his mind off of himself for a few minutes
for in truth to be ridiculous and know it was one of several things that george was unable to endure
he was savage
he drove into the major's stable too fast the sagacious pendennis saving himself from going through a partition by a swerve which splintered a shaft of the runabout and almost threw the driver to the floor
george swore and then swore again at the fat old darkey tom for giggling at his swearing
hoopee said old tom
mus' been some white lady use mist' jawge mighty bad
white lady say 'no suh i ain' go'n out ridin' 'ith mist' jawge no mo''
mist' jawge drive in
'dam de dam worl'
dam de dam hoss
dam de dam nigga'
dam de dam dam'
hoopee  that'll do george said sternly
yessuh  george strode from the stable crossed the major's back yard then passed behind the new houses on his way home
these structures were now approaching completion but still in a state of rawness hideous to georgethough for that matter they were never to be anything except hideous to him
behind them stray planks bricks refuse of plaster and lath shingles straw empty barrels strips of twisted tin and broken tiles were strewn everywhere over the dried and pitted gray mud where once the suave lawn had lain like a green lake around those stately islands the two amberson houses
and george's state of mind was not improved by his present view of this repulsive area nor by his sensations when he kicked an uptilted shingle only to discover that what uptilted it was a brickbat on the other side of it
after that the whole world seemed to be one solid conspiracy of malevolence
in this temper he emerged from behind the house nearest to his own and glancing toward the street saw his mother standing with eugene morgan upon the cement path that led to the front gate
she was bareheaded and eugene held his hat and stick in his hand evidently he had been calling upon her and she had come from the house with him continuing their conversation and delaying their parting
they had paused in their slow walk from the front door to the gate yet still stood side by side their shoulders almost touching as though neither isabel nor eugene quite realized that their feet had ceased to bear them forward and they were not looking at each other but at some indefinite point before them as people do who consider together thoughtfully and in harmony
the conversation was evidently serious his head was bent and isabel's lifted left hand rested against her cheek but all the significances of their thoughtful attitude denoted companionableness and a shared understanding
yet a stranger passing would not have thought them married somewhere about eugene not quite to be located there was a romantic gravity and isabel tall and graceful with high colour and absorbed eyes was visibly no wife walking down to the gate with her husband
george stared at them
a hot dislike struck him at the sight of eugene and a vague revulsion like a strange unpleasant taste in his mouth came over him as he looked at his mother her manner was eloquent of so much thought about her companion and of such reliance upon him
and the picture the two thus made was a vivid one indeed to george whose angry eyes for some reason fixed themselves most intently upon isabel's lifted hand upon the white ruffle at her wrist bordering the graceful black sleeve and upon the little indentations in her cheek where the tips of her fingers rested
she should not have worn white at her wrist or at the throat either george felt and then strangely his resentment concentrated upon those tiny indentations at the tips of her fingersactual changes however slight and fleeting in his mother's face made because of mr eugene morgan
for the moment it seemed to george that morgan might have claimed the ownership of a face that changed for him
it was as if he owned isabel
the two began to walk on toward the gate where they stopped again turning to face each other and isabel's glance passing eugene fell upon george
instantly she smiled and waved her hand to him while eugene turned and nodded but george standing as in some rigid trance and staring straight at them gave these signals of greeting no sign of recognition whatever
upon this isabel called to him waving her hand again
georgie she called laughing
wake up dear
georgie hello  george turned away as if he had neither seen nor heard and stalked into the house by the side door
chapter xxi   he went to his room threw off his coat waistcoat collar and tie letting them lie where they chanced to fall and then having violently enveloped himself in a black velvet dressinggown continued this action by lying down with a vehemence that brought a wheeze of protest from his bed
his repose was only a momentary semblance however for it lasted no longer than the time it took him to groan riffraff between his teeth
then he sat up swung his feet to the floor rose and began to pace up and down the large room
he had just been consciously rude to his mother for the first time in his life for with all his riding down of populace and riffraff he had never before been either deliberately or impulsively disregardful of her
when he had hurt her it had been accidental and his remorse for such an accident was always adequate compensationand moreto isabel
but now he had done a rough thing to her and he did not repent rather he was the more irritated with her
and when he heard her presently go by his door with a light step singing cheerfully to herself as she went to her room he perceived that she had mistaken his intention altogether or indeed had failed to perceive that he had any intention at all
evidently she had concluded that he refused to speak to her and morgan out of sheer absentmindedness supposing him so immersed in some preoccupation that he had not seen them or heard her calling to him
therefore there was nothing of which to repent even if he had been so minded and probably eugene himself was unaware that any disapproval had recently been expressed
george snorted
what sort of a dreamy loon did they take him to be
there came a delicate eager tapping at his door not done with a knuckle but with the tip of a fingernail which was instantly clarified to george's mind's eye as plainly as if he saw it the long and polished whitemooned pink shield on the end of his aunt fanny's right forefinger
but george was in no mood for human communications and even when things went well he had little pleasure in fanny's society
therefore it is not surprising that at the sound of her tapping instead of bidding her enter he immediately crossed the room with the intention of locking the door to keep her out
fanny was too eager and opening the door before he reached it came quickly in and closed it behind her
she was in a street dress and a black hat with a black umbrella in her blackgloved handfor fanny's heavy mourning at least was nowhere tempered with a glimpse of white though the anniversary of wilbur's death had passed
an infinitesimal perspiration gleamed upon her pale skin she breathed fast as if she had run up the stairs and excitement was sharp in her widened eyes
her look was that of a person who had just seen something extraordinary or heard thrilling news
now what on earth do you want her chilling nephew demanded
george she said hurriedly i saw what you did when you wouldn't speak to them
i was sitting with mrs johnson at her front window across the street and i saw it all  well what of it  you did right fanny said with a vehemence not the less spirited because she suppressed her voice almost to a whisper
you did exactly right
you're behaving splendidly about the whole thing and i want to tell you i know your father would thank you if he could see what you're doing  my lord george broke out at her
you make me dizzy
for heaven's sake quit the mysterious detective businessat least do quit it around me
go and try it on somebody else if you like but i don't want to hear it  she began to tremble regarding him with a fixed gaze
you don't care to hear then she said huskily that i approve of what you're doing  certainly not
since i haven't the faintest idea what you think i'm 'doing' naturally i don't care whether you approve of it or not
all i'd like if you please is to be alone
i'm not giving a tea here this afternoon if you'll permit me to mention it  fanny's gaze wavered she began to blink then suddenly she sank into a chair and wept silently but with a terrible desolation
oh for the lord's sake he moaned
what in the world is wrong with you  you're always picking on me she quavered wretchedly her voice indistinct with the wetness that bubbled into it from her tears
you doyou always pick on me
you've always done italwaysever since you were a little boy
whenever anything goes wrong with you you take it out on me
you do
you always  george flung to heaven a gesture of despair it seemed to him the last straw that fanny should have chosen this particular time to come and sob in his room over his mistreatment of her
oh my lord he whispered then with a great effort addressed her in a reasonable tone look here aunt fanny i don't see what you're making all this fuss about
of course i know i've teased you sometimes but  teased' me she wailed
teased' me
oh it does seem too hard sometimesthis mean old life of mine does seem too hard
i don't think i can stand it
honestly i don't think i can
i came in here just to show you i sympathized with youjust to say something pleasant to you and you treat me as if i wereoh no you wouldn't treat a servant the way you treat me
you wouldn't treat anybody in the world like this except old fanny
'old fanny' you say
'it's nobody but old fanny so i'll kick hernobody will resent it
i'll kick her all i want to'
you do
that's how you think of mei know it
and you're right i haven't got anything in the world since my brother diednobodynothingnothing  oh my lord george groaned
fanny spread out her small soaked handkerchief and shook it in the air to dry it a little crying as damply and as wretchedly during this operation' as beforea sight which gave george a curious shock to add to his other agitations it seemed so strange
i ought not to have come she went on because i might have known it would only give you an excuse to pick on me again
i'm sorry enough i came i can tell you
i didn't mean to speak of it again to you at all and i wouldn't have but i saw how you treated them and i guess i got excited about it and couldn't help following the impulsebut i'll know better next time i can tell you
i'll keep my mouth shut as i meant to and as i would have if i hadn't got excited and if i hadn't felt sorry for you
but what does it matter to anybody if i'm sorry for them
i'm only old fanny  oh good gracious
how can it matter to me who's sorry for me when i don't know what they're sorry about  you're so proud she quavered and so hard
i tell you i didn't mean to speak of it to you and i never never in the world would have told you about it nor have made the faintest reference to it if i hadn't seen that somebody else had told you or you'd found out for yourself some way
i  in despair of her intelligence and in some doubt of his own george struck the palms of his hands together
somebody else had told me what
i'd found what out for myself  how people are talking about your mother  except for the incidental teariness of her voice her tone was casual as though she mentioned a subject previously discussed and understood for fanny had no doubt that george had only pretended to be mystified because in his pride he would not in words admit that he knew what he knew
what did you say he asked incredulously
of course i understood what you were doing fanny went on drying her handkerchief again
it puzzled other people when you began to be rude to eugene because they couldn't see how you could treat him as you did when you were so interested in lucy
but i remembered how you came to me that other time when there was so much talk about isabel and i knew you'd give lucy up in a minute if it came to a question of your mother's reputation because you said then that  look here george interrupted in a shaking voice
look here i'd like he stopped unable to go on his agitation was so great
his chest heaved as from hard running and his complexion pallid at first had become mottled fiery splotches appearing at his temples and cheeks
what do you mean by telling metelling me there's talk aboutabout  he gulped and began again what do you mean by using such words as 'reputation'
what do you mean speaking of a 'question' of mymy mother's reputation  fanny looked up at him woefully over the handkerchief which she now applied to her reddened nose
god knows i'm sorry for you george she murmured
i wanted to say so but it's only old fanny so whatever she sayseven when it's sympathypick on her for it
hammer her she sobbed
hammer her
it's only poor old lonely fanny  you look here george said harshly
when i spoke to my uncle george after that rotten thing i heard aunt amelia say about my mother he said if there was any gossip it was about you
he said people might be laughing about the way you ran after morgan but that was all  fanny lifted her hands clenched them and struck them upon her knees
yes it's always fanny she sobbed
ridiculous old fannyalways always  you listen george said
after i'd talked to uncle george i saw you and you said i had a mean little mind for thinking there might be truth in what aunt amelia said about people talking
you denied it
and that wasn't the only time you'd attacked me before then because i intimated that morgan might be coming here too often
you made me believe that mother let him come entirely on your account and now you say  i think he did fanny interrupted desolately
i think he did come as much to see me as anythingfor a while it looked like it
anyhow he liked to dance with me
he danced with me as much as he danced with her and he acted as if he came on my account at least as much as he did on hers
he did act a good deal that wayand if wilbur hadn't died  you told me there wasn't any talk  i didn't think there was much then fanny protested
i didn't know how much there was  what  people don't come and tell such things to a person's family you know
you don't suppose anybody was going to say to george amberson that his sister was getting herself talked about do you
or that they were going to say much to me  you told me said george fiercely that mother never saw him except when she was chaperoning you  they weren't much alone together then fanny returned
hardly ever before wilbur died
but you don't suppose that stops people from talking do you
your father never went anywhere and people saw eugene with her everywhere she wentand though i was with them people just thoughtshe chokedthey just thought i didn't count
'only old fanny minafer' i suppose they'd say
besides everybody knew that he'd been engaged to her  what's that george cried
everybody knows it
don't you remember your grandfather speaking of it at the sunday dinner one night  he didn't say they were engaged or  well they were
everybody knows it and she broke it off on account of that serenade when eugene didn't know what he was doing
he drank when he was a young man and she wouldn't stand it but everybody in this town knows that isabel has never really cared for any other man in her life
poor wilbur
he was the only soul alive that didn't know it  nightmare had descended upon the unfortunate george he leaned back against the footboard of his bed gazing wildly at his aunt
i believe i'm going crazy he said
you mean when you told me there wasn't any talk you told me a falsehood  no fanny gasped
you did  i tell you i didn't know how much talk there was and it wouldn't have amounted to much if wilbur had lived and fanny completed this with a fatal admission i didn't want you to interfere  george overlooked the admission his mind was not now occupied with analysis
what do you mean he asked when you say that if father had lived the talk wouldn't have amounted to anything  things might have beenthey might have been different  you mean morgan might have married you  fanny gulped
no
because i don't know that i'd have accepted him she had ceased to weep and now she sat up stiffly
i certainly didn't care enough about him to marry him i wouldn't have let myself care that much until he showed that he wished to marry me
i'm not that sort of person the poor lady paid her vanity this piteous little tribute
what i mean is if wilbur hadn't died people wouldn't have had it proved before their very eyes that what they'd been talking about was true  you sayyou say that people believe george shuddered then forced himself to continue in a sick voice they believe my mother isis in love with that man  of course  and because he comes hereand they see her with him drivingand all thatthey think they were right when they said she was inin love with him beforebefore my father died  she looked at him gravely with her eyes now dry between their reddened lids
why george she said gently don't you know that's what they say
you must know that everybody in town thinks they're going to be married very soon  george uttered an incoherent cry and sections of him appeared to writhe
he was upon the verge of actual nausea
you know it fanny cried getting up
you don't think i'd have spoken of it to you unless i was sure you knew it her voice was wholly genuine as it had been throughout the wretched interview fanny's sincerity was unquestionable
george i wouldn't have told you if you didn't know
what other reason could you have for treating eugene as you did or for refusing to speak to them like that a while ago in the yard
somebody must have told you  who told you he said
what  who told you there was talk
where is this talk
where does it come from
who does it  why i suppose pretty much everybody she said
i know it must be pretty general  who said so  what  george stepped close to her
you say people don't speak to a person of gossip about that person's family
well how did you hear it then
how did you get hold of it
answer me  fanny looked thoughtful
well of course nobody not one's most intimate friends would speak to them about such things and then only in the kindest most considerate way  who's spoken of it to you in any way at all george demanded
why fanny hesitated
you answer me  i hardly think it would be fair to give names  look here said george
one of your most intimate friends is that mother of charlie johnson's for instance
has she ever mentioned this to you
you say everybody is talking
is she one  oh she may have intimated  i'm asking you has she ever spoken of it to you  she's a very kind discreet woman george but she may have intimated  george had a sudden intuition as there flickered into his mind the picture of a streetcrossing and two absorbed ladies almost run down by a fast horse
you and she have been talking about it today he cried
you were talking about it with her not two hours ago
do you deny it  i  do you deny it  no  all right said george
that's enough  she caught at his arm as he turned away
what are you going to do george  i'll not talk about it now he said heavily
i think you've done a good deal for one day aunt fanny  and fanny seeing the passion in his face began to be alarmed
she tried to retain possession of the black velvet sleeve which her fingers had clutched and he suffered her to do so but used this leverage to urge her to the door
george you know i'm sorry for you whether you care or not she whimpered
i never in the world would have spoken of it if i hadn't thought you knew all about it
i wouldn't have  but he had opened the door with his free hand
never mind he said and she was obliged to pass out into the hall the door closing quickly behind her
chapter xxii   george took off his dressinggown and put on a collar and a tie his fingers shaking so that the tie was not his usual success then he picked up his coat and waistcoat and left the room while still in process of donning them fastening the buttons as he ran down the front stairs to the door
it was not until he reached the middle of the street that he realized that he had forgotten his hat and he paused for an irresolute moment during which his eye wandered for no reason to the fountain of neptune
this castiron replica of too elaborate sculpture stood at the next corner where the major had placed it when the addition was laid out so long ago
the street corners had been shaped to conform with the great octagonal basin which was no great inconvenience for horsedrawn vehicles but a nuisance to speeding automobiles and even as george looked one of the latter coming too fast saved itself only by a dangerous skid as it rounded the fountain
this skid was to george's liking though he would have been more pleased to see the car go over for he was wishing grief and destruction just then upon all the automobiles in the world
his eyes rested a second or two longer upon the fountain of neptune not an enlivening sight even in the shielding haze of autumn twilight
for more than a year no water had run in the fountain the connections had been broken and the major was evasive about restorations even when reminded by his grandson that a dry fountain is as gay as a dry fish
soot streaks and a thousand pits gave neptune the distinction at least of leprosy which the mermaids associated with him had been consistent in catching and his trident had been so deeply affected as to drop its prongs
altogether this heavy work of heavy art smoked dry hugely scabbed cracked and crumbling was a dismal sight to the distracted eye of george amberson minafer and its present condition of craziness may have added a mite to his own
his own was sufficient with no additions however as he stood looking at the johnsons' house and those houses on both sides of itthat row of riffraff dwellings he had thought so damnable the day when he stood in his grandfather's yard staring at them after hearing what his aunt amelia said of the talk  about his mother
he decided that he needed no hat for the sort of call he intended to make and went forward hurriedly
mrs johnson was at home the irish girl who came to the door informed him and he was left to await the lady in a room like an elegant wellthe johnsons' reception room floor space nothing to mention walls blue calcimined ceiling twelve feet from the floor inside shutters and gray lace curtains five gilt chairs a brocaded sofa soiled and an inlaid walnut table supporting two tall alabaster vases a palm with two leaves dying in a corner
mrs johnson came in breathing noticeably and her round head smoothly but economically decorated with the hair of an honest woman seemed to be lingering far in the background of the alpine bosom which took precedence of the rest of her everywhere but when she was all in the room it was to be seen that her breathing was the result of hospitable haste to greet the visitor and her hand not so dry as neptune's fountain suggested that she had paused for only the briefest ablutions
george accepted this cold damp lump mechanically
mr
ambersoni mean mr minafer she exclaimed
i'm really delighted i understood you asked for me
mr johnson's out of the city but charlie's downtown and i'm looking for him at any minute now and he'll be so pleased that you  i didn't want to see charlie george said
i want  do sit down the hospitable lady urged him seating herself upon the sofa
do sit down  no i thank you
i wish  surely you're not going to run away again when you've just come
do sit down mr minafer
i hope you're all well at your house and at the dear old major's too
he's looking  mrs
johnson george said in a strained loud voice which arrested her attention immediately so that she was abruptly silent leaving her surprised mouth open
she had already been concealing some astonishment at this unexampled visit however and the condition of george's ordinarily smooth hair for he had overlooked more than his hat had not alleviated her perplexity
mrs
johnson he said i have come to ask you a few questions which i would like you to answer if you please  she became grave at once
certainly mr minafer
anything i can  he interrupted sternly yet his voice shook in spite of its sternness
you were talking with my aunt fanny about my mother this afternoon  at this mrs johnson uttered an involuntary gasp but she recovered herself
then i'm sure our conversation was a very pleasant one if we were talking of your mother because  again he interrupted
my aunt has told me what the conversation virtually was and i don't mean to waste any time mrs johnson
you were talking about a george's shoulders suddenly heaved uncontrollably but he went fiercely on you were discussing a scandal that involved my mother's name  mr
minafer  isn't that the truth  i don't feel called upon to answer mr minafer she said with visible agitation
i do not consider that you have any right  my aunt told me you repeated this scandal to her  i don't think your aunt can have said that mrs johnson returned sharply
i did not repeat a scandal of any kind to your aunt and i think you are mistaken in saying she told you i did
we may have discussed some matters that have been a topic of comment about town  yes george cried
i think you may have
that's what i'm here about and what i intend to  don't tell me what you intend please mrs johnson interrupted crisply
and i should prefer that you would not make your voice quite so loud in this house which i happen to own
your aunt may have told youthough i think it would have been very unwise in her if she did and not very considerate of meshe may have told you that we discussed some such topic as i have mentioned and possibly that would have been true
if i talked it over with her you may be sure i spoke in the most charitable spirit and without sharing in other people's disposition to put an evil interpretation on what may be nothing more than unfortunate appearances and  my god said george
i can't stand this  you have the option of dropping the subject mrs johnson suggested tartly and she added or of leaving the house  i'll do that soon enough but first i mean to know  i am perfectly willing to tell you anything you wish if you will remember to ask it quietly
i'll also take the liberty of reminding you that i had a perfect right to discuss the subject with your aunt
other people may be less considerate in not confining their discussion of it as i have to charitable views expressed only to a member of the family
other people  other people the unhappy george repeated viciously
that's what i want to know aboutthese other people  i beg your pardon  i want to ask you about them
you say you know of other people who talk about this  i presume they do  how many  what  i want to know how many other people talk about it  dear dear she protested
how should i know that  haven't you heard anybody mention it  i presume so  well how many have you heard  mrs johnson was becoming more annoyed than apprehensive and she showed it
really this isn't a courtroom she said
and i'm not a defendant in a libelsuit either  the unfortunate young man lost what remained of his balance
you may be he cried
i intend to know just who's dared to say these things if i have to force my way into every house in town and i'm going to make them take every word of it back
i mean to know the name of every slanderer that's spoken of this matter to you and of every tattler you've passed it on to yourself
i mean to know  you'll know something pretty quick she said rising with difficulty and her voice was thick with the sense of insult
you'll know that you're out in the street
please to leave my house  george stiffened sharply
then he bowed and strode out of the door
three minutes later disheveled and perspiring but cold all over he burst into his uncle george's room at the major's without knocking
amberson was dressing
good gracious georgie he exclaimed
what's up  i've just come from mrs johnson'sacross the street george panted
you have your own tastes was amberson's comment
but curious as they are you ought to do something better with your hair and button your waistcoat to the right buttonseven for mrs johnson
what were you doing over there  she told me to leave the house george said desperately
i went there because aunt fanny told me the whole town was talking about my mother and that man morganthat they say my mother is going to marry him and that proves she was too fond of him before my father diedshe said this mrs johnson was one that talked about it and i went to her to ask who were the others  amberson's jaw fell in dismay
don't tell me you did that he said in a low voice and then seeing that it was true oh now you have done it     chapter xxiii    i've 'done it' george cried
what do you mean i've done it
and what have i done  amberson had collapsed into an easy chair beside his dressingtable the white evening tie he had been about to put on dangling from his hand which had fallen limply on the arm of the chair
the tie dropped to the floor before he replied and the hand that had held it was lifted to stroke his graying hair reflectively
by jove he muttered
that is too bad  george folded his arms bitterly
will you kindly answer my question
what have i done that wasn't honourable and right
do you think these riffraff can go about bandying my mother's name  they can now said amberson
i don't know if they could before but they certainly can now  what do you mean by that  his uncle sighed profoundly picked up his tie and preoccupied with despondency twisted the strip of white lawn till it became unwearable
meanwhile he tried to enlighten his nephew
gossip is never fatal georgie he said until it is denied
gossip goes on about every human being alive and about all the dead that are alive enough to be remembered and yet almost never does any harm until some defender makes a controversy
gossip's a nasty thing but it's sickly and if people of good intentions will let it entirely alone it will die ninetynine times out of a hundred  see here george said i didn't come to listen to any generalizing dose of philosophy
i ask you  you asked me what you've done and i'm telling you amberson gave him a melancholy smile continuing suffer me to do it in my own way
fanny says there's been talk about your mother and that mrs johnson does some of it
i don't know because naturally nobody would come to me with such stuff or mention it before me but it's presumably truei suppose it is
i've seen fanny with mrs johnson quite a lot and that old lady is a notorious gossip and that's why she ordered you out of her house when you pinned her down that she'd been gossiping
i have a suspicion mrs johnson has been quite a comfort to fanny in their long talks but she'll probably quit speaking to her over this because fanny told you
i suppose it's true that the 'whole town' a lot of others that is do share in the gossip
in this town naturally anything about any amberson has always been a stone dropped into the centre of a pond and a lie would send the ripples as far as a truth would
i've been on a steamer when the story went all over the boat the second day out' that the prettiest girl on board didn't have any ears and you can take it as a rule that when a woman's past thirtyfive the prettier her hair is the more certain you are to meet somebody with reliable information that it's a wig
you can be sure that for many years there's been more gossip in this place about the ambersons than about any other family
i dare say it isn't so much so now as it used to be because the town got too big long ago but it's the truth that the more prominent you are the more gossip there is about you and the more people would like to pull you down
well they can't do it as long as you refuse to know what gossip there is about you
but the minute you notice it it's got you
i'm not speaking of certain kinds of slander that sometimes people have got to take to the courts i'm talking of the wretched buzzing the mrs johnsons dothe thing you seem to have such a horror ofpeople 'talking'the kind of thing that has assailed your mother
people who have repeated a slander either get ashamed or forget it if they're let alone
challenge them and in selfdefense they believe everything they've said they'd rather believe you a sinner than believe themselves liars naturally
submit to gossip and you kill it fight it and you make it strong
people will forget almost any slander except one that's been fought  is that all george asked
i suppose so his uncle murmured sadly
well then may i ask what you'd have done in my place  i'm not sure georgie
when i was your age i was like you in many ways especially in not being very coolheaded so i can't say
youth can't be trusted for much except asserting itself and fighting and making love  indeed george snorted
may i ask what you think i ought to have done  nothing  'nothing george echoed mocking bitterly i suppose you think i mean to let my mother's good name  your mother's good name amberson cut him off impatiently
nobody has a good name in a bad mouth
nobody has a good name in a silly mouth either
well your mother's name was in some silly mouths and all you've done was to go and have a scene with the worst old woman gossip in the towna scene that's going to make her into a partisan against your mother whereas she was a mere prattler before
don't you suppose she'll be all over town with this tomorrow
tomorrow
why she'll have her telephone going tonight as long as any of her friends are up
people that never heard anything about this are going to hear it all now with embellishments
and she'll see to it that everybody who's hinted anything about poor isabel will know that you're on the warpath and that will put them on the defensive and make them vicious
the story will grow as it spreads and  george unfolded his arms to strike his right fist into his left palm
but do you suppose i'm going to tolerate such things he shouted
what do you suppose i'll be doing  nothing helpful  oh you think so do you  you can do absolutely nothing said amberson
nothing of any use
the more you do the more harm you'll do  you'll see
i'm going to stop this thing if i have to force my way into every house on national avenue and amberson boulevard  his uncle laughed rather sourly but made no other comment
well what do you propose to do george demanded
do you propose to sit there  yes  and let this riffraff bandy my mother's good name back and forth among them
is that what you propose to do  it's all i can do amberson returned
it's all any of us can do now just sit still and hope that the thing may die down in time in spite of your stirring up that awful old woman  george drew a long breath then advanced and stood close before his uncle
didn't you understand me when i told you that people are saying my mother means to marry this man  yes i understood you  you say that my going over there has made matters worse george went on
how about it if such asuch an unspeakable marriage did take place
do you think that would make people believe they'd been wrong in sayingyou know what they say  no said amberson deliberately i don't believe it would
there'd be more badness in the bad mouths and more silliness in the silly mouths i dare say
but it wouldn't hurt isabel and eugene if they never heard of it and if they did hear of it then they could take their choice between placating gossip or living for their own happiness
if they have decided to marry  george almost staggered
good god he gasped
you speak of it calmly  amberson looked up at him inquiringly
why shouldn't they marry if they want to he asked
it's their own affair  why shouldn't they george echoed
why shouldn't they  yes
why shouldn't they
i don't see anything precisely monstrous about two people getting married when they're both free and care about each other
what's the matter with their marrying  it would be monstrous george shouted
monstrous even if this horrible thing hadn't happened but now in the face of thisoh that you can sit there and even speak of it
your own sister
o god
oh he became incoherent swinging away from amberson and making for the door wildly gesturing
for heaven's sake don't be so theatrical said his uncle and then seeing that george was leaving the room come back here
you mustn't speak to your mother of this  don't 'tend to george said indistinctly and he plunged out into the big dimly lit hall
he passed his grandfather's room on the way to the stairs and the major was visible within his white head brightly illumined by a lamp as he bent low over a ledger upon his rolltop desk
he did not look up and his grandson strode by the door not really conscious of the old figure stooping at its tremulous work with long additions and subtractions that refused to balance as they used to
george went home and got a hat and overcoat without seeing either his mother or fanny
then he left word that he would be out for dinner and hurried away from the house
he walked the dark streets of amberson addition for an hour then went downtown and got coffee at a restaurant
after that he walked through the lighted parts of the town until ten o'clock when he turned north and came back to the purlieus of the addition
he strode through the length and breadth of it again his hat pulled down over his forehead his overcoat collar turned up behind
he walked fiercely though his feet ached but by and by he turned homeward and when he reached the major's went in and sat upon the steps of the huge stone veranda in frontan obscure figure in that lonely and repellent place
all lights were out at the major's and finally after twelve he saw his mother's window darken at home
he waited half an hour longer then crossed the front yards of the new houses and let himself noiselessly in the front door
the light in the hall had been left burning and another in his own room as he discovered when he got there
he locked the door quickly and without noise but his fingers were still upon the key when there was a quick footfall in the hall outside
georgie dear  he went to the other end of the room before replying
yes  i'd been wondering where you were dear  had you  there was a pause then she said timidly wherever it was i hope you had a pleasant evening  after a silence thank you he said without expression
another silence followed before she spoke again
you wouldn't care to be kissed goodnight i suppose and with a little flurry of placative laughter she added at your age of course  i'm going to bed now he said
goodnight  another silence seemed blanker than those which had preceded it and finally her voice cameit was blank too
goodnight  after he was in bed his thoughts became more tumultuous than ever while among all the inchoate and fragmentary sketches of this dreadful day now rising before him the clearest was of his uncle collapsed in a big chair with a white tie dangling from his hand and one conviction following upon that picture became definite in george's mind that his uncle george amberson was a hopeless dreamer from whom no help need be expected an amiable imbecile lacking in normal impulses and wholly useless in a struggle which required honour to be defended by a man of action
then would return a vision of mrs johnson's furious round head set behind her great bosom like the sun far sunk on the horizon of a mountain plateauand her crackling asthmatic voice without sharing in other people's disposition to put an evil interpretation on what may be nothing more than unfortunate appearances other people may be less considerate in not confining their discussion of it as i have to charitable views you'll know something pretty quick
you'll know you're out in the street and then george would get up againand againand pace the floor in his bare feet
that was what the tormented young man was doing when daylight came gauntly in at his windowpacing the floor rubbing his head in his hands and muttering  it can't be true this can't be happening to me     chapter xxiv    breakfast was brought to him in his room as usual but he did not make his normal healthy raid upon the dainty tray the food remained untouched and he sustained himself upon coffeefour cups of it which left nothing of value inside the glistening little percolator
during this process he heard his mother being summoned to the telephone in the hall not far from his door and then her voice responding yes
oh it's you
indeed i should
of course  then i'll expect you about three
yes
goodbye till then a few minutes later he heard her speaking to someone beneath his window and looking out saw her directing the removal of plants from a small garden bed to the major's conservatory for the winter
there was an air of briskness about her as she turned away to go into the house she laughed gaily with the major's gardener over something he said and this unconcerned cheerfulness of her was terrible to her son
he went to his desk and searching the jumbled contents of a drawer brought forth a large unframed photograph of his father upon which he gazed long and piteously till at last hot tears stood in his eyes
it was strange how the inconsequent face of wilbur seemed to increase in high significance during this belated interview between father and son and how it seemed to take on a reproachful nobilityand yet under the circumstances nothing could have been more natural than that george having paid but the slightest attention to his father in life should begin to deify him now that he was dead
poor poor father the son whispered brokenly
poor man i'm glad you didn't know  he wrapped the picture in a sheet of newspaper put it under his arm and leaving the house hurriedly and stealthily went downtown to the shop of a silversmith where he spent sixty dollars on a resplendently festooned silver frame for the picture
having lunched upon more coffee he returned to the house at two o'clock carrying the framed photograph with him and placed it upon the centretable in the library the room most used by isabel and fanny and himself
then he went to a front window of the long reception room and sat looking out through the lace curtains
the house was quiet though once or twice he heard his mother and fanny moving about upstairs and a ripple of song in the voice of isabela fragment from the romantic ballad of lord bateman
lord bateman was a noble lord a noble lord of high degree and he sailed west and he sailed east far countries for to see  the words became indistinct the air was hummed absently the humming shifted to a whistle then drifted out of hearing and the place was still again
george looked often at his watch but his vigil did not last an hour
at ten minutes of three peering through the curtain he saw an automobile stop in front of the house and eugene morgan jump lightly down from it
the car was of a new pattern low and long with an ample seat in the tonneau facing forward and a professional driver sat at the wheel a strange figure in leather goggled out of all personality and seemingly part of the mechanism
eugene himself as he came up the cement path to the house was a figure of the new era which was in time to be so disastrous to stiff hats and skirted coats and his appearance afforded a debonair contrast to that of the queerlooking duck capering at the amberson ball in an old dress coat and chugging up national avenue through the snow in his nightmare of a sewingmachine
eugene this afternoon was richly in the new outdoor mode motoring coat was soft gray fur his cap and gloves were of gray suede and though lucy's hand may have shown itself in the selection of these garnitures he wore them easily even with becoming hint of jauntiness
some change might be his face too for a successful man is seldom to be mistaken especially if his temper be genial
eugene had begun to look like a millionaire
but above everything else what was most evident about him as he came up the path was confidence in the happiness promised by his errand the anticipation in his eyes could have been read by a stranger
his look at the door of isabel's house was the look of a man who is quite certain that the next moment will reveal something ineffably charming inexpressibly dear
when the bell rang george waited at the entrance of the reception room until a housemaid came through the hall on her way to answer the summons
you needn't mind mary he told her
i'll see who it is and what they want
probably it's only a pedlar  thank you sir mister george said mary and returned to the rear of the house
george went slowly to the front door and halted regarding the misty silhouette of the caller upon the ornamental frosted glass
after a minute of waiting this silhouette changed outline so that an arm could be distinguishedan arm outstretched toward the bell as if the gentleman outside doubted whether or not it had sounded and were minded to try again
but before the gesture was completed george abruptly threw open the door and stepped squarely upon the middle of the threshold
a slight change shadowed the face of eugene his look of happy anticipation gave way to something formal and polite
how do you do george he said
mrs
minafer expects to go driving with me i believeif you'll be so kind as to send her word that i'm here  george made not the slightest movement
no he said
eugene was incredulous even when his second glance revealed how hot of eye was the haggard young man before him
i beg your pardon
i said  i heard you said george
you said you had an engagement with my mother and i told you no  eugene gave him a steady look and then he quietly what is thethe difficulty  george kept his own voice quiet enough but that did not mitigate the vibrant fury of it
mymother will have no interest in knowing that you came here today he said
or any other day  eugene continued to look at him with a scrutiny in which began to gleam a profound anger none less powerful because it was so quiet
i am afraid i do not understand you  i doubt if i could make it much plainer george said raising his voice slightly but i'll try
you're not wanted in this house mr morgan now or at any other time
perhaps you'll understandthis  and with the last word he closed the door in eugene's face
then not moving away he stood just inside door and noted that the misty silhouette remained upon the frosted glass for several moments as if the forbidden gentleman debated in his mind what course to pursue
let him ring again george thought grimly
or try the side dooror the kitchen  but eugene made no further attempt the silhouette disappeared footsteps could be heard withdrawing across the floor of the veranda and george returning to the window in the reception room was rewarded by the sight of an automobile manufacturer in baffled retreat with all his wooing furs and fineries mocking him
eugene got into his car slowly not looking back at the house which had just taught him such a lesson and it was easily visibleeven from a window seventy feet distantthat he was not the same light suitor who had jumped so gallantly from the car only a few minutes earlier
observing the heaviness of his movements as he climbed into the tonneau george indulged in a sickish throat rumble which bore a distant cousinship to mirth
the car was quicker than its owner it shot away as soon as he had sunk into his seat and george having watched its impetuous disappearance from his field of vision ceased to haunt the window
he went to the library and seating himself beside the table whereon he had placed the photograph of his father picked up a book and pretended to be engaged in reading it
presently isabel's buoyant step was heard descending the stairs and her low sweet whistling renewing the air of lord bateman she came into the library still whistling thoughtfully a fur coat over her arm ready to put on and two veils round her small black hat her right hand engaged in buttoning the glove upon her left and as the large room contained too many pieces of heavy furniture and the inside shutters excluded most of the light of day she did not at once perceive george's presence
instead she went to the bay window at the end of the room which afforded a view of the street and glanced out expectantly then bent her attention upon her glove after that looked out toward the street again ceased to whistle and turned toward the interior of the room
why georgie  she came leaned over from behind him and there was a faint exquisite odour as from distant apple blossoms as she kissed his cheek
dear i waited lunch almost an hour for you but you didn't come
did you lunch out somewhere  yes he did not look up from the book
did you have plenty to eat  yes  are you sure
wouldn't you like to have maggie get you something now in the dining room
or they could bring it to you here if you think it would be cozier
shan't i  a tinkling bell was audible and she moved to the doorway into the hall
i'm going out driving dear
i she interrupted herself to address the housemaid who was passing through the hall i think it's mr morgan mary
tell him i'll be there at once  yes ma'am  mary returned
twas a pedlar ma'am  another one isabel said surprised
i thought you said it was a pedlar when the bell rang a little while ago  mister george said it was ma'am he went to the door mary informed her disappearing
there seem to be a great many of them isabel mused
what did yours want to sell george  he didn't say  you must have cut him off short she laughed and then still standing in the doorway she noticed the big silver frame upon the table beside him
gracious georgie she exclaimed
you have been investing and as she came across the room for a closer view is itis it lucy  she asked half timidly half archly
but the next instant she saw whose likeness was thus set forth in elegiac splendourand she was silent except for a long justaudible oh  he neither looked up nor moved
that was nice of you georgie she said in a low voice presently
i ought to have had it framed myself when i gave it to you  he said nothing and standing beside him she put her hand gently upon his shoulder then as gently withdrew it and went out of the room
but she did not go upstairs he heard the faint rustle of her dress in the hall and then the sound of her footsteps in the reception room after a time silence succeeded even these slight tokens of her presence whereupon george rose and went warily into the hall taking care to make no noise and he obtained an oblique view of her through the open double doors of the reception room she was sitting in the chair which he had occupied so long and she was looking out of the window expectantlya little troubled
he went back to the library waited an interminable half hour then returned noiselessly to the same position in the hall where he could see her
she was still sitting patiently by the window
waiting for that man was she
well it might be quite a long wait
and the grim george silently ascended the stairs to his own room and began to pace his suffering floor
chapter xxv    he left his door open however and when he heard the front doorbell ring by and by he went half way down the stairs and stood to listen
he was not much afraid that morgan would return but he wished to make sure
mary appeared in the hall below him but after a glance toward the front of the house turned back and withdrew
evidently isabel had gone to the door
then a murmur was heard and george amberson's voice quick and serious i want to talk to you isabel and another murmur then isabel and her brother passed the foot of the broad dark stairway but did not look up and remained unconscious of the watchful presence above them
isabel still carried her cloak upon her arm but amberson had taken her hand and retained it and as he led her silently into the library there was something about her attitude and the pose of her slightly bent head that was both startled and meek
thus they quickly disappeared from george's sight hand in hand and amberson at once closed the massive double doors of the library
for a time all that george could hear was the indistinct sound of his uncle's voice what he was saying could not be surmised though the troubled brotherliness of his tone was evident
he seemed to be explaining something at considerable length and there were moments when he paused and george guessed that his mother was speaking but her voice must have been very low for it was entirely inaudible to him
suddenly he did hear her
through the heavy doors her outcry came clear and loud  oh no  it was a cry of protest as if something her brother told her must be untrue or if it were true the fact he stated must be undone and it was a sound of sheer pain
another sound of pain close to george followed it this was a vehement sniffling which broke out just above him and looking up he saw fanny minafer on the landing leaning over the banisters and applying her handkerchief to her eyes and nose
i can guess what that was about she whispered huskily
he's just told her what you did to eugene  george gave her a dark look over his shoulder
you go on back to your room he said and he began to descend the stairs but fanny guessing his purpose rushed down and caught his arm detaining him
you're not going in there she whispered huskily
you don't  let go of me  but she clung to him savagely
no you don't georgie minafer
you'll keep away from there
you will  you let go of  i won't
you come back here
you'll come upstairs and let them alone that's what you'll do and with such passionate determination did she clutch and tug never losing a grip of him somewhere though george tried as much as he could without hurting her to wrench awaywith such utter forgetfulness of her maiden dignity did she assault him that she forced him stumbling upward to the landing
of all the ridiculous he began furiously but she spared one hand from its grasp of his sleeve and clapped it over his mouth
hush up never for an instant in this grotesque struggle did fanny raise her voice above a husky whisper
hush up
it's indecentlike squabbling outside the door of an operatingroom
go on to the top of the stairsgo on  and when george had most unwillingly obeyed she planted herself in his way on the top step
there she said
the idea of your going in there now
i never heard of such a thing and with the sudden departure of the nervous vigour she had shown so amazingly she began to cry again
i was an awful fool
i thought you knew what was going on or i never never would have done it
do you suppose i dreamed you'd go making everything into such a tragedy
do you  i don't care what you dreamed george muttered
but fanny went on always taking care to keep her voice from getting too loud in spite of her most grievous agitation
do you dream i thought you'd go making such a fool of yourself at mrs johnson's
oh i saw her this morning
she wouldn't talk to me but i met george amberson on my way back and he told me what you'd done over there
and do you dream i thought you'd do what you've done here this afternoon to eugene
oh i knew that too
i was looking out of the front bedroom window and i saw him drive up and then go away again and i knew you'd been to the door
of course he went to george amberson about it and that's why george is here
he's got to tell isabel the whole thing now and you wanted to go in there interferinggod knows what
you stay here and let her brother tell her he's got some consideration for her  i suppose you think i haven't george said challenging her and at that fanny laughed witheringly
you
considerate of anybody  i'm considerate of her good name he said hotly
it seems to me that's about the first thing to be considerate of in being considerate of a person
and look here it strikes me you're taking a pretty different tack from what you did yesterday afternoon  fanny wrung her hands
i did a terrible thing she lamented
now that it's done and too late i know what it was
i didn't have sense enough just to let things go on
i didn't have any business to interfere and i didn't mean to interferei only wanted to talk and let out a little
i did think you already knew everything i told you
i did
and i'd rather have cut my hand off than stir you up to doing what you have done
i was just suffering so that i wanted to let out a littlei didn't mean any real harm
but now i see what's happenedoh i was a fool
i hadn't any business interfering
eugene never would have looked at me anyhow and oh why couldn't i have seen that before
he never came here a single time in his life except on her account never
and i might have let them alone because he wouldn't have looked at me even if he'd never seen isabel
and they haven't done any harm she made wilbur happy and she was a true wife to him as long as he lived
it wasn't a crime for her to care for eugene all the time she certainly never told him she didand she gave me every chance in the world
she left us alone together every time she couldeven since wilbur diedbut what was the use
and here i go not doing myself a bit of good by it and justfanny wrung her hands againjust ruining them  i suppose you mean i'm doing that george said bitterly
yes i do she sobbed and drooped upon the stairway railing exhausted
on the contrary i mean to save my mother from a calamity  fanny looked at him wanly in a tired despair then she stepped by him and went slowly to her own door where she paused and beckoned to him
what do you want  just come here a minute  what for he asked impatiently
i just wanted to say something to you  well for heaven's sake say it
there's nobody to hear nevertheless after a moment as she beckoned him again he went to her profoundly annoyed
well what is it  george she said in a low voice i think you ought to be told something
if i were you i'd let my mother alone  oh my lord he groaned
i'm doing these things for her not against her  a mildness had come upon fanny and she had controlled her weeping
she shook her head gently
no i'd let her alone if i were you
i don't think she's very well george  she
i never saw a healthier person in my life  no
she doesn't let anybody know but she goes to the doctor regularly  women are always going to doctors regularly  no
he told her to  george was not impressed
it's nothing at all she spoke of it to me years agosome kind of family failing
she said grandfather had it too and look at him
hasn't proved very serious with him
you act as if i'd done something wrong in sending that man about his business and as if i were going to persecute my mother instead of protecting her
by jove it's sickening
you told me how all the riffraff in town were busy with her name and then the minute i lift my hand to protect her you begin to attack me and  sh fanny checked him laying her hand on his arm
your uncle is going  the library doors were heard opening and a moment later there came the sound of the front door closing
george moved toward the head of the stairs then stood listening but the house was silent
fanny made a slight noise with her lips to attract his attention and when he glanced toward her shook her head at him urgently
let her alone she whispered
she's down there by herself
don't go down
let her alone  she moved a few steps toward him and halted her face pallid and awestruck and then both stood listening for anything that might break the silence downstairs
no sound came to them that poignant silence was continued throughout long long minutes while the two listeners stood there under its mysterious spell and in its plaintive eloquencespeaking as it did of the figure alone in the big dark library where dead wilbur's new silver frame gleamed in the dimnessthere was something that checked even george
above the aunt and nephew as they kept this strange vigil there was a triple window of stained glass to illumine the landing and upper reaches of the stairway
figures in blue and amber garments posed gracefully in panels conceived by some craftsman of the eighties to represent love and purity and beauty and these figures leaded to unalterable attitudes were little more motionless than the two human beings upon whom fell the mottled faint light of the window
the colours were growing dull evening was coming on
fanny minafer broke the long silence with a sound from her throat a stilled gasp and with that great companion of hers her handkerchief retired softly to the loneliness of her own chamber
after she had gone george looked about him bleakly then on tiptoe crossed the hall and went into his own room which was filled with twilight
still tiptoeing though he could not have said why he went across the room and sat down heavily in a chair facing the window
outside there was nothing but the darkening air and the wall of the nearest of the new houses
he had not slept at all the night before and he had eaten nothing since the preceding day at lunch but he felt neither drowsiness nor hunger
his set determination filled him kept him but too wide awake and his gaze at the grayness beyond the window was wideeyed and bitter
darkness had closed in when there was a step in the room behind him
then someone knelt beside the chair two arms went round him with infinite compassion a gentle head rested against his shoulder and there came the faint scent as of appleblossoms far away
you mustn't be troubled darling his mother whispered
chapter xxvi   george choked
for an instant he was on the point of breaking down but he commanded himself bravely dismissing the selfpity roused by her compassion
how can i help but be he said
no no she soothed him
you mustn't
you mustn't be troubled no matter what happens  that's easy enough to say he protested and he moved as if to rise
just let's stay like this a little while dear
just a minute or two
i want to tell you brother george has been here and he told me everything aboutabout how unhappy you'd beenand how you went so gallantly to that old woman with the operaglasses isabel gave a sad little laugh
what a terrible old woman she is
what a really terrible thing a vulgar old woman can be  mother i and again he moved to rise
must you
it seemed to me such a comfortable way to talk
well she yielded he rose helped her to her feet and pressed the light into being
as the room took life from the sudden lines of fire within the bulbs isabel made a deprecatory gesture and with a faint laugh of apologetic protest turned quickly away from george
what she meant was you mustn't see my face until i've made it nicer for you then she turned again to him her eyes downcast but no sign of tears in them and she contrived to show him that there was the semblance of a smile upon her lips
she still wore her hat and in her unsteady fingers she held a white envelope somewhat crumpled
now mother  wait dearest she said and though he stood stone cold she lifted her arms put them round him again and pressed her cheek lightly to his
oh you do look so troubled poor dear
one thing you couldn't doubt beloved boy you know i could never care for anything in the world as i care for younever never  now mother  she released him and stepped back
just a moment more dearest
i want you to read this first
we can get at things better she pressed into his hand the envelope she had brought with her and as he opened it and began to read the long enclosure she walked slowly to the other end of the room then stood there with her back to him and her head drooping a little until he had finished
the sheets of paper were covered with eugene's handwriting
george amberson will bring you this dear isabel
he is waiting while i write
he and i have talked things over and before he gives this to you he will tell you what has happened
of course i'm rather confused and haven't had time to think matters out very definitely and yet i believe i should have been better prepared for what took place todayi ought to have known it was coming because i have understood for quite a long time that young george was getting to dislike me more and more
somehow i've never been able to get his friendship he's always had a latent distrust of meor something like distrustand perhaps that's made me sometimes a little awkward and diffident with him
i think it may be he felt from the first that i cared a great deal about you and he naturally resented it
i think perhaps he felt this even during all the time when i was so carefulat least i thought i wasnot to show even to you how immensely i did care
and he may have feared that you were thinking too much about meeven when you weren't and only liked me as an old friend
it's perfectly comprehensible to me also that at his age one gets excited about gossip
dear isabel what i'm trying to get at in my confused way is that you and i don't care about this nonsensical gossip ourselves at all
yesterday i thought the time had come when i could ask you to marry me and you were dear enough to tell me sometime it might come to that well you and i left to ourselves and knowing what we have been and what we are we'd pay as much attention to talk as we would to any other kind of old cats' mewing
we'd not be very apt to let such things keep us from the plenty of life we have left to us for making up to ourselves for old unhappinesses and mistakes
but now we're faced withnot the slander and not our own fear of it because we haven't any but someone else's fear of ityour son's
and oh dearest woman in the world i know what your son is to you and it frightens me
let me explain a little i don't think he'll changeat twentyone or twentytwo so many things appear solid and permanent and terrible which forty sees are nothing but disappearing miasma
forty can't tell twenty about this that's the pity of it
twenty can find out only by getting to be forty
and so we come to this dear will you live your own life your way or george's way
i'm going a little further because it would be fatal not to be wholly frank now
george will act toward you only as your long worship of him your sacrificesall the unseen little ones every day since he was bornwill make him act
dear it breaks my heart for you but what you have to oppose now is the history of your own selfless and perfect motherhood
i remember saying once that what you worshipped in your son was the angel you saw in himand i still believe that is true of every mother
but in a mother's worship she may not see that the will in her son should not always be offered incense along with the angel
i grow sick with fear for youfor both you and mewhen i think how the will against us two has grown strong through the love you have given the angeland how long your own sweet will has served that other
are you strong enough isabel
can you make the fight
i promise you that if you will take heart for it you will find so quickly that it has all amounted to nothing
you shall have happiness and in a little while only happiness
you need only to write me a linei can't come to your houseand tell me where you will meet me
we will come back in a month and the angel in your son will bring him to you i promise it
what is good in him will grow so fine once you have beaten the turbulent willbut it must be beaten
your brother that good friend is waiting with such patience i should not keep him longerand i am saying too much for wisdom i fear
but oh my dear won't you be strongsuch a little short strength it would need
don't strike my life down twice dearthis time i've not deserved it
eugene
concluding this missive george tossed it abruptly from him so that one sheet fell upon his bed and the others upon the floor and at the faint noise of their falling isabel came and kneeling began to gather them up
did you read it dear  george's face was pale no longer but pink with fury
yes i did  all of it she asked gently as she rose
certainly  she did not look at him but kept her eyes downcast upon the letter in her hands tremulously rearranging the sheets in order as she spokeand though she smiled her smile was as tremulous as her hands
nervousness and an irresistible timidity possessed her
ii wanted to say george she faltered
i felt that ifif some day it should happeni mean if you came to feel differently about it and eugene and ithat is if we found that it seemed the most sensible thing to doi was afraid you might think it would be a little queer aboutlucy i mean ifif she were your stepsister
of course she'd not be even legally related to you and if youif you cared for her  thus far she got stumblingly with what she wanted to say while george watched her with a gaze that grew harder and hotter but here he cut her off
i have already given up all idea of lucy he said
naturally i couldn't have treated her father as i deliberately did treat himi could hardly have done that and expected his daughter ever to speak to me again  isabel gave a quick cry of compassion but he allowed her no opportunity to speak
you needn't think i'm making any particular sacrifice he said sharply though i would quickly enough if i thought it necessary in a matter of honour like this
i was interested in her and i could even say i did care for her but she proved pretty satisfactorily that she cared little enough about me
she went away right in the midst of aof a difference of opinion we were having she didn't even let me know she was going and never wrote a line to me and then came back telling everybody she'd had 'a perfectly gorgeous time'
that's quite enough for me
i'm not precisely the sort to arrange for that kind of thing to be done to me more than once
the truth is we're not congenial and we'd found that much out at least before she left
we should never have been happy she was 'superior' all the time and critical of menot very pleasant that
i was disappointed in her and i might as well say it
i don't think she has the very deepest nature in the world and  but isabel put her hand timidly on his arm
georgie dear this is only a quarrel all young people have them before they get adjusted and you mustn't let  if you please he said emphatically moving back from her
this isn't that kind
it's all over and i don't care to speak of it again
it's settled
don't you understand  but dear  no
i want to talk to you about this letter of her father's  yes dear that's why  it's simply the most offensive piece of writing that i've ever held in my hands  she stepped back from him startled
but dear i thought  i can't understand your even showing me such a thing he cried
how did you happen to bring it to me  your uncle thought i'd better
he thought it was the simplest thing to do and he said that he'd suggested it to eugene and eugene had agreed
they thought  yes george said bitterly
i should like to hear what they thought  they thought it would be the most straightforward thing  george drew a long breath
well what do you think mother  i thought it would be the simplest and most straightforward thing i thought they were right  very well
we'll agree it was simple and straightforward
now what do you think of that letter itself  she hesitated looking away
iof course i don't agree with him in the way he speaks of you dearexcept about the angel
i don't agree with some of the things he implies
you've always been unselfishnobody knows that better than your mother
when fanny was left with nothing you were so quick and generous to give up what really should have come to you and  and yet george broke in you see what he implies about me
don't you think really that this was a pretty insulting letter for that man to be asking you to hand your son  oh no she cried
you can see how fair he means to be and he didn't ask for me to give it to you
it was brother george who  never mind that now
you say he tries to be fair and yet do you suppose it ever occurs to him that i'm doing my simple duty
that i'm doing what my father would do if he were alive
that i'm doing what my father would ask me to do if he could speak from his grave out yonder
do you suppose it ever occurs to that man for one minute that i'm protecting my mother george raised his voice advancing upon the helpless lady fiercely and she could only bend her head before him
he talks about my 'will'how it must be beaten down yes and he asks my mother to do that little thing to please him
what for
why does he want me 'beaten' by my mother
because i'm trying to protect her name
he's got my mother's name bandied up and down the streets of this town till i can't step in those streets without wondering what every soul i meet is thinking of me and of my family and now he wants you to marry him so that every gossip in town will say 'there
what did i tell you
i guess that proves it's true'
you can't get away from it that's exactly what they'd say and this man pretends he cares for you and yet asks you to marry him and give them the right to say it
he says he and you don't care what they say but i know better
he may not careprobably he's that kindbut you do
there never was an amberson yet that would let the amberson name go trailing in the dust like that
it's the proudest name in this town and it's going to stay the proudest and i tell you that's the deepest thing in my naturenot that i'd expect eugene morgan to understandthe very deepest thing in my nature is to protect that name and to fight for it to the last breath when danger threatens it as it does nowthrough my mother he turned from her striding up and down and tossing his arms about in a tumult of gesture
i can't believe it of you that you'd think of such a sacrilege
that's what it would besacrilege
when he talks about your unselfishness toward me he's rightyou have been unselfish and you have been a perfect mother
but what about him
is it unselfish of him to want you to throw away your good name just to please him
that's all he asks of youand to quit being my mother
do you think i can believe you really care for him
i don't
you are my mother and you're an ambersonand i believe you're too proud
you're too proud to care for a man who could write such a letter as that he stopped faced her and spoke with more selfcontrol well what are you going to do about it mother  george was right about his mother's being proud
and even when she laughed with a negro gardener or even those few times in her life when people saw her weep isabel had a proud looksomething that was independent and graceful and strong
but she did not have it now she leaned against the wall beside his dressingtable and seemed beset with humility and with weakness
her head drooped
what answer are you going to make to such a letter george demanded like a judge on the bench
ii don't quite know dear she murmured
wait she begged him
i'm soconfused  i want to know what you're going to write him
do you think if you did what he wants you to i could bear to stay another day in this town mother
do you think i could ever bear even to see you again if you married him
i'd want to but you surely know i justcouldn't  she made a futile gesture and seemed to breathe with difficulty
ii wasn'tquite sure she faltered aboutabout it's being wise for us to be marriedeven before knowing how you feel about it
i wasn't even sure it was quite fair toto eugene
i havei seem to have that family troublelike father'sthat i spoke to you about once she managed a deprecatory little dry laugh
not that it amounts to much but i wasn't at all sure that it would be fair to him
marrying doesn't mean so much after allnot at my age
it's enough to know thatthat people think of youand to see them
i thought we were alloh pretty happy the way things were and i don't think it would mean giving up a great deal for him or me either if we just went on as we have been
ii see him almost every day and  mother george's voice was loud and stern
do you think you could go on seeing him after this  she had been talking helplessly enough before her tone was little more broken now
notnot evensee him  how could you george cried
mother it seems to me that if he ever set foot in this house againoh
i can't speak of it
could you see him knowing what talk it makes every time he turns into this street and knowing what that means to me
oh i don't understand all thisi don't
if you'd told me a year ago that such things were going to happen i'd have thought you were insaneand now i believe i am  then after a preliminary gesture of despair as though he meant harm to the ceiling he flung himself heavily face downward upon the bed
his anguish was none the less real for its vehemence and the stricken lady came to him instantly and bent over him once more enfolding him in her arms
she said nothing but suddenly her tears fell upon his head she saw them and seemed to be startled
oh this won't do she said
i've never let you see me cry before except when your father died
i mustn't  and she ran from the room
a little while after she had gone george rose and began solemnly to dress for dinner
at one stage of these conscientious proceedings he put on temporarily his long black velvet dressinggown and happening to catch sight in his pier glass of the picturesque and medieval figure thus presented he paused to regard it and something profoundly theatrical in his nature came to the surface
his lips moved he whispered halfaloud some famous fragments  tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black  for in truth the mirrored princely image with hair dishevelled on the white brow and the long tragic fall of black velvet from the shoulders had brought about in his thought at least some comparisons of his own times so out of joint with those of that other gentle prince and heir whose widowed mother was minded to marry again
but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe  not less like hamlet did he feel and look as he sat gauntly at the dinner table with fanny to partake of a meal throughout which neither spoke
isabel had sent word not to wait for her an injunction it was as well they obeyed for she did not come at all
but with the renewal of sustenance furnished to his system some relaxation must have occurred within the highstrung george
dinner was not quite finished when without warning sleep hit him hard
his burning eyes could no longer restrain the lids above them his head sagged beyond control and he got to his feet and went lurching upstairs yawning with exhaustion
from the door of his room which he closed mechanically with his eyes shut he went blindly to his bed fell upon it soddenly and sleptwith his face full upturned to the light
it was after midnight when he woke and the room was dark
he had not dreamed but he woke with the sense that somebody or something had been with him while he sleptsomebody or something infinitely compassionate somebody or something infinitely protective that would let him come to no harm and to no grief
he got up and pressed the light on
pinned to the cover of his dressingtable was a square envelope with the words for you dear  written in pencil upon it
but the message inside was in ink a little smudged here and there
i have been out to the mailbox darling with a letter i've written to eugene and he'll have it in the morning
it would be unfair not to let him know at once and my decision could not change if i waited
it would always be the same
i think it is a little better for me to write to you like this instead of waiting till you wake up and then telling you because i'm foolish and might cry again and i took a vow once long ago that you should never see me cry
not that i'll feel like crying when we talk things over tomorrow
i'll be all right and fine  as you say so often by that timedon't fear
i think what makes me most ready to cry now is the thought of the terrible suffering in your poor face and the unhappy knowledge that it is i your mother who put it there
it shall never come again
i love you better than anything and everything else on earth
god gave you to meand oh
how thankful i have been every day of my life for that sacred giftand nothing can ever come between me and god's gift
i cannot hurt you and i cannot let you stay hurt as you have beennot another instant after you wake up my darling boy
it is beyond my power
and eugene was righti know you couldn't change about this
your suffering shows how deepseated the feeling is within you
so i've written him just about what i think you would like me tothough i told him i would always be fond of him and always his best friend and i hoped his dearest friend
he'll understand about not seeing him
he'll understand that though i didn't say it in so many words
you mustn't trouble about thathe'll understand
goodnight my darling my beloved my beloved
you mustn't be troubled
i think i shouldn't mind anything very much so long as i have you all to myselfas people sayto make up for your long years away from me at college
we'll talk of what's best to do in the morning shan't we
and for all this pain you'll forgive your loving and devoted mother
isabel
chapter xxvii   having finished some errands downtown the next afternoon george amberson minafer was walking up national avenue on his homeward way when he saw in the distance coming toward him upon the same side of the street the figure of a young ladya figure just under the middle height comely indeed and to be mistaken for none other in the worldeven at two hundred yards
to his sharp discomfiture his heart immediately forced upon him the consciousness of its acceleration a sudden warmth about his neck made him aware that he had turned red and then departing left him pale
for a panicky moment he thought of facing about in actual flight he had little doubt that lucy would meet him with no token of recognition and all at once this probability struck him as unendurable
and if she did not speak was it the proper part of chivalry to lift his hat and take the cut bareheaded
or should the finer gentleman acquiesce in the lady's desire for no further acquaintance and pass her with stony mien and eyes constrained forward
george was a young man badly flustered
but the girl approaching him was unaware of his trepidation being perhaps somewhat preoccupied with her own
she saw only that he was pale and that his eyes were darkly circled
but here he was advantaged with her for the finest touch to his good looks was given by this toning down neither pallor nor dark circles detracting from them but rather adding to them a melancholy favour of distinction
george had retained his mourning a tribute completed down to the final details of black gloves and a polished ebony cane which he would have been pained to name otherwise than as a walkingstick and in the aura of this sombre elegance his straight figure and drawn face were not without a tristful and appealing dignity
in everything outward he was cause enough for a girl's cheek to flush her heart to beat faster and her eyes to warm with the soft light that came into lucy's now whether she would or no
if his spirit had been what his looks proclaimed it she would have rejoiced to let the light glow forth which now shone in spite of her
for a long time thinking of that spirit of his and what she felt it should be she had a persistent sense it must be there but she had determined to believe this folly no longer
nevertheless when she met him at the sharons' she had been far less calm than she seemed
people speaking casually of lucy were apt to define her as a little beauty a definition short of the mark
she was a little beauty but an independent masterful sellreliant little american of whom her father's earlier gipsyings and her own sturdiness had made a woman ever since she was fifteen
but though she was the mistress of her own ways and no slave to any lamp save that of her own conscience she had a weakness she had fallen in love with george amberson minafer at first sight and no matter how she disciplined herself she had never been able to climb out
the thing had happened to her that was all
george had looked just the way she had always wanted someone to lookthe riskiest of all the moonshine ambushes wherein tricky romance snares credulous young love
but what was fatal to lucy was that this thing having happened to her she could not change it
no matter what she discovered in george's nature she was unable to take away what she had given him and though she could think differently about him she could not feel differently about him for she was one of those too faithful victims of glamour
when she managed to keep the picture of george away from her mind's eye she did well enough but when she let him become visible she could not choose but love what she disdained
she was a little angel who had fallen in love with highhanded lucifer quite an experience and not apt to be soon succeeded by any falling in love with a tamer partyand the unhappy truth was that george did make better men seem tame
but though she was a victim she was a heroic one anything but helpless
as they drew nearer george tried to prepare himself to meet her with some remnants of aplomb
he decided that he would keep on looking straight ahead and lift his hand toward his hat at the very last moment when it would be possible for her to see him out of the corner of her eye then when she thought it over later she would not be sure whether he had saluted her or merely rubbed his forehead
and there was the added benefit that any third person who might chance to look from a window or from a passing carriage would not think that he was receiving a snub because he did not intend to lift his hat but timing the gesture properly would in fact actually rub his forehead
these were the hasty plans which occupied his thoughts until he was within about fifty feet of herwhen he ceased to have either plans or thoughts he had kept his eyes from looking full at her until then and as he saw her thus close at hand and coming nearer a regret that was dumfounding took possession of him
for the first time he had the sense of having lost something of overwhelming importance
lucy did not keep to the right but came straight to meet him smiling and with her hand offered to him
whyyou he stammered as he took it
haven't you what he meant to say was haven't you heard  haven't i what she asked and he saw that eugene had not yet told her
nothing he gasped
may imay i turn and walk with you a little way  yes indeed she said cordially
he would not have altered what had been done he was satisfied with all thatsatisfied that it was right and that his own course was right
but he began to perceive a striking inaccuracy in some remarks he had made to his mother
now when he had put matters in such shape that even by the relinquishment of his ideals of life he could not have lucy knew that he could never have her and knew that when eugene told her the history of yesterday he could not have a glance or word even friendly from hernow when he must in good truth give up all idea of lucy he was amazed that he could have used such words as no particular sacrifice and believed them when he said them
she had looked never in his life so bewitchingly pretty as she did today and as he walked beside her he was sure that she was the most exquisite thing in the world
lucy he said huskily i want to tell you something
something that matters  i hope it's a lively something then she said and laughed
papa's been so glum today he's scarcely spoken to me
your uncle george amberson came to see him an hour ago and they shut themselves up in the library and your uncle looked as glum as papa
i'd be glad if you'll tell me a funny story george  well it may seem one to you he said bitterly just to begin with when you went away you didn't let me know not even a wordnot a line  her manner persisted in being inconsequent
why no she said
i just trotted off for some visits  well at least you might have  why no she said again briskly
don't you remember george
we'd had a grand quarrel and didn't speak to each other all the way home from a long long drive
so as we couldn't play together like good children of course it was plain that we oughtn't to play at all  play he cried
yes
what i mean is that we'd come to the point where it was time to quit playingwell what we were playing  at being lovers you mean don't you  something like that she said lightly
for us two playing at being lovers was just the same as playing at crosspurposes
i had all the purposes and that gave you all the crossness things weren't getting along at all
it was absurd  well have it your own way he said
it needn't have been absurd  no it couldn't help but be she informed him cheerfully
the way i am and the way you are it couldn't ever be anything else
so what was the use  i don't know he sighed and his sigh was abysmal
but what i wanted to tell you is this when you went away you didn't let me know and didn't care how or when i heard it but i'm not like that with you
this time i'm going away
that's what i wanted to tell you
i'm going away tomorrow nightindefinitely  she nodded sunnily
that's nice for you
i hope you'll have ever so jolly a time george  i don't expect to have a particularly jolly time  well then she laughed if i were you i don't think i'd go  it seemed impossible to impress this distracting creature to make her serious
lucy he said desperately this is our last walk together  evidently she said if you're going away tomorrow night  lucythis may be the last time i'll see youeverever in my life  at that she looked at him quickly across her shoulder but she smiled as brightly as before and with the same cordial inconsequence oh i can hardly think that she said
and of course i'd be awfully sorry to think it
you're not moving away are you to live  no  and even if you were of course you'd be coming back to visit your relatives every now and then  i don't know when i'm coming back
mother and i are starting tomorrow night for a trip around the world  at this she did look thoughtful
your mother is going with you  good heavens he groaned
lucy doesn't it make any difference to you that i am going  at this her cordial smile instantly appeared again
yes of course  she said
i'm sure i'll miss you ever so much
are you to be gone long  he stared at her wanly
i told you indefinitely he said
we've made no plansat allfor coming back  that does sound like a long trip she exclaimed admiringly
do you plan to be travelling all the time or will you stay in some one place the greater part of it
i think it would be lovely to  lucy  he halted and she stopped with him
they had come to a corner at the edge of the business section of the city and people were everywhere about them brushing against them sometimes in passing
i can't stand this george said in a low voice
i'm just about ready to go in this drugstore here and ask the clerk for something to keep me from dying in my tracks
it's quite a shock you see lucy  what is  to find out certainly at last how deeply you've cared for me
to see how much difference this makes to you
by jove i have mattered to you  her cordial smile was tempered now with goodnature
george she laughed indulgently
surely you don't want me to do pathos on a downtown corner  you wouldn't 'do pathos' anywhere  welldon't you think pathos is generally rather fooling  i can't stand this any longer he said
i can't
goodbye lucy he took her hand
it's goodbyei think it's goodbye for good lucy  goodbye
i do hope you'll have the most splendid trip she gave his hand a cordial little grip then released it lightly
give my love to your mother
goodbye  he turned heavily away and a moment later glanced back over his shoulder
she had not gone on but stood watching him that same casual cordial smile on her face to the very last and now as he looked back she emphasized her friendly unconcern by waving her small hand to him cheerily though perhaps with the slightest hint of preoccupation as if she had begun to think of the errand that brought her downtown
in his mind george had already explained her to his own poignant dissatisfactionsome blond pup probably whom she had met during that perfectly gorgeous time and he strode savagely onward not looking back again
but lucy remained where she was until he was out of sight
then she went slowly into the drugstore which had struck george as a possible source of stimulant for himself
please let me have a few drops of aromatic spirits of ammonia in a glass of water she said with the utmost composure
yes ma'am said the impressionable clerk who had been looking at her through the display window as she stood on the corner
but a moment later as he turned from the shelves of glass jars against the wall with the potion she had asked for in his hand he uttered an exclamation for goshes' sake miss and describing this adventure to his fellowboarders that evening sagged pretty near to the counter she was he said
if i hadn't been a bright quick readyforanything young fella she'd 'a' flummixed plum
i was watchin' her out the windowtalkin' to some young s'iety fella and she was all right then
she was all right when she come in the store too
yes sir the prettiest girl that ever walked in our place and took one good look at me
i reckon it must be the truth what some you town wags say about my face     chapter xxviii   at that hour the heroine of the susceptible clerk's romance was engaged in brightening the rosy little coal fire under the white mantelpiece in her pretty whiteandblue boudoir
four photographs all framed in decorous plain silver went to the anthracite's fierce destructionframes and alland three packets of letters and notes in a charming florentine treasurebox of painted wood nor was the box any more than the silver frames spared this rousing finish
thrown heartily upon live coal the fine wood sparkled forth in stars then burst into an alarming blaze which scorched the white mantelpiece but lucy stood and looked on without moving
it was not eugene who told her what had happened at isabel's door
when she got home she found fanny minafer waiting for hera secret excursion of fanny's for the purpose presumably of letting out  again because that was what she did
she told lucy everything except her own lamentable part in the production of the recent miseries and concluded with a tribute to george the worst of it is he thinks he's been such a hero and isabel does too and that makes him more than twice as awful
it's been the same all his life everything he did was noble and perfect
he had a domineering nature to begin with and she let it go on and fostered it till it absolutely ruled her
i never saw a plainer case of a person's fault making them pay for having it
she goes about overseeing the packing and praising george and pretending to be perfectly cheerful about what he's making her do and about the dreadful things he's done
she pretends he did such a fine thingso manly and protectivegoing to mrs johnson
and so heroicdoing what his 'principles' made himeven though he knew what it would cost him with you
and all the while it's almost killing herwhat he said to your father
she's always been lofty enough so to speak and had the greatest idea of the ambersons being superior to the rest of the world and all that but rudeness or anything like a 'scene' or any bad mannersthey always just made her sick
but she could never see what george's manners wereoh it's been a terrible adulation
it's going to be a task for me living in that big house all alone you must come and see mei mean after they've gone of course
i'll go crazy if i don't see something of people
i'm sure you'll come as often as you can
i know you too well to think you'll be sensitive about coming there or being reminded of george
thank heaven you're too wellbalanced miss fanny concluded with a profound fervour you're too wellbalanced to let anything affect you deeply about thatthat monkey  the four photographs and the painted florentine box went to their cremation within the same hour that miss fanny spoke and a little later lucy called her father in as he passed her door and pointed to the blackened area on the underside of the mantelpiece and to the burnt heap upon the coal where some metallic shapes still retained outline
she flung her arms about his neck in passionate sympathy telling him that she knew what had happened to him and presently he began to comfort her and managed an embarrassed laugh
well well he said
i was too old for such foolishness to be getting into my head anyhow  no no she sobbed
and if you knew how i despise myself forfor ever having thought one instant aboutoh miss fanny called him the right name that monkey
he is  there i think i agree with you eugene said grimly and in his eyes there was a steady light of anger that was to last
yes i think i agree with you about that  there's only one thing to do with such a person she said vehemently
that's to put him out of our thoughts foreverforever  and yet the next day at six o'clock which was the hour fanny had told her when george and his mother were to leave upon their long journey lucy touched that scorched place on her mantel with her hand just as the little clock above it struck
then after this odd unconscious gesture she went to a window and stood between the curtains looking out into the cold november dusk and in spite of every reasoning and reasonable power within her a pain of loneliness struck through her heart
the dim street below her window the dark houses across the way the vague air itselfall looked empty and cold and most of all uninteresting
something more sombre than november dusk took the colour from them and gave them that air of desertion
the light of her fire flickering up behind her showed suddenly a flying group of tiny snowflakes nearing the windowpane and for an instant she felt the sensation of being dragged through a snows drift under a broken cutter with a boy's arms about heran arrogant handsome tooconquering boy who nevertheless did his best to get hurt himself keeping her from any possible harm
she shook the picture out of her eyes indignantly then came and sat before her fire and looked long and long at the blackened mantelpiece
she did not have the mantelpiece repaintedand since she did not might as well have kept his photographs
one forgets what made the scar upon his hand but not what made the scar upon his wall
she played no marche funebre upon her piano even though chopin's romantic lamentation was then at the top of ninetenths of the musicracks in the country american youth having recently discovered the distinguished congeniality between itself and this deathless bit of deathly gloom
she did not even play robin adair she played bedelia  and all the new cakewalks for she was her father's housekeeper and rightly looked upon the office as being the same as that of his heartkeeper
therefore it was her affair to keep both house and heart in what state of cheerfulness might be contrived
she made him go out  more than ever made him take her to all the gayeties of that winter declining to go herself unless he took her and though eugene danced no more and quoted shakespeare to prove all lightfoot caperings beneath the dignity of his age she broke his resolution for him at the new year's eve assembly and half coaxed half dragged him forth upon the floor and made him dance the new year in with her
new faces appeared at the dances of the winter new faces had been appearing everywhere for that matter and familiar ones were disappearing merged in the increasing crowd or gone forever and missed a little and not long for the town was growing and changing as it never had grown and changed before
it was heaving up in the middle incredibly it was spreading incredibly and as it heaved and spread it befouled itself and darkened its sky
its boundary was mere shapelessness on the run a raw new house would appear on a country road four or five others would presently be built at intervals between it and the outskirts of the town the country road would turn into an asphalt street with a brickfaced drugstore and a frame grocery at a corner then bungalows and sixroom cottages would swiftly speckle the open green spacesand a farm had become a suburb which would immediately shoot out other suburbs into the country on one side and on the other join itself solidly to the city
you drove between pleasant fields and woodland groves one spring day and in the autumn passing over the same ground you were warned off the tracks by an interurban trolleycar's gonging and beheld beyond cement sidewalks just dry new houseowners busy moving in gasoline and electricity were performing the miracles eugene had predicted
but the great change was in the citizenry itself
what was left of the patriotic oldstock generation that had fought the civil war and subsequently controlled politics had become venerable and was little heeded
the descendants of the pioneers and early settlers were merging into the new crowd becoming part of it little to be distinguished from it
what happened to boston and to broadway happened in degree to the midland city the old stock became less and less typical and of the grown people who called the place home less than a third had been born in it
there was a german quarter there was a jewish quarter there was a negro quartersquare miles of itcalled bucktown there were many irish neighbourhoods and there were large settlements of italians and of hungarians and of rumanians and of serbians and other balkan peoples
but not the emigrants themselves were the almost dominant type on the streets downtown
that type was the emigrant's prosperous offspring descendant of the emigrations of the seventies and eighties and nineties those great folkjourneyings in search not so directly of freedom and democracy as of more money for the same labour
a new midlanderin fact a new americanwas beginning dimly to emerge
a new spirit of citizenship had already sharply defined itself
it was idealistic and its ideals were expressed in the new kind of young men in business downtown
they were optimistsoptimists to the point of belligerencetheir motto being boost
don't knock and they were hustlers believing in hustling and in honesty because both paid
they loved their city and worked for it with a plutonic energy which was always ardently vocal
they were viciously governed but they sometimes went so far to struggle for better government on account of the helpful effect of good government on the price of real estate and betterment  generally the politicians could not go too far with them and knew it
the idealists planned and strove and shouted that their city should become a better better and better cityand what they meant when they used the word better was more prosperous and the core of their idealism was this the more prosperous my beloved city the more prosperous beloved i they had one supreme theory that the perfect beauty and happiness of cities and of human life was to be brought about by more factories they had a mania for factories there was nothing they would not do to cajole a factory away from another city and they were never more piteously embittered than when another city cajoled one away from them
what they meant by prosperity was credit at the bank but in exchange for this credit they got nothing that was not dirty and therefore to a sane mind valueless since whatever was cleaned was dirty again before the cleaning was half done
for as the town grew it grew dirty with an incredible completeness
the idealists put up magnificent business buildings and boasted of them but the buildings were begrimed before they were finished
they boasted of their libraries of their monuments and statues and poured soot on them
they boasted of their schools but the schools were dirty like the children within them
this was not the fault of the children or their mothers
it was the fault of the idealists who said the more dirt the more prosperity they drew patriotic optimistic breaths of the flying powdered filth of the streets and took the foul and heavy smoke with gusto into the profundities of their lungs
boost
don't knock they said
and every year or so they boomed a great cleanup week when everybody was supposed to get rid of the tin cans in his backyard
they were happiest when the tearing down and building up were most riotous and when new factory districts were thundering into life
in truth the city came to be like the body of a great dirty man skinned to show his busy works yet wearing a few barbaric ornaments and such a figure carved coloured and discoloured and set up in the marketplace would have done well enough as the god of the new people
such a god they had indeed made in their own image as all peoples make the god they truly serve though of course certain of the idealists went to church on sunday and there knelt to another considered to be impractical in business
but while the growing went on this god of their marketplace was their true god their familiar and spiritcontrol
they did not know that they were his helplessly obedient slaves nor could they ever hope to realize their serfdom as the first step toward becoming free men until they should make the strange and hard discovery that matter should serve man's spirit
prosperity meant good credit at the bank black lungs and housewives' purgatory
the women fought the dirt all they could but if they let the air into their houses they let in the dirt
it shortened their lives and kept them from the happiness of ever seeing anything white
and thus as the city grew the time came when lucy after a hard struggle had to give up her blueandwhite curtains and her white walls
indoors she put everything into dull gray and brown and outside had the little house painted the dark green nearest to black
then she knew of course that everything was as dirty as ever but was a little less distressed because it no longer looked so dirty as it was
these were bad times for amberson addition
this quarter already old lay within a mile of the centre of the town but business moved in other directions and the addition's share of prosperity was only the smoke and dirt with the bank credit left out
the owners of the original big houses sold them or rented them to boardinghouse keepers and the tenants of the multitude of small houses moved farther out where the smoke was thinner or into apartment houses which were built by dozens now
cheaper tenants took their places and the rents were lower and lower and the houses shabbier and shabbierfor all these shabby houses burning soft coal did their best to help in the destruction of their own value
they helped to make the quarter so dingy and the air so foul to breathe that no one would live there who had money enough to get farther out where there were glimpses of ungrayed sky and breaths of cleaner winds
and with the coming of the new speed farther out was now as close to business as the addition had been in the days of its prosperity
distances had ceased to matter
the five new houses built so closely where had been the fine lawn of the amberson mansion did not look new
when they were a year old they looked as old as they would ever look and two of them were vacant having never been rented for the major's mistake about apartment houses had been a disastrous one
he guessed wrong george amberson said he guessed wrong at just the wrong time
housekeeping in a house is harder than in an apartment and where the smoke and dirt are as thick as they are in the addition women can't stand it
people were crazy for apartmentstoo bad he couldn't have seen it in time
poor man
he digs away at his ledgers by his old gas droplight lamp almost every nighthe still refuses to let the mansion be torn up for wiring you know
but he had one painful satisfaction this spring he got his taxes lowered  amberson laughed ruefully and fanny minafer asked how the major could have managed such an economy
they were sitting upon the veranda at isabel's one evening during the third summer of the absence of their nephew and his mother and the conversation had turned toward amberson finances
i said it was a 'painful satisfaction' fanny he explained
the property has gone down in value and they assessed it lower than they did fifteen years ago  but farther out  oh yes 'farther out'
prices are magnificent 'farther out' and farther in too
we just happen to be the wrong spot that's all
not that i don't think something could be done if father would let me have a hand but he won't
he can't i suppose i ought to say
he's 'always done his own figuring' he says and it's his lifelong habit to keep his affairs and even his books to himself and just hand us out the money
heaven knows he's done enough of that  he sighed and both were silent looking out at the long flares of the constantly passing automobile headlights shifting in vast geometric demonstrations against the darkness
now and then a bicycle wound its nervous way among these portents or at long intervals a surrey or buggy plodded forlornly by
there seem to be so many ways of making money nowadays fanny said thoughtfully
every day i hear of a new fortune some person has got hold of one way or anothernearly always it's somebody you never heard of
it doesn't seem all to be in just making motor cars i hear there's a great deal in manufacturing these things that motor cars usenew inventions particularly
i met dear old frank bronson the other day and he told me  oh yes even dear old frank's got the fever amberson laughed
he's as wild as any of them
he told me about this invention he's gone into too
'millions in it'
some new electric headlight better than anything yet'every car in america can't help but have 'em' and all that
he's putting half he's laid by into it and the fact is he almost talked me into getting father to 'finance me' enough for me to go into it
poor father
he's financed me before
i suppose he would again if i had the heart to ask him and this seems to be a good thing though probably old frank is a little too sanguine
at any rate i've been thinking it over  so have i fanny admitted
he seemed to be certain it would pay twentyfive per cent
the first year and enormously more after that and i'm only getting four on my little principal
people are making such enormous fortunes out of everything to do with motor cars it does seem as if she paused
well i told him i'd think it over seriously  we may turn out to be partners and millionaires then amberson laughed
i thought i'd ask eugene's advice  i wish you would said fanny
he probably knows exactly how much profit there would be in this  eugene's advice was to go slow he thought electric lights for automobiles were comingsomeday but probably not until certain difficulties could be overcome altogether he was discouraging but by this time his two friends had the fever as thoroughly as old frank bronson himself had it for they had been with bronson to see the light working beautifully in a machine shop
they were already enthusiastic and after asking eugene's opinion they argued with him telling him how they had seen with their own eyes that the difficulties he mentioned had been overcome
perfectly fanny cried
and if it worked in the shop it's bound to work any place else isn't it  he would not agree that it was bound toyet being pressed was driven to admit that it might and retiring from what was developing into an oratorical contest repeated a warning about not putting too much into it  george amberson also laid stress on this caution later though the major had financed him again and he was going in you must be careful to leave yourself a 'margin of safety' fanny he said
i'm confident that is a pretty conservative investment of its kind and all the chances are with us but you must be careful to leave yourself enough to fall back on in case anything should go wrong  fanny deceived him
in the impossible event of anything going wrong  she would have enough left to live on she declared and laughed excitedly for she was having the best time that had come to her since wilbur's death
like so many women for whom money has always been provided without their understanding how she was prepared to be a thorough and irresponsible plunger
amberson in his wearier way shared her excitement and in the winter when the exploiting company had been formed and he brought fanny her importantly engraved shares of stock he reverted to his prediction of possibilities made when they first spoke of the new light
we seem to be partners all right he laughed
now let's go ahead and be millionaires before isabel and young george come home  when they come home she echoed sorrowfullyand it was a phrase which found an evasive echo in isabel's letters
in these letters isabel was always planning pleasant things that she and fanny and the major and george and brother george would dowhen she and her son came home
they'll find things pretty changed i'm afraid fanny said
if they ever do come home  amberson went over the next summer and joined his sister and nephew in paris where they were living
isabel does want to come home he told fanny gravely on the day of his return in october
she's wanted to for a long whileand she ought to come while she can stand the journey and he amplified this statement leaving fanny looking startled and solemn when lucy came by to drive him out to dinner at the new house eugene had just completed
this was no whiteandblue cottage but a great georgian picture in brick five miles north of amberson addition with four acres of its own hedged land between it and its next neighbour and amberson laughed wistfully as they turned in between the stone and brick gate pillars and rolled up the crushed stone driveway
i wonder lucy if history's going on forever repeating itself he said
i wonder if this town's going on building up things and rolling over them as poor father once said it was rolling over his poor old heart
it looks like it here's the amberson mansion again only it's georgian instead of nondescript romanesque but it's just the same amberson mansion that my father built long before you were born
the only difference is that it's your father who's built this one now
it's all the same in the long run  lucy did not quite understand but she laughed as a friend should and taking his arm showed him through vast rooms where ivorypanelled walls and trim window hangings were reflected dimly in dark rugless floors and the sparse furniture showed that lucy had been collecting with a long purse
by jove he said
you have been going it
fanny tells me you had a great 'housewarming' dance and you keep right on being the belle of the ball not any softerhearted than you used to be
fred kinney's father says you've refused fred so often that he got engaged to janie sharon just to prove that someone would have him in spite of his hair
well the material world do move and you've got the new kind of house it moves into nowadaysif it has the new price
and even the grand old expanses of plate glass we used to be so proud of at the other amberson mansionthey've gone too with the crowded heavy gold and red stuff
curious
we've still got the plate glass windows though all we can see out of 'em is the smoke and the old johnson house which is a counterjumper's boardinghouse now while you've got a view and you cut it all up into little panes
well you're pretty refreshingly out of the smoke up here  yes for a while lucy laughed
until it comes and we have to move out farther  no you'll stay here he assured her
it will be somebody else who'll move out farther  he continued to talk of the house after eugene arrived and gave them no account of his journey until they had retired from the dinner table to eugene's library a gray and shadowy room where their coffee was brought
then equipped with a cigar which seemed to occupy his attention amberson spoke in a casual tone of his sister and her son
i found isabel as well as usual he said only i'm afraid 'as usual' isn't particularly well
sydney and amelia had been up to paris in the spring but she hadn't seen them
somebody told her they were there it seems
they'd left florence and were living in rome amelia's become a catholic and is said to give great sums to charity and to go about with the gentry in consequence but sydney's ailing and lives in a wheelchair most of the time
it struck me isabel ought to be doing the same thing  he paused bestowing minute care upon the removal of the little band from his cigar and as he seemed to have concluded his narrative eugene spoke out of the shadow beyond a heavily shaded lamp what do you mean by that he asked quietly
oh she's cheerful enough said amberson still not looking at either his young hostess or her father
at least he added she manages to seem so
i'm afraid she hasn't been really well for several years
she isn't stout you knowshe hasn't changed in looks muchand she seems rather alarmingly short of breath for a slender person
father's been that way for years of course but never nearly so much as isabel is now
of course she makes nothing of it but it seemed rather serious to me when i noticed she had to stop and rest twice to get up the one short flight of stairs in their twofloor apartment
i told her i thought she ought to make george let her come home  let her eugene repeated in a low voice
does she want to  she doesn't urge it
george seems to like the life therein his grand gloomy and peculiar way and of course she'll never change about being proud of him and all thathe's quite a swell
but in spite of anything she said rather than because i know she does indeed want to come
she'd like to be with father of course and i think she'swell she intimated one day that she feared it might even happen that she wouldn't get to see him again
at the time i thought she referred to his age and feebleness but on the boat coming home i remembered the little look of wistfulness yet of resignation with which she said it and it struck me all at once that i'd been mistaken i saw she was really thinking of her own state of health  i see eugene said his voice even lower than it had been before
and you say he won't 'let' her come home  amberson laughed but still continued to be interested in his cigar
oh i don't think he uses force
he's very gentle with her
i doubt if the subject is mentioned between them and yetand yet knowing my interesting nephew as you do wouldn't you think that was about the way to put it  knowing him as i doyes said eugene slowly
yes i should think that was about the way to put it  a murmur out of the shadows beyond hima faint sound musical and feminine yet expressive of a notable intensityseemed to indicate that lucy was of the same opinion
chapter xxix    let her was correct but the time cameand it came in the spring of the next year when it was no longer a question of george's letting his mother come home
he had to bring her and to bring her quickly if she was to see her father again and amberson had been right her danger of never seeing him again lay not in the major's feebleness of heart but in her own
as it was george telegraphed his uncle to have a wheeled chair at the station for the journey had been disastrous and to this hybrid vehicle placed close to the platform her son carried her in his arms when she arrived
she was unable to speak but patted her brother's and fanny's hands and looked very sweet fanny found the desperate courage to tell her
she was lifted from the chair into a carriage and seemed a little stronger as they drove home for once she took her hand from george's and waved it feebly toward the carriage window
changed she whispered
so changed  you mean the town amberson said
you mean the old place is changed don't you dear  she smiled and moved her lips yes  it'll change to a happier place old dear he said now that you're back in it and going to get well again  but she only looked at him wistfully her eyes a little frightened
when the carriage stopped her son carried her into the house and up the stairs to her own room where a nurse was waiting and he came out a moment later as the doctor went in
at the end of the hall a stricken group was clustered amberson and fanny and the major
george deathly pale and speechless took his grandfather's hand but the old gentleman did not seem to notice his action
when are they going to let me see my daughter he asked querulously
they told me to keep out of the way while they carried her in because it might upset her
i wish they'd let me go in and speak to my daughter
i think she wants to see me  he was rightpresently the doctor came out and beckoned to him and the major shuffled forward leaning on a shaking cane his figure after all its years of proud soldierliness had grown stooping at last and his untrimmed white hair straggled over the back of his collar
he looked oldold and divested of the worldas he crept toward his daughter's room
her voice was stronger for the waiting group heard a low cry of tenderness and welcome as the old man reached the open doorway
then the door was closed
fanny touched her nephew's arm
george you must need something to eati know she'd want you to
i've had things ready i knew she'd want me to
you'd better go down to the dining room there's plenty on the table waiting for you
she'd want you to eat something  he turned a ghastly face to her it was so panicstricken
i don't want anything to eat he said savagely
and he began to pace the floor taking care not to go near isabel's door and that his footsteps were muffled by the long thick hall rug
after a while he went to where amberson with folded arms and bowed head had seated himself near the front window
uncle george he said hoarsely
i didn't  well  oh my god i didn't think this thing the matter with her could ever be serious
i he gasped
when that doctor i had meet us at the boat  he could not go on
amberson only nodded his head and did not otherwise change his attitude
isabel lived through the night
at eleven o'clock fanny came timidly to george in his room
eugene is here she whispered
he's downstairs
he wants she gulped
he wants to know if he can't see her
i didn't know what to say
i said i'd see
i didn't knowthe doctor said  the doctor said we 'must keep her peaceful' george said sharply
do you think that man's coming would be very soothing
my god
if it hadn't been for him this mightn't have happened we could have gone on living here quietly andwhy it would be like taking a stranger into her room
she hasn't even spoken of him more than twice in all the time we've been away
doesn't he know how sick she is
you tell him the doctor said she had to be quiet and peaceful
that's what he did say isn't it  fanny acquiesced tearfully
i'll tell him
i'll tell him the doctor said she was to be kept very quiet
ii didn't know and she pottered out
an hour later the nurse appeared in george's doorway she came noiselessly and his back was toward her but he jumped as if he had been shot and his jaw fell he so feared what she was going to say
she wants to see you  the terrified mouth shut with a click and he nodded and followed her but she remained outside his mother's room while he went in
isabel's eyes were closed and she did not open them or move her head but she smiled and edged her hand toward him as he sat on a stool beside the bed
he took that slender cold hand and put it to his cheek
darling did youget something to eat she could only whisper slowly and with difficulty
it was as if isabel herself were far away and only able to signal what she wanted to say
yes mother  all youneeded  yes mother  she did not speak again for a time then are you sure you didn'tdidn't catch cold coming home  i'm all right mother  that's good
it's sweetit's sweet  what is mother darling  to feelmy hand on your cheek
ii can feel it  but this frightened him horriblythat she seemed so glad she could feel it like a child proud of some miraculous seeming thing accomplished
it frightened him so that he could not speak and he feared that she would know how he trembled but she was unaware and again was silent
finally she spoke again  i wonder ifif eugene and lucy know that we've comehome  i'm sure they do  has heasked about me  yes he was here  has hegone  yes mother  she sighed faintly
i'd like  what mother  i'd like to haveseen him it was just audible this little regretful murmur
several minutes passed before there was another
justjust once she whispered and then was still
she seemed to have fallen asleep and george moved to go but a faint pressure upon his fingers detained him and he remained with her hand still pressed against his cheek
after a while he made sure she was asleep and moved again to let the nurse come in and this time there was no pressure of the fingers to keep him
she was not asleep but thinking that if he went he might get some rest and be better prepared for what she knew was coming she commanded those longing fingers of hersand let him go
he found the doctor standing with the nurse in the hall and telling them that his mother was drowsing now george went back to his own room where he was startled to find his grandfather lying on the bed and his uncle leaning against the wall
they had gone home two hours before and he did not know they had returned
the doctor thought we'd better come over amberson said then was silent and george shaking violently sat down on the edge of the bed
his shaking continued and from time to time he wiped heavy sweat from his forehead
the hours passed and sometimes the old man upon the bed would snore a little stop suddenly and move as if to rise but george amberson would set a hand upon his shoulder and murmur a reassuring word or two
now and then either uncle or nephew would tiptoe into the hall and look toward isabel's room then come tiptoeing back the other watching him haggardly
once george gasped defiantly that doctor in new york said she might get better
don't you know he did
don't you know he said she might  amberson made no answer
dawn had been murking through the smoky windows growing stronger for half an hour when both men started violently at a sound in the hall and the major sat up on the bed unchecked
it was the voice of the nurse speaking to fanny minafer and the next moment fanny appeared in the doorway making contorted efforts to speak
amberson said weakly does she want usto come in  but fanny found her voice and uttered a long loud cry
she threw her arms about george and sobbed in an agony of loss and compassion  she loved you she wailed
she loved you
she loved you
oh how she did love you  isabel had just left them
chapter xxx   major amberson remained dryeyed through the time that followed he knew that this separation from his daughter would be short that the separation which had preceded it was the long one
he worked at his ledgers no more under his old gas droplight but would sit all evening staring into the fire in his bedroom and not speaking unless someone asked him a question
he seemed almost unaware of what went on around him and those who were with him thought him dazed by isabel's death guessing that he was lost in reminiscences and vague dreams
probably his mind is full of pictures of his youth or the civil war and the days when he and mother were young married people and all of us children were jolly little thingsand the city was a small town with one cobbled street and the others just dirt roads with board sidewalks this was george amberson's conjecture and the others agreed but they were mistaken
the major was engaged in the profoundest thinking of his life
no business plans which had ever absorbed him could compare in momentousness with the plans that absorbed him now for he had to plan how to enter the unknown country where he was not even sure of being recognized as an ambersonnot sure of anything except that isabel would help him if she could
his absorption produced the outward effect of reverie but of course it was not
the major was occupied with the first really important matter that had taken his attention since he came home invalided after the gettysburg campaign and went into business and he realized that everything which had worried him or delighted him during this lifetime between then and todayall his buying and building and trading and bankingthat it all was trifling and waste beside what concerned him now
he seldom went out of his room and often left untouched the meals they brought to him there and this neglect caused them to shake their heads mournfully again mistaking for dazedness the profound concentration of his mind
meanwhile the life of the little bereft group still forlornly centering upon him began to pick up again as life will and to emerge from its own period of dazedness
it was not isabel's father but her son who was really dazed
a month after her death he walked abruptly into fanny's room one night and found her at her desk eagerly adding columns of figures with which she had covered several sheets of paper
this mathematical computation was concerned with her future income to be produced by the electric headlight now just placed on the general market but fanny was ashamed to be discovered doing anything except mourning and hastily pushed the sheets aside even as she looked over her shoulder to greet her holloweyed visitor
george
you startled me  i beg your pardon for not knocking he said huskily
i didn't think  she turned in her chair and looked at him solicitously
sit down george won't you  no
i just wanted  i could hear you walking up and down in your room said fanny
you were doing it ever since dinner and it seems to me you're at it almost every evening
i don't believe it's good for youand i know it would worry your mother terribly if she fanny hesitated
see here george said breathing fast i want to tell you once more that what i did was right
how could i have done anything else but what i did do  about what george  about everything he exclaimed and he became vehement
i did the right thing i tell you
in heaven's name i'd like to know what else there was for anybody in my position to do
it would have been a dreadful thing for me to just let matters go on and not interfereit would have been terrible
what else on earth was there for me to do
i had to stop that talk didn't i
could a son do less than i did
didn't it cost me something to do it
lucy and i'd had a quarrel but that would have come round in timeand it meant the end forever when i turned her father back from our door
i knew what it meant yet i went ahead and did it because knew it had to be done if the talk was to be stopped
i took mother away for the same reason
i knew that would help to stop it
and she was happy over thereshe was perfectly happy
i tell you i think she had a happy life and that's my only consolation
she didn't live to be old she was still beautiful and young looking and i feel she'd rather have gone before she got old
she'd had a good husband and all the comfort and luxury that anybody could haveand how could it be called anything but a happy life
she was always cheerful and when i think of her i can always see her laughingi can always hear that pretty laugh of hers
when i can keep my mind off of the trip home and that last night i always think of her gay and laughing
so how on earth could she have had anything but a happy life
people that aren't happy don't look cheerful all the time do they
they look unhappy if they are unhappy that's how they look
see herehe faced her challenginglydo you deny that i did the right thing  oh i don't pretend to judge fanny said soothingly for his voice and gesture both partook of wildness
i know you think you did george  think i did he echoed violently
my god in heaven and he began to walk up and down the floor
what else was there to do
what choice did i have
was there any other way of stopping the talk he stopped close in front of her gesticulating his voice harsh and loud don't you hear me
i'm asking you was there any other way on earth of protecting her from the talk  miss fanny looked away
it died down before long i think she said nervously
that shows i was right doesn't it he cried
if i hadn't acted as i did that slanderous old johnson woman would have kept on with her slandersshe'd still be  no fanny interrupted
she's dead
she dropped dead with apoplexy one day about six weeks after you left
i didn't mention it in my letters because i didn't wanti thought  well the other people would have kept on then
they'd have  i don't know said fanny still averting her troubled eyes
things are so changed here george
the other people you speak ofone hardly knows what's become of them
of course not a great many were doing the talking and theywell some of them are dead and some might as well beyou never see them any moreand the rest whoever they were are probably so mixed in with the crowds of new people that seem never even to have heard of usand i'm sure we certainly never heard of themand people seem to forget things so soonthey seem to forget anything
you can't imagine how things have changed here  george gulped painfully before he could speak
youyou mean to sit there and tell me that if i'd just let things go onoh he swung away walking the floor again
i tell you i did the only right thing
if you don't think so why in the name of heaven can't you say what else i should have done
it's easy enough to criticize but the person who criticizes a man ought at least to tell him what else he should have done
you think i was wrong  i'm not saying so she said
you did at the time he cried
you said enough then i think
well what have you to say now if you're so sure i was wrong  nothing george  it's only because you're afraid to he said and he went on with a sudden bitter divination you're reproaching yourself with what you had to do with all that and you're trying to make up for it by doing and saying what you think mother would want you to and you think i couldn't stand it if i got to thinking i might have done differently
oh i know
that's exactly what's in your mind you do think i was wrong
so does uncle george
i challenged him about it the other day and he answered just as you're answeringevaded and tried to be gentler
i don't care to be handled with gloves
i tell you i was right and i don't need any coddling by people that think i wasn't
and i suppose you believe i was wrong not to let morgan see her that last night when he came here and sheshe was dying
if you do why in the name of god did you come and ask me
you could have taken him in
she did want to see him
she  miss fanny looked startled
you think  she told me so and the tortured young man choked
she said'just once'
she said 'i'd like to have seen himjust once'
she meantto tell him goodbye
that's what she meant
and you put this on me too you put this responsibility on me
but i tell you and i told uncle george that the responsibility isn't all mine
if you were so sure i was wrong all the timewhen i took her away and when i turned morgan outif you were so sure what did you let me do it for
you and uncle george were grown people both of you weren't you
you were older than i and if you were so sure you were wiser than i why did you just stand around with your hands hanging down and let me go ahead
you could have stopped it if it was wrong couldn't you  fanny shook her head
no george she said slowly
nobody could have stopped you
you were too strong and  and what he demanded loudly
and she loved youtoo well  george stared at her hard then his lower lip began to move convulsively and he set his teeth upon it but could not check its frantic twitching
he ran out of the room
she sat still listening
he had plunged into his mother's room but no sound came to fanny's ears after the sharp closing of the door and presently she rose and stepped out into the hallbut could hear nothing
the heavy black walnut door of isabel's room as fanny's troubled eyes remained fixed upon it seemed to become darker and vaguer the polished wood took the distant ceiling light at the end of the hall in dim reflections which became mysterious and to fanny's disturbed mind the single sharp point of light on the bronze doorknob was like a continuous sharp cry in the stillness of night
what interview was sealed away from human eye and ear within the lonely darkness on the other side of that doorin that darkness where isabel's own special chairs were and her own special books and the two great walnut wardrobes filled with her dresses and wraps
what tragic argument might be there vainly striving to confute the gentle dead
in god's name what else could i have done for his mother's immutable silence was surely answering him as isabel in life would never have answered him and he was beginning to understand how eloquent the dead can be
they cannot stop their eloquence no matter how they have loved the living they cannot choose
and so no matter in what agony george should cry out what else could i have done and to the end of his life no matter how often he made that wild appeal isabel was doomed to answer him with the wistful faint murmur  i'd like to haveseen him
justjust once  a cheerful darkey went by the house loudly and tunelessly whistling some broken thoughts upon women fried food and gin then a group of high school boys returning homeward after important initiations were heard skylarking along the sidewalk rattling sticks on the fences squawking hoarsely and even attempting to sing in the shocking new voices of uncompleted adolescence
for no reason and just as a poultry yard falls into causeless agitation they stopped in front of the house and for half an hour produced the effect of a noisy multitude in full riot
to the woman standing upstairs in the hall this was almost unbearable and she felt that she would have to go down and call to them to stop but she was too timid and after a time went back to her room and sat at her desk again
she left the door open and frequently glanced out into the hall but gradually became once more absorbed in the figures which represented her prospective income from her great plunge in electric lights for automobiles
she did not hear george return to his own room
a superstitious person might have thought it unfortunate that her partner in this speculative industry as in wilbur's disastrous rollingmills was that charming but too haphazardous man of the world george amberson
he was one of those optimists who believe that if you put money into a great many enterprises one of them is sure to turn out a fortune and therefore in order to find the lucky one it is only necessary to go into a large enough number of them
altogether gallant in spirit and beautifully game under catastrophe he had gone into a great many and the unanimity of their bad luck as he called it gave him one claim to be a distinguished person if he had no other
in business he was ill fated with a consistency which made him in that alone a remarkable man and he declared with some earnestness that there was no accounting for it except by the fact that there had been so much good luck in his family before he was born that something had to balance it
you ought to have thought of my record and stayed out he told fanny one day the next spring when the affairs of the headlight company had begun to look discouraging
i feel the old familiar sinking that's attended all my previous efforts to prove myself a business genius
i think it must be something like the feeling an aeronaut has when his balloon bursts and looking down he sees below him the old home farm where he used to livei mean the feeling he'd have just before he flattened out in that same old clay barnyard
things do look bleak and i'm only glad you didn't go into this confounded thing to the extent i did  miss fanny grew pink
but it must go right she protested
we saw with our own eyes how perfectly it worked in the shop
the light was so bright no one could face it and so there can't be any reason for it not to work
it simply  oh you're right about that amberson said
it certainly was a perfect thingin the shop
the only thing we didn't know was how fast an automobile had to go to keep the light going
it appears that this was a matter of some importance  well how fast does one have to  to keep the light from going entirely out he informed her with elaborate deliberation it is computed by those enthusiasts who have bought our productand subsequently returned it to us and got their money backthey compute that a motor car must maintain a speed of twentyfive miles an hour or else there won't be any light at all
to make the illumination bright enough to be noticed by an approaching automobile they state the speed must be more than thirty miles an hour
at thirtyfive objects in the path of the light begin to become visible at forty they are revealed distinctly and at fifty and above we have a real headlight
unfortunately many people don't care to drive that fast at all times after dusk especially in the traffic or where policemen are likely to become objectionable  but think of that test on the road when we  that test was lovely he admitted
the inventor made us happy with his oratory and you and frank bronson and i went whirling through the night at a speed that thrilled us
it was an intoxicating sensation we were intoxicated by the lights the lights and the music
we must never forget that drive with the cool wind kissing our cheeks and the road lit up for miles ahead
we must never forget it and we never shall
it cost  but something's got to be done  it has indeed
my something would seem to be leaving my watch at my uncle's
luckily you  the pink of fanny's cheeks became deeper
but isn't that man going to do anything to remedy it
can't he try to  he can try said amberson
he is trying in fact
i've sat in the shop watching him try for several beautiful afternoons while outside the windows all nature was fragrant with spring and smoke
he hums ragtime to himself as he tries and i think his mind is wandering to something else less tediousto some new invention in which he'd take more interest  but you mustn't let him she cried
you must make him keep on trying  oh yes
he understands that's what i sit there for
i'll keep sitting  however in spite of the time he spent sitting in the shop worrying the inventor of the fractious light amberson found opportunity to worry himself about another matter of business
this was the settlement of isabel's estate
it's curious about the deed to her house he said to his nephew
you're absolutely sure it wasn't among her papers  mother didn't have any papers george told him
none at all
all she ever had to do with business was to deposit the cheques grandfather gave her and then write her own cheques against them  the deed to the house was never recorded amberson said thoughtfully
i've been over to the courthouse to see
i asked father if he never gave her one and he didn't seem able to understand me at first
then he finally said he thought he must have given her a deed long ago but he wasn't sure
i rather think he never did
i think it would be just as well to get him to execute one now in your favour
i'll speak to him about it  george sighed
i don't think i'd bother him about it the house is mine and you and i understand that it is
that's enough for me and there isn't likely to be much trouble between you and me when we come to settling poor grandfather's estate
i've just been with him and i think it would only confuse him for you to speak to him about it again
i notice he seems distressed if anybody tries to get his attentionhe's a long way off somewhere and he likes to stay that way
i thinki think mother wouldn't want us to bother him about it i'm sure she'd tell us to let him alone
he looks so white and queer  amberson shook his head
not much whiter and queerer than you do young fellow
you'd better begin to get some air and exercise and quit hanging about in the house all day
i won't bother him any more than i can help but i'll have the deed made out ready for his signature  i wouldn't bother him at all
i don't see  you might see said his uncle uneasily
the estate is just about as involved and mixedup as an estate can well get to the best of my knowledge and i haven't helped it any by what he let me have for this infernal headlight scheme which has finally gone trolloping forever to where the woodbine twineth
leaves me flat and poor old frank bronson just half flat and fannywell thank heaven
i kept her from going in so deep that it would leave her flat
it's rough on her as it is i suspect
you ought to have that deed  no
don't bother him  i'll bother him as little as possible
i'll wait till some day when he seems to brighten up a little  but amberson waited too long
the major had already taken eleven months since his daughter's death to think important things out
he had got as far with them as he could and there was nothing to detain him longer in the world
one evening his grandson sat with himthe major seemed to like best to have young george with him so far as they were able to guess his preferencesand the old gentleman made a queer gesture he slapped his knee as if he had made a sudden discovery or else remembered that he had forgotten something
george looked at him with an air of inquiry but said nothing
he had grown to be almost as silent as his grandfather
however the major spoke without being questioned
it must be in the sun he said
there wasn't anything here but the sun in the first place and the earth came out of the sun and we came out of the earth
so whatever we are we must have been in the sun
we go back to the earth we came out of so the earth will go back to the sun that it came out of
and time means nothingnothing at allso in a little while we'll all be back in the sun together
i wish  he moved his hand uncertainly as if reaching for something and george jumped up
did you want anything grandfather  what  would you like a glass of water  nono
no i don't want anything the reaching hand dropped back upon the arm of his chair and he relapsed into silence but a few minutes later he finished the sentence he had begun  i wishsomebody could tell me  the next day he had a slight cold but he seemed annoyed when his son suggested calling the doctor and amberson let him have his own way so far in fact that after he had got up and dressed the following morning he was all alone when he went away to find out what he hadn't been able to think outall those things he had wished somebody would tell him
old sam shuffling in with the breakfast tray found the major in his accustomed easychair by the fireplaceand yet even the old darkey could see instantly that the major was not there
chapter xxxi    when the great amberson estate went into court for settlement there wasn't any george amberson saidthat is when the settlement was concluded there was no estate
i guessed it amberson went on
as an expert on prosperity my career is disreputable but as a prophet of calamity i deserve a testimonial banquet he reproached himself bitterly for not having long ago discovered that his father had never given isabel a deed to her house
and those pigs sydney and amelia  he added for this was another thing he was bitter about
they won't do anything
i'm sorry i gave them the opportunity of making a polished refusal
amelia's letter was about half in italian she couldn't remember enough ways of saying no in english
one has to live quite a long while to realize there are people like that
the estate was badly crippled even before they took out their 'third' and the 'third' they took was the only good part of the rotten apple
well i didn't ask them for restitution on my own account and at least it will save you some trouble young george
never waste any time writing to them you mustn't count on them  i don't george said quietly
i don't count on anything  oh we'll not feel that things are quite desperate amberson laughed but not with great cheerfulness
we'll survive georgieyou will especially
for my part i'm a little too old and too accustomed to fall back on somebody else for supplies to start a big fight with life i'll be content with just surviving and i can do it on an eighteenhundreddollarayear consulship
an excongressman can always be pretty sure of getting some such job and i hear from washington the matter's about settled
i'll live pleasantly enough with a pitcher of ice under a palm tree and black folks to wait on methat part of it will be like homeand i'll manage to send you fifty dollars every now and then after i once get settled
so much for me
but youof course you've had a poor training for making your own way but you're only a boy after all and the stuff of the old stock is in you
it'll come out and do something
i'll never forgive myself about that deed it would have given you something substantial to start with
still you have a little tiny bit and you'll have a little tiny salary too and of course your aunt fanny's here and she's got something you can fall back on if you get too pinched until i can begin to send you a dribble now and then  george's little tiny bit was six hundred dollars which had come to him from the sale of his mother's furniture and the little tiny salary  was eight dollars a week which old frank bronson was to pay him for services as a clerk and studentatlaw
old frank would have offered more to the major's grandson but since the death of that best of clients and his own experience with automobile headlights he was not certain of being able to pay more and at the same time settle his own small bills for board and lodging
george had accepted haughtily and thereby removed a burden from his uncle's mind
amberson himself however had not even a tiny bit though he got his consular appointment and to take him to his post he found it necessary to borrow two hundred of his nephew's six hundred dollars
it makes me sick george he said
but i'd better get there and get that salary started
of course eugene would do anything in the world and the fact is he wanted to but i felt thatahunder the circumstances  never george exclaimed growing red
i can't imagine one of the family he paused not finding it necessary to explain that the family shouldn't turn a man from the door and then accept favours from him
i wish you'd take more  amberson declined
one thing i'll say for you young george you haven't a stingy bone in your body
that's the amberson stock in youand i like it  he added something to this praise of his nephew on the day he left for washington
he was not to return but to set forth from the capital on the long journey to his post
george went with him to the station and their farewell was lengthened by the train's being several minutes late
i may not see you again georgie amberson said and his voice was a little husky as he set a kind hand on the young man's shoulder
it's quite probable that from this time on we'll only know each other by letteruntil you're notified as my next of kin that there's an old valise to be forwarded to you and perhaps some dusty curios from the consulate mantelpiece
well it's an odd way for us to be saying goodbye one wouldn't have thought it even a few years ago but here we are two gentlemen of elegant appearance in a state of bustitude
we can't ever tell what will happen at all can we
once i stood where we're standing now to say goodbye to a pretty girlonly it was in the old station before this was built and we called it the 'depot'
she'd been visiting your mother before isabel was married and i was wild about her and she admitted she didn't mind that
in fact we decided we couldn't live without each other and we were to be married
but she had to go abroad first with her father and when we came to say goodbye we knew we wouldn't see each other again for almost a year
i thought i couldn't live through itand she stood here crying
well i don't even know where she lives now or if she is livingand i only happen to think of her sometimes when i'm here at the station waiting for a train
if she ever thinks of me she probably imagines i'm still dancing in the ballroom at the amberson mansion and she probably thinks of the mansion as still beautifulstill the finest house in town
life and money both behave like loose quicksilver in a nest of cracks
and when they're gone we can't tell whereor what the devil we did with 'em
but i believe i'll say nowwhile there isn't much time left for either of us to get embarrassed about iti believe i'll say that i've always been fond of you georgie but i can't say that i always liked you
sometimes i've felt you were distinctly not an acquired taste
until lately one had to be fond of you just naturallythis isn't very 'tactful' of coursefor if he didn't well he wouldn't
we all spoiled you terribly when you were a little boy and let you grow up en princeand i must say you took to it
but you've received a pretty heavy jolt and i had enough of your disposition myself at your age to understand a little of what cocksure youth has to go through inside when it finds that it can make terrible mistakes
poor old fellow
you get both kinds of jolts together spiritual and materialand you've taken them pretty quietly andwell with my train coming into the shed you'll forgive me for saying that there have been times when i thought you ought to be hangedbut i've always been fond of you and now i like you
and just for a last word there may be somebody else in this town who's always felt about you like thatfond of you i mean no matter how much it seemed you ought to be hanged
you might tryhello i must run
i'll send back the money as fast as they pay meso goodbye and god bless you georgie  he passed through the gates waved his hat cheerily from the other side of the iron screen and was lost from sight in the hurrying crowd
and as he disappeared an unexpected poignant loneliness fell upon his nephew so heavily and so suddenly that he had no energy to recoil from the shock
it seemed to him that the last fragment of his familiar world had disappeared leaving him all alone forever
he walked homeward slowly through what appeared to be the strange streets of a strange city and as a matter of fact the city was strange to him
he had seen little of it during his years in college and then had followed the long absence and his tragic return
since that he had been scarcely outdoors at all as fanny complained warning him that his health would suffer and he had been downtown only in a closed carriage
he had not realized the great change
the streets were thunderous a vast energy heaved under the universal coating of dinginess
george walked through the begrimed crowds of hurrying strangers and saw no face that he remembered
great numbers of the faces were even of a kind he did not remember ever to have seen they were partly like the old type that his boyhood knew and partly like types he knew abroad
he saw german eyes with american wrinkles at their corners he saw irish eyes and neapolitan eyes roman eyes tuscan eyes eyes of lombardy of savoy hungarian eyes balkan eyes scandinavian eyesall with a queer american look in them
he saw jews who had been german jews jews who had been russian jews jews who had been polish jews but were no longer german or russian or polish jews
all the people were soiled by the smokemist through which they hurried under the heavy sky that hung close upon the new skyscrapers and nearly all seemed harried by something impending though here and there a women with bundles would be laughing to a companion about some adventure of the department stores or perhaps an escape from the charging traffic of the streetsand not infrequently a girl or a freeandeasy young matron found time to throw an encouraging look to george
he took no note of these and leaving the crowded sidewalks turned north into national avenue and presently reached the quieter but no less begrimed region of smaller shops and oldfashioned houses
those latter had been the homes of his boyhood playmates old friends of his grandfather had lived herein this alley he had fought with two boys at the same time and whipped them in that front yard he had been successfully teased into temporary insanity by a sundayschool class of pinky little girls
on that sagging porch a laughing woman had fed him and other boys with doughnuts and gingerbread yonder he saw the staggered relics of the iron picket fence he had made his white pony jump on a dare and in the shabby stonefaced house behind the fence he had gone to children's parties and when he was a little older he had danced there often and fallen in love with mary sharon and kissed her apparently by force under the stairs in the hall
the double front doors of meaninglessly carved walnut once so glossily varnished had been painted smoke gray but the smoke grime showed repulsively even on the smoke gray and over the doors a smoked sign proclaimed the place to be a stag hotel  other houses had become boardinghouses too genteel for signs but many were franker some offering board by the day week or meal and some more laconic contenting themselves with the label rooms one having torn out part of an old stonetrimmed bay window for purposes of commercial display showed forth two suspended petticoats and a pair of oystercoloured flannel trousers to prove the claims of its blackandgilt sign french cleaning and dye house its next neighbour also sported a remodelled front and permitted no doubt that its mission in life was to attend cosily upon death j
m rolsener
caskets
the funeral home and beyond that a plain old honest foursquare graypainted brick house was flamboyantly decorated with a great gilt scroll on the railing of the oldfashioned veranda mutual benev't order cavaliers and dames of purity this was the old minafer house
george passed it without perceptibly wincing in fact he held his head up and except for his gravity of countenance and the prison pallor he had acquired by too constantly remaining indoors there was little to warn an acquaintance that he was not precisely the same george amberson minafer known aforetime
he was still so magnificent indeed that there came to his ears a waft of comment from a passing automobile
this was a fearsome red car glittering in brass with halfadozen young people in it whose motorism had reached an extreme manifestation in dress
the ladies of this party were favourably affected at sight of the pedestrian upon the sidewalk and as the machine was moving slowly and close to the curb they had time to observe him in detail which they did with a frankness not pleasing to the object of their attentions
one sees so many nicelooking people one doesn't know nowadays said the youngest of the young ladies
this old town of ours is really getting enormous
i shouldn't mind knowing who he is  i don't know the youth beside her said loudly enough to be heard at a considerable distance
i don't know who he is but from his looks i know who he thinks he is he thinks he's the grand duke cuthbert there was a burst of tittering as the car gathered speed and rolled away with the girl continuing to look back until her scandalized companions forced her to turn by pulling her hood over her face
she made an impression upon george so deep a one in fact that he unconsciously put his emotion into a muttered word  riffraff
this was the last walk home he was ever to take by the route he was now following up national avenue to amberson addition and the two big old houses at the foot of amberson boulevard for tonight would be the last night that he and fanny were to spend in the house which the major had forgotten to deed to isabel
tomorrow they were to move out and george was to begin his work in bronson's office
he had not come to this collapse without a fierce strugglebut the struggle was inward and the rolling world was not agitated by it and rolled calmly on
for of all the ideals of life which the world in its rolling inconsiderately flattens out to nothingness the least likely to retain a profile is that ideal which depends upon inheriting money
george amberson in spite of his record of failures in business had spoken shrewdly when he realized at last that money like life was like quicksilver in a nest of cracks and his nephew had the awakening experience of seeing the great amberson estate vanishing into such a nestin a twinkling it seemed now that it was indeed so utterly vanished
his uncle had suggested that he might write to college friends perhaps they could help him to something better than the prospect offered by bronson's office but george flushed and shook his head without explaining
in that small and quietly superior crowd of his he had too emphatically supported the ideal of being rather than doing
he could not appeal to one of its members now to help him to a job
besides they were not precisely the warmesthearted crew in the world and he had long ago dropped the last affectation of a correspondence with any of them
he was as aloof from any survival of intimacy with his boyhood friends in the city and in truth had lost track of most of them
the friends of the ace once bound by oath to succour one another in peril or poverty were long ago dispersed one or two had died one or two had gone to live elsewhere the others were disappeared into the smoky bigness of the heavy city
of the brethren there remained within his present cognizance only his old enemy the redhaired kinney now married to janie sharon and charlie johnson who out of deference to his mother's memory had passed the amberson mansion one day when george stood upon the front steps and looking in fiercely had looked away with continued fiercenesshis only token of recognition
on this last homeward walk of his when george reached the entrance to amberson additionthat is when he came to where the entrance had formerly beenhe gave a little start and halted for a moment to stare
this was the first time he had noticed that the stone pillars marking the entrance had been removed
then he realized that for a long time he had been conscious of a queerness about this corner without being aware of what made the difference
national avenue met amberson boulevard here at an obtuse angle and the removal of the pillars made the boulevard seem a crossstreet of no overpowering importancecertainly it did not seem to be a boulevard
at the next corner neptune's fountain remained and one could still determine with accuracy what its designer's intentions had been
it stood in sore need of just one last kindness and if the thing had possessed any friends they would have done that doleful shovelling after dark
george did not let his eyes linger upon the relic nor did he look steadfastly at the amberson mansion
massive as the old house was it managed to look gaunt its windows stared with the skull emptiness of all windows in empty houses that are to be lived in no more
of course the rowdy boys of the neighbourhood had been at work many of these haggard windows were broken the front door stood ajar forced open and idiot salacity in white chalk was smeared everywhere upon the pillars and stonework of the verandas
george walked by the mansion hurriedly and came home to his mother's house for the last time
emptiness was there too and the closing of the door resounded through bare rooms for downstairs there was no furniture in the house except a kitchen table in the dining room which fanny had kept for dinner she said though as she was to cook and serve that meal herself george had his doubts about her name for it
upstairs she had retained her own furniture and george had been living in his mother's room having sent everything from his own to the auction
isabel's room was still as it had been but the furniture would be moved with fanny's to new quarters in the morning
fanny had made plans for her nephew as well as herself she had found a threeroom kitchenette apartment in an apartment house where several old friends of hers had established themselveselderly widows of citizens once prominent and other retired gentry
people used their own kitchenettes for breakfast and lunch but there was a tabled'hote arrangement for dinner on the ground floor and after dinner bridge was played all evening an attraction powerful with fanny
she had made all the arrangements she reported and nervously appealed for approval asking if she hadn't shown herself pretty practical in such matters
george acquiesced absentmindedly not thinking of what she said and not realizing to what it committed him
he began to realize it now as he wandered about the dismantled house he was far from sure that he was willing to go and live in a threeroom apartment with fanny and eat breakfast and lunch with her prepared by herself in the kitchenette and dinner at the table d'hote in such a pretty colonial dining room so fanny described it at a little round table they would have all to themselves in the midst of a dozen little round tables which other relics of disrupted families would have all to themselves
for the first time now that the change was imminent george began to develop before his mind's eye pictures of what he was in for and they appalled him
he decided that such a life verged upon the sheerly unbearable and that after all there were some things left that he just couldn't stand
so he made up his mind to speak to his aunt about it at dinner and tell her that he preferred to ask bronson to let him put a sofabed a trunk and a folding rubber bathtub behind a screen in the dark rear room of the office
george felt that this would be infinitely more tolerable and he could eat at restaurants especially as about all he ever wanted nowadays was coffee
but at dinner he decided to put off telling fanny of his plan until later she was so nervous and so distressed about the failure of her efforts with sweetbreads and macaroni and she was so eager in her talk of how comfortable they would be by this time tomorrow night she fluttered on her nervousness increasing saying how nice it would be for him when he came from work in the evenings to be among nice peoplepeople who know who we are and to have a pleasant game of bridge with people who are really old friends of the family  when they stopped probing among the scorched fragments she had set forth george lingered downstairs waiting for a better opportunity to introduce his own subject but when he heard dismaying sounds from the kitchen he gave up
there was a crash then a shower of crashes falling tin clamoured to be heard above the shattering of porcelain and over all rose fanny's wail of lamentation for the treasures saved from the sale but now lost forever to the kitchenette fanny was nervous indeed so nervous that she could not trust her hands
for a moment george thought she might have been injured but before he reached the kitchen he heard her sweeping at the fragments and turned back
he put off speaking to fanny until morning
things more insistent than his vague plans for a sofabed in bronson's office had possession of his mind as he went upstairs moving his hand slowly along the smooth walnut railing of the balustrade
half way to the landing he stopped turned and stood looking down at the heavy doors masking the black emptiness that had been the library
here he had stood on what he now knew was the worst day of his life here he had stood when his mother passed through that doorway handinhand with her brother to learn what her son had done
he went on more heavily more slowly and more heavily and slowly still entered isabel's room and shut the door
he did not come forth again and bade fanny goodnight through the closed door when she stopped outside it later
i've put all the lights out george she said
everything's all right  very well he called
goodnight  she did not go
i'm sure we're going to enjoy the new little home george she said timidly
i'll try hard to make things nice for you and the people really are lovely
you mustn't feel as if things are altogether gloomy george
i know everything's going to turn out all right
you're young and strong and you have a good mind and i'm sure  she hesitatedi'm sure your mother's watching over you georgie
goodnight dear  goodnight aunt fanny  his voice had a strangled sound in spite of him but she seemed not to notice it and he heard her go to her own room and lock herself in with bolt and key against burglars
she had said the one thing she should not have said just then i'm sure your mother's watching over you georgie she had meant to be kind but it destroyed his last chance for sleep that night
he would have slept little if she had not said it but since she had said it he could not sleep at all
for he knew that it was trueif it could be trueand that his mother if she still lived in spirit would be weeping on the other side of the wall of silence weeping and seeking for some gate to let her through so that she could come and watch over him  he felt that if there were such gates they were surely barred they were like those awful library doors downstairs which had shut her in to begin the suffering to which he had consigned her
the room was still isabel's
nothing had been changed even the photographs of george of the major and of brother george still stood on her dressingtable and in a drawer of her desk was an old picture of eugene and lucy taken together which george had found but had slowly closed away again from sight not touching it
tomorrow everything would be gone and he had heard there was not long to wait before the house itself would be demolished
the very space which tonight was still isabel's room would be cut into new shapes by new walls and floors and ceilings yet the room would always live for it could not die out of george's memory
it would live as long as he did and it would always be murmurous with a tragic wistful whispering
and if space itself can be haunted as memory is haunted then some time when the space that was isabel's room came to be made into the small bedrooms and kitchenettes already designed as its destiny that space might well be haunted and the new occupants come to feel that some seemingly causeless depression hung about ita wraith of the passion that filled it throughout the last night that george minafer spent there
whatever remnants of the old highhanded arrogance were still within him he did penance for his deepest sin that nightand it may be that to this day some impressionable overworked woman in a kitchenette  after turning out the light will seem to see a young man kneeling in the darkness shaking convulsively and with arms outstretched through the wall clutching at the covers of a shadowy bed
it may seem to her that she hears the faint cry over and over  mother forgive me
god forgive me     chapter xxxii    at least it may be claimed for george that his last night in the house where he had been born was not occupied with his own disheartening future but with sorrow for what sacrifices his pride and youth had demanded of others
and early in the morning he came downstairs and tried to help fanny make coffee on the kitchen range
there was something i wanted to say to you last night aunt fanny he said as she finally discovered that an amber fluid more like tea than coffee was as near ready to be taken into the human system as it would ever be
i think i'd better do it now  she set the coffeepot back upon the stove with a little crash and looking at him in a desperate anxiety began to twist her dainty apron between her fingers without any consciousness of what she was doing
whywhy she stammered but she knew what he was going to say and that was why she had been more and more nervous
hadn'tperhapsperhaps we'd better get thethe things moved to the little new home first george
let's  he interrupted quietly though at her phrase the little new home his pungent impulse was to utter one loud shout and run
it was about this new place that i wanted to speak
i've been thinking it over and i've decided
i want you to take all the things from mother's room and use them and keep them for me and i'm sure the little apartment will be just what you like and with the extra bedroom probably you could find some woman friend to come and live there and share the expense with you
but i've decided on another arrangement for myself and so i'm not going with you
i don't suppose you'll mind much and i don't see why you should mindparticularly that is
i'm not very lively company these days or any days for that matter
i can't imagine you or any one else being much attached to me so  he stopped in amazement no chair had been left in the kitchen but fanny gave a despairing glance around her in search of one then sank abruptly and sat flat upon the floor
you're going to leave me in the lurch she gasped
what on earth george sprang to her
get up aunt fanny  i can't
i'm too weak
let me alone george and as he released the wrist he had seized to help her she repeated the dismal prophecy which for days she had been matching against her hopes you're going to leave mein the lurch  why no aunt fanny he protested
at first i'd have been something of a burden on you
i'm to get eight dollars a week about thirtytwo a month
the rent's thirtysix dollars a month and the tabled'hote dinner runs up to over twentytwo dollars apiece so with my half of the renteighteen dollarsi'd have less than nothing left out of my salary to pay my share of the groceries for all the breakfasts and luncheons
you see you'd not only be doing all the housework and cooking but you'd be paying more of the expenses than i would  she stared at him with such a forlorn blankness as he had never seen
i'd be paying she said feebly
i'd be paying  certainly you would
you'd be using more of your money than  my money fanny's chin drooped upon her thin chest and she laughed miserably
i've got twentyeight dollars
that's all  you mean until the interest is due again  i mean that's all fanny said
i mean that's all there is
there won't be any more interest because there isn't any principal  why you told  she shook her head
no i haven't told you anything  then it was uncle george
he told me you had enough to fall back on
that's just what he said 'to fall back on'
he said you'd lost more than you should in the headlight company but he'd insisted that you should hold out enough to live on and you'd very wisely followed his advice  i know she said weakly
i told him so
he didn't know or else he'd forgotten how much wilbur's insurance amounted to and ioh it seemed such a sure way to make a real fortune out of a littleand i thought i could do something for you george if you ever came to need itand it all looked so bright i just thought i'd put it all in
i didevery cent except my last interest paymentand it's gone  good lord george began to pace up and down on the worn planks of the bare floor
why on earth did you wait till now to tell such a thing as this  i couldn't tell till i had to she said piteously
i couldn't till george amberson went away
he couldn't do anything to help anyhow and i just didn't want him to talk to me about ithe's been at me so much about not putting more in than i could afford to lose and said he considered he had mymy word i wasn't putting more than that in it
so i thought what was the use
what was the use of going over it all with him and having him reproach me and probably reproach himself
it wouldn't do any goodnot any good on earth she got out her lace handkerchief and began to cry
nothing does any good i guess in this old world
oh how tired of this old world i am
i didn't know what to do
i just tried to go ahead and be as practical as i could and arrange some way for us to live
oh i knew you didn't want me george
you always teased me and berated me whenever you had a chance from the time you were a little boyyou did so
later you've tried to be kinder to me but you don't want me aroundoh i can see that much
you don't suppose i want to thrust myself on you do you
it isn't very pleasant to be thrusting yourself on a person you know doesn't want youbut i knew you oughtn't to be left all alone in the world it isn't good
i knew your mother'd want me to watch over you and try to have something like a home for youi know she'd want me to do what i tried to do  fanny's tears were bitter now and her voice hoarse and wet was tragically sincere
i triedi tried to be practicalto look after your intereststo make things as nice for you as i couldi walked my heels down looking for a place for us to livei walked and walked over this towni didn't ride one block on a streetcari wouldn't use five cents no matter how tired ioh she sobbed uncontrollably
oh
and nowyou don't wantyou wantyou want to leave me in the lurch
you  george stopped walking
in god's name aunt fanny he said quit spreading out your handkerchief and drying it and then getting it all wet again
i mean stop crying
do
and for heaven's sake get up
don't sit there with your back against the boiler and  it's not hot fanny sniffled
it's cold the plumbers disconnected it
i wouldn't mind if they hadn't
i wouldn't mind if it burned me george  oh my lord he went to her and lifted her
for god's sake get up
come let's take the coffee into the other room and see what's to be done  he got her to her feet she leaned upon him already somewhat comforted and with his arm about her he conducted her to the dining room and seated her in one of the two kitchen chairs which had been placed at the rough table
there he said get over it then he brought the coffeepot some lumps of sugar in a tin pan and finding that all the coffeecups were broken set water glasses upon the table and poured some of the pale coffee into them
by this time fanny's spirits had revived appreciably she looked up with a plaintive eagerness
i had bought all my fall clothes george she said and i paid every bill i owed
i don't owe a cent for clothes george  that's good he said wanly and he had a moment of physical dizziness that decided him to sit down quickly
for an instant it seemed to him that he was not fanny's nephew but married to her
he passed his pale hand over his paler forehead
well let's see where we stand he said feebly
let's see if we can afford this place you've selected  fanny continued to brighten
i'm sure it's the most practical plan we could possibly have worked out georgeand it is a comfort to be among nice people
i think we'll both enjoy it because the truth is we've been keeping too much to ourselves for a long while
it isn't good for people  i was thinking about the money aunt fanny
you see  i'm sure we can manage it she interrupted quickly
there really isn't a cheaper place in town that we could actually live in and be  here she interrupted herself
oh
there's one great economy i forgot to tell you and it's especially an economy for you because you're always too generous about such things they don't allow any tipping
they have signs that prohibit it  that's good he said grimly
but the rent is thirtysix dollars a month the dinner is twentytwo and a half for each of us and we've got to have some provision for other food
we won't need any clothes for a year perhaps  oh longer she exclaimed
so you see  i see that fortyfive and thirtysix make eightyone he said
at the lowest we need a hundred dollars a monthand i'm going to make thirtytwo  i thought of that george she said confidently and i'm sure it will be all right
you'll be earning a great deal more than that very soon  i don't see any prospect of itnot till i'm admitted to the bar and that will be two years at the earliest  fanny's confidence was not shaken
i know you'll be getting on faster than  faster george echoed gravely
we've got to have more than that to start with  well there's the six hundred dollars from the sale
six hundred and twelve dollars it was  it isn't six hundred and twelve now said george
it's about one hundred and sixty  fanny showed a momentary dismay
why how  i lent uncle george two hundred i gave fifty apiece to old sam and those two other old darkies that worked for grandfather so long and ten to each of the servants here  and you gave me thirtysix she said thoughtfully for the first month's rent in advance  did i
i'd forgotten
well with about a hundred and sixty in bank and our expenses a hundred a month it doesn't seem as if this new place  still she interrupted we have paid the first month's rent in advance and it does seem to be the most practical  george rose
see here aunt fanny he said decisively
you stay here and look after the moving
old frank doesn't expect me until afternoon this first day but i'll go and see him now  it was early and old frank just established at his big flattopped desk was surprised when his prospective assistant and pupil walked in
he was pleased as well as surprised however and rose offering a cordial old hand
the real flare he said
the real flare for the law
that's right
couldn't wait till afternoon to begin
i'm delighted that you  i wanted to say george began but his patron cut him off
wait just a minute my boy
i've prepared a little speech of welcome and even though you're five hours ahead of time i mean to deliver it
first of all your grandfather was my old warcomrade and my best client for years i prospered through my connection with his business and his grandson is welcome in my office and to my best efforts in his behalf
but i want to confess georgie that during your earlier youth i may have had some slight feeling ofwell prejudice not altogether in your favour but whatever slight feeling it was it began to vanish on that afternoon a good while ago when you stood up to your aunt amelia amberson as you did in the major's library and talked to her as a man and a gentleman should
i saw then what good stuff was in youand i always wanted to mention it
if my prejudice hadn't altogether vanished after that the last vestiges disappeared during these trying times that have come upon you this past year when i have been a witness to the depth of feeling you've shown and your quiet consideration for your grandfather and for everyone else around you
i just want to add that i think you'll find an honest pleasure now in industry and frugality that wouldn't have come to you in a more frivolous career
the law is a jealous mistress and a stern mistress but a  george had stood before him in great and increasing embarrassment and he was unable to allow the address to proceed to its conclusion
i can't do it he burst out
i can't take her for my mistress  what  i've come to tell you i've got to find something that's quicker
i can't  old frank got a little red
let's sit down he said
what's the trouble  george told him
the old gentleman listened sympathetically only murmuring well well from time to time and nodding acquiescence
you see she's set her mind on this apartment george explained
she's got some old cronies there and i guess she's been looking forward to the games of bridge and the kind of harmless gossip that goes on in such places
really it's a life she'd like better than anything elsebetter than that she's lived at home i really believe
it struck me she's just about got to have it and after all she could hardly have anything less  this comes pretty heavily upon me you know said old frank
i got her into that headlight company and she fooled me about her resources as much as she did your uncle george
i was never your father's adviser if you remember and when the insurance was turned over to her some other lawyer arranged itprobably your father's
but it comes pretty heavily on me and i feel a certain responsibility  not at all
i'm taking the responsibility  and george smiled with one corner of his mouth
she's not your aunt you know sir  well i'm unable to see even if she's yours that a young man is morally called upon to give up a career at the law to provide his aunt with a favourable opportunity to play bridge whist  no george agreed
but i haven't begun my 'career at the law' so it can't be said i'm making any considerable sacrifice
i'll tell you how it is sir he flushed and looking out of the streaked and smoky window beside which he was sitting spoke with difficulty
i feel as ifas if perhaps i had one or two pretty important things in my life to make up for
well i can't
i can't make them up toto whom i would
it's struck me that as i couldn't i might be a little decent to somebody else perhapsif i could manage it
i never have been particularly decent to poor old aunt fanny  oh i don't know i shouldn't say that
a little youthful teasingi doubt if she's minded so much
she felt your father's death terrifically of course but it seems to me she's had a fairly comfortable lifeup to nowif she was disposed to take it that way  but 'up to now' is the important thing george said
now is nowand you see i can't wait two years to be admitted to the bar and begin to practice
i've got to start in at something else that pays from the start and that's what i've come to you about
i have an idea you see  well i'm glad of that said old frank smiling
i can't think of anything just at this minute that pays from the start  i only know of one thing myself  what is it  george flushed again but managed to laugh at his own embarrassment
i suppose i'm about as ignorant of business as anybody in the world he said
but i've heard they pay very high wages to people in dangerous trades i've always heard they did and i'm sure it must be true
i mean people that handle touchy chemicals or high explosivesmen in dynamite factories or who take things of that sort about the country in wagons and shoot oil wells
i thought i'd see if you couldn't tell me something more about it or else introduce me to someone who could and then i thought i'd see if i couldn't get something of the kind to do as soon as possible
my nerves are good i'm muscular and i've got a steady hand it seemed to me that this was about the only line of work in the world that i'm fitted for
i wanted to get started today if i could  old frank gave him a long stare
at first this scrutiny was sharply incredulous then it was grave finally it developed into a threat of overwhelming laughter a forked vein in his forehead became more visible and his eyes seemed about to protrude
but he controlled his impulse and rising took up his hat and overcoat
all right he said
if you'll promise not to get blown up i'll go with you to see if we can find the job then meaning what he said but amazed that he did mean it he added you certainly are the most practical young man i ever met     chapter xxxiii   they found the job
it needed an apprenticeship of only six weeks during which period george was to receive fifteen dollars a week after that he would get twentyeight
this settled the apartment question and fanny was presently established in a greater contentment than she had known for a long time
early every morning she made something she called and believed to be coffee for george and he was gallant enough not to undeceive her
she lunched alone in her kitchenette for george's place of employment was ten miles out of town on an interurban trolleyline and he seldom returned before seven
fanny found partners for bridge by two o'clock almost every afternoon and she played until about six
then she got george's dinner clothes out for himhe maintained this habitand she changed her own dress
when he arrived he usually denied that he was tired though he sometimes looked tired particularly during the first few months and he explained to her frequentlylooking bored enough with her insistencethat his work was fairly light and fairly congenial too fanny had the foggiest idea of what it was though she noticed that it roughened his hands and stained them
something in those new chemical works she explained to casual inquirers
it was not more definite in her own mind
respect for george undoubtedly increased within her however and she told him she'd always had a feeling he might turn out to be a mechanical genius or something george assented with a nod as the easiest course open to him
he did not take a hand at bridge after dinner his provisions' for fanny's happiness refused to extend that far and at the table d'hote he was a rather discouraging boarder
he was considered affected and absurdly upstage by the one or two young men and the three or four young women who enlivened the elderly retreat and was possibly less popular there than he had been elsewhere during his life though he was now nothing worse than a coldly polite young man who kept to himself
after dinner he would escort his aunt from the table in some state not wholly unaccompanied by a leerish wink or two from the wags of the place and he would leave her at the door of the communal parlours and card rooms with a formality in his bow of farewell which afforded an amusing contrast to fanny's always voluble protests
she never failed to urge loudly that he really must come and play just this once and not go hiding from everybody in his room every evening like this
at least some of the other inhabitants found the contrast amusing for sometimes as he departed stiffly toward the elevator leaving her still entreating in the doorway though with one eye already on her table to see that it was not seized a titter would follow him which he was no doubt meant to hear
he did not care whether they laughed or not
and once as he passed the one or two young men of the place entertaining the three or four young women who were elbowing and jerking on a settee in the lobby he heard a voice inquiring quickly as he passed  what makes people tired  work  no  well what's the answer  then with an intentional outbreak of mirth the answer was given by two loudly whispering voices together  a stuckup boarder  george didn't care
on sunday mornings fanny went to church and george took long walks
he explored the new city and found it hideous especially in the early spring before the leaves of the shade trees were out
then the town was fagged with the long winter and blacked with the heavier smoke that had been held close to the earth by the smokefog it bred
everything was damply streaked with the soot the walls of the houses inside and out the gray curtains at the windows the windows themselves the dirty cement and unswept asphalt underfoot the very sky overhead
throughout this murky season he continued his explorations never seeing a face he knewfor on sunday those whom he remembered or who might remember him were not apt to be found within the limits of the town but were congenially occupied with the new outdoor life which had come to be the mode since his boyhood
he and fanny were pretty thoroughly buried away within the bigness of the city
one of his sunday walks that spring he made into a sour pilgrimage
it was a misty morning of belated snow slush and suited him to a perfection of miserableness as he stood before the great dripping department store which now occupied the big plot of ground where once had stood both the amberson hotel and the amberson opera house
from there he drifted to the old amberson block but this was fallen into a backwater business had stagnated here
the old structure had not been replaced but a cavernous entryway for trucks had been torn in its front and upon the cornice where the old separate metal letters had spelt amberson block there was a long billboard sign doogan storage  to spare himself nothing he went out national avenue and saw the piles of slushcovered wreckage where the mansion and his mother's house had been and where the major's illfated five new houses had stood for these were down too to make room for the great tenement already shaped in unending lines of foundation
but the fountain of neptune was gone at lastand george was glad that it was
he turned away from the devastated site thinking bitterly that the only amberson mark still left upon the town was the name of the boulevardamberson boulevard
but he had reckoned without the city council of the new order and by an unpleasant coincidence while the thought was still in his mind his eye fell upon a metal oblong sign upon the lamppost at the corner
there were two of these little signs upon the lamppost at an obtuse angle to each other one to give passersby the name of national avenue the other to acquaint them with amberson boulevard
but the one upon which should have been stenciled amberson boulevard exhibited the words tenth street  george stared at it hard
then he walked quickly along the boulevard to the next corner and looked at the little sign there
tenth street  it had begun to rain but george stood unheeding staring at the little sign
damn them he said finally and turning up his coatcollar plodded back through the soggy streets toward home  the utilitarian impudence of the city authorities put a thought into his mind
a week earlier he had happened to stroll into the large parlour of the apartment house finding it empty and on the center table he noticed a large redbound giltedged book newly printed bearing the title a civic history and beneath the title the rubric biographies of the  most prominent citizens and families in the history of the city he had glanced at it absently merely noticing the title and subtitle and wandered out of the room thinking of other things and feeling no curiosity about the book
but he had thought of it several times since with a faint vague uneasiness and now when he entered the lobby he walked directly into the parlour where he had seen the book
the room was empty as it always was on sunday mornings and the flamboyant volume was still upon the tableevidently a fixture as a sort of local almanach de gotha or burke for the enlightenment of tenants and boarders
he opened it finding a few painful steel engravings of placid chinbearded faces some of which he remembered dimly but much more numerous and also more unfamiliar to him were the pictures of neat aggressive men with clipped short hair and clipped short moustachesalmost all of them strangers to him
he delayed not long with these but turned to the index where the names of the five hundred most prominent citizens and families in the history of the city were arranged in alphabetical order and ran his finger down the column of a's  abbett abbott abrams adam adams adler akers albertsmeyer alexander allen ambrose ambuhl anderson andrews appenbasch archer arszman ashcraft austin avey  george's eyes remained for some time fixed on the thin space between the names allen and ambrose then he closed the book quietly and went up to his own room agreeing with the elevator boy on the way that it was getting to be a mighty nasty wet and windy day outside
the elevator boy noticed nothing unusual about him and neither did fanny when she came in from church with her hat ruined an hour later
and yet something had happeneda thing which years ago had been the eagerest hope of many many good citizens of the town
they had thought of it longed for it hoping acutely that they might live to see the day when it would come to pass
and now it had happened at last georgie minafer had got his comeupance
he had got it three times filled and running over
the city had rolled over his heart burying it under as it rolled over the major's and buried it under
the city had rolled over the ambersons and buried them under to the last vestige and it mattered little that george guessed easily enough that most of the five hundred most prominent had paid something substantial to defray the cost of steel engraving etcthe five hundred had heaved the final shovelful of soot upon that heap of obscurity wherein the ambersons were lost forever from sight and history
quicksilver in a nest of cracks  georgie minafer had got his comeupance but the people who had so longed for it were not there to see it and they never knew it
those who were still living had forgotten all about it and all about him
chapter xxxiv    there was one border section of the city which george never explored in his sunday morning excursions
this was far out to the north where lay the new elysian fields of the millionaires though he once went as far in that direction as the white house which lucy had so admired long agoher beautiful house george looked at it briefly and turned back rumbling with an interior laugh of some grimness
the house was white no longer nothing could be white which the town had reached and the town reached far beyond the beautiful white house now
the owners had given up and painted it a despairing chocolate suitable to the freightyard life it was called upon to endure
george did not again risk going even so far as that in the direction of the millionaires although their settlement began at least two miles farther out
his thought of lucy and her father was more a sensation than a thought and may be compared to that of a convicted cashier beset by recollections of the bank he had pillagedthere are some thoughts to which one closes the mind
george had seen eugene only once since their calamitous encounter
they had passed on opposite sides of the street downtown each had been aware of the other and each had been aware that the other was aware of him and yet each kept his eyes straight forward and neither had shown a perceptible alteration of countenance
it seemed to george that he felt emanating from the outwardly imperturbable person of his mother's old friend a hate that was like a hot wind
at his mother's funeral and at the major's he had been conscious that eugene was there though he had afterward no recollection of seeing him and while certain of his presence was uncertain how he knew of it
fanny had not told him for she understood george well enough not to speak to him of eugene or lucy
nowadays fanny almost never saw either of them and seldom thought of themso sly is the way of time with life
she was passing middle age when old intensities and longings grow thin and flatten out as fanny herself was thinning and flattening out and she was settling down contentedly to her apartment house intimacies
she was precisely suited by the tabled'hote life with its bridge its variable alliances and shifting feuds and the long whisperings of elderly ladies at corridor cornersthose eager but suppressed conversations all sibilance of which the elevator boy declared he heard the words she said a million times and the word she five million
the apartment house suited fanny and swallowed her
the city was so big now that people disappeared into it unnoticed and the disappearance of fanny and her nephew was not exceptional
people no longer knew their neighbours as a matter of course one lived for years next door to strangersthat sharpest of all the changes since the old daysand a friend would lose sight of a friend for a year and not know it
one may day george thought he had a glimpse of lucy
he was not certain but he was sufficiently disturbed in spite of his uncertainty
a promotion in his work now frequently took him out of town for a week or longer and it was upon his return from one of these absences that he had the strange experience
he had walked home from the station and as he turned the corner which brought him in sight of the apartment house entrance though two blocks distant from it he saw a charming little figure come out get into a shiny landaulet automobile and drive away
even at that distance no one could have any doubt that the little figure was charming and the height the quickness and decision of motion even the swift gesture of a white glove toward the chauffeurall were characteristic of lucy
george was instantly subjected to a shock of indefinable nature yet definitely a shock he did not know what he feltbut he knew that he felt
heat surged over him probably he would not have come face to face with her if the restoration of all the ancient amberson magnificence could have been his reward
he went on slowly his knees shaky
but he found fanny not at home she had been out all afternoon and there was no record of any callerand he began to wonder then to doubt if the small lady he had seen in the distance was lucy
it might as well have been he said to himselfsince any one who looked like her could give him a jolt like that  lucy had not left a card
she never left one when she called on fanny though she did not give her reasons a quite definite form in her own mind
she came seldom this was but the third time that year and when she did come george was not mentioned either by her hostess or by herselfan oddity contrived between the two ladies without either of them realizing how odd it was
for naturally while fanny was with lucy fanny thought of george and what time lucy had george's aunt before her eyes she could not well avoid the thought of him
consequently both looked absentminded as they talked and each often gave a wrong answer which the other consistently failed to notice
at other times lucy's thoughts of george were anything but continuous and weeks went by when he was not consciously in her mind at all
her life was a busy one she had the big house to keep up she had a garden to keep up too a large and beautiful garden she represented her father as a director for half a dozen public charity organizations and did private charity work of her own being a proxy mother of several large families and she had danced down as she said groups from eight or nine classes of new graduates returned from the universities without marrying any of them but she still dancedand still did not marry
her father observing this circumstance happily yet with some hypocritical concern spoke of it to her one day as they stood in her garden
i suppose i'd want to shoot him he said with attempted lightness
but i mustn't be an old pig
i'd build you a beautiful house close byjust over yonder  no no
that would be like she began impulsively then checked herself
george amberson's comparison of the georgian house to the amberson mansion had come into her mind and she thought that another new house built close by for her would be like the house the major built for isabel
like what  nothing she looked serious and when he reverted to his idea of some day grudgingly surrendering her up to a suitor she invented a legend
did you ever hear the indian name for that little grove of beech trees on the other side of the house she asked him
noand you never did either he laughed
don't be so sure
i read a great deal more than i used togetting ready for my bookish days when i'll have to do something solid in the evenings and won't be asked to dance any more even by the very youngest boys who think it's a sporting event to dance with the oldest of the 'older girls'
the name of the grove was 'lomanashah' and it means 'theycouldn'thelpit'  doesn't sound like it  indian names don't
there was a bad indian chief lived in the grove before the white settlers came
he was the worst indian that ever lived and his name wasit was 'vendonah'
that means 'ridesdowneverything'  what  his name was vendonah the same thing as ridesdowneverything  i see said eugene thoughtfully
he gave her a quick look and then fixed his eyes upon the end of the garden path
go on  vendonah was an unspeakable case lucy continued
he was so proud that he wore iron shoes and he walked over people's faces with them
he was always killing people that way and so at last the tribe decided that it wasn't a good enough excuse for him that he was young and inexperiencedhe'd have to go
they took him down to the river and put him in a canoe and pushed him out from shore and then they ran along the bank and wouldn't let him land until at last the current carried the canoe out into the middle and then on down to the ocean and he never got back
they didn't want him back of course and if he'd been able to manage it they'd have put him in another canoe and shoved him out into the river again
but still they didn't elect another chief in his place
other tribes thought that was curious and wondered about it a lot but finally they came to the conclusion that the beech grove people were afraid a new chief might turn out to be a bad indian too and wear iron shoes like vendonah
but they were wrong because the real reason was that the tribe had led such an exciting life under vendonah that they couldn't settle down to anything tamer
he was awful but he always kept things happeningterrible things of course
they hated him but they weren't able to discover any other warrior that they wanted to make chief in his place
i suppose it was a little like drinking a glass of too strong wine and then trying to take the taste out of your mouth with barley water
they couldn't help feeling that way  i see said eugene
so that's why they named the place 'theycouldn'thelpit'  it must have been  and so you're going to stay here in your garden he said musingly
you think it's better to keep on walking these sunshiny gravel paths between your flowerbeds and growing to look like a pensive garden lady in a victorian engraving  i suppose i'm like the tribe that lived here papa
i had too much unpleasant excitement
it was unpleasantbut it was excitement
i don't want any more in fact i don't want anything but you  you don't he looked at her keenly and she laughed and shook her head but he seemed perplexed rather doubtful
what was the name of the grove he asked
the indian name i mean  molahaha  no it wasn't that wasn't the name you said  i've forgotten  i see you have he said his look of perplexity remaining
perhaps you remember the chief's name better  she shook her head again
i don't  at this he laughed but not very heartily and walked slowly to the house leaving her bending over a rosebush and a shade more pensive than the most pensive garden lady in any victorian engraving
 next day it happened that this same vendonah or ridesdowneverything became the subject of a chance conversation between eugene and his old friend kinney father of the firetopped fred
the two gentlemen found themselves smoking in neighbouring leather chairs beside a broad window at the club after lunch
mr kinney had remarked that he expected to get his family established at the seashore by the fourth of july and following a train of thought he paused and chuckled
fourth of july reminds me he said
have you heard what that georgie minafer is doing  no i haven't said eugene and his friend failed to notice the crispness of the utterance
well sir kinney chuckled again it beats the devil
my boy fred told me about it yesterday
he's a friend of this young henry akers son of f p akers of the akers chemical company
it seems this young akers asked fred if he knew a fellow named minafer because he knew fred had always lived here and young akers had heard some way that minafer used to be an old family name here and was sort of curious about it
well sir you remember this young georgie sort of disappeared after his grandfather's death and nobody seemed to know much what had become of himthough i did hear once or twice that he was still around somewhere
well sir he's working for the akers chemical company out at their plant on the thomasvile road  he paused seeming to reserve something to be delivered only upon inquiry and eugene offered him the expected question but only after a cold glance through the noseglasses he had lately found it necessary to adopt
what does he do  kinney laughed and slapped the arm of his chair
he's a nitroglycerin expert  he was gratified to see that eugene was surprised if not indeed a little startled
he's what  he's an expert on nitroglycerin
doesn't that beat the devil
yes sir
young akers told fred that this george minafer had worked like a houn'dog ever since he got started out at the works
they have a special plant for nitroglycerin way off from the main plant o' coursein the woods somewhereand george minafer's been working there and lately they put him in charge of it
he oversees shooting oilwells too and shoots 'em himself sometimes
they aren't allowed to carry it on the railroads you knowhave to team it
young akers says george rides around over the bumpy roads sitting on as much as three hundred quarts of nitroglycerin
my lord
talk about romantic tumbles
if he gets blown skyhigh some day he won't have a bigger drop when he comes down than he's already had
don't it beat the devil
young akers said he's got all the nerve there is in the world
well he always did have plenty of thatfrom the time he used to ride around here on his white pony and fight all the irish boys in cantown with his long curls all handy to be pulled out
akers says he gets a fair salary and i should think he ought to
seems to me i've heard the average life in that sort of work is somewhere around four years and agents don't write any insurance at all for nitroglycerin experts
hardly  no said eugene
i suppose not  kinney rose to go
well it's a pretty funny thingpretty odd i meanand i suppose it would be passaroundthehat for old fanny minafer if he blew up
fred told me that they're living in some apartment house and said georgie supports her
he was going to study law but couldn't earn enough that way to take care of fanny so he gave it up
fred's wife told him all this
says fanny doesn't do anything but play bridge these days
got to playing too high for awhile and lost more than she wanted to tell georgie about and borrowed a little from old frank bronson
paid him back though
don't know how fred's wife heard it
women do' hear the darndest things  they do eugene agreed
i thought you'd probably heard about itthought most likely fred's wife might have said something to your daughter especially as they're cousins  i think not  well i'm off to the store said mr kinney briskly yet he lingered
i suppose we'll all have to club in and keep old fanny out of the poorhouse if he does blow up
from all i hear it's usually only a question of time
they say she hasn't got anything else to depend on  i suppose not  welli wondered kinney hesitated
i was wondering why you hadn't thought of finding something around your works for him
they say he's an allfired worker and he certainly does seem to have hid some decent stuff in him under all his damfoolishness
and you used to be such a tremendous friend of the familyi thought perhaps youof course i know he's a queer loti know  yes i think he is said eugene
no
i haven't anything to offer him  i suppose not kinney returned thoughtfully as he went out
i don't know that i would myself
well we'll probably see his name in the papers some day if he stays with that job  however the nitroglycerin expert of whom they spoke did not get into the papers as a consequence of being blown up although his daily life was certainly a continuous exposure to that risk
destiny has a constant passion for the incongruous and it was george's lot to manipulate wholesale quantities of terrific and volatile explosives in safety and to be laid low by an accident so commonplace and inconsequent that it was a comedy
fate had reserved for him the final insult of riding him down under the wheels of one of those juggernauts at which he had once shouted git a hoss nevertheless fate's ironic choice for georgie's undoing was not a big and swift and momentous car such as eugene manufactured it was a specimen of the hustling little type that was flooding the country the cheapest commonest hardiest little car ever made
the accident took place upon a sunday morning on a downtown crossing with the streets almost empty and no reason in the world for such a thing to happen
he had gone out for his sunday morning walk and he was thinking of an automobile at the very moment when the little car struck him he was thinking of a shiny landaulet and a charming figure stepping into it and of the quick gesture of a white glove toward the chauffeur motioning him to go on
george heard a shout but did not look up for he could not imagine anybody's shouting at him and he was too engrossed in the question was it lucy he could not decide and his lack of decision in this matter probably superinduced a lack of decision in another more pressingly vital
at the second and louder shout he did look up and the car was almost on him but he could not make up his mind if the charming little figure he had seen was lucy's and he could not make up his mind whether to go backward or forward these questions became entangled in his mind
then still not being able to decide which of two ways to go he tried to go bothand the little car ran him down
it was not moving very rapidly but it went all the way over george
he was conscious of gigantic violence of roaring and jolting and concussion of choking clouds of dust shot with lightning about his head he heard snapping sounds as loud as shots from a small pistol and was stabbed by excruciating pains in his legs
then he became aware that the machine was being lifted off of him
people were gathering in a circle round him gabbling
his forehead was bedewed with the sweat of anguish and he tried to wipe off this dampness but failed
he could not get his arm that far
nev' mind a policeman said and george could see above his eyes the skirts of the blue coat covered with dust and sunshine
amb'lance be here in a minute
nev' mind tryin' to move any
you want 'em to send for some special doctor  no george's lips formed the word
or to take you to some private hospital  tell them to take me he said faintly to the city hospital  a' right  a smallish young man in a duster fidgeted among the crowd explaining and protesting and a strident voiced girl his companion supported his argument declaring to everyone her willingness to offer testimony in any court of law that every blessed word he said was the god's truth
it's the fella that hit you the policeman said looking down on george
i guess he's right you must of been thinkin' about somep'm' or other
it's wunnerful the damage them little machines can doyou'd never think itbut i guess they ain't much case ag'in this fella that was drivin' it  you bet your life they ain't no case on me the young man in the duster agreed with great bitterness
he came and stood at george's feet addressing him heatedly i'm sorry fer you all right and i don't say i ain't
i hold nothin' against you but it wasn't any more my fault than the statehouse
you run into me much as i run into you and if you get well you ain't goin' to get not one single cent out o' me
this lady here was settin' with me and we both yelled at you
wasn't goin' a step over eight mile an hour
i'm perfectly willing to say i'm sorry for you though and so's the lady with me
we're both willing to say that much but that's all understand  george's drawn eyelids twitched his misted glance rested fleetingly upon the two protesting motorists and the old imperious spirit within him flickered up in a single word
lying on his back in the middle of the street where he was regarded as an increasing public as an unpleasant curiosity he spoke this word clearly from a mouth filled with dust and from lips smeared with blood
it was a word which interested the policeman
when the ambulance clanged away he turned to a fellow patrolman who had joined him
funny what he says to the little cuss that done the damage
that's all he did call him'nothin' else at alland the cuss had broke both his legs fer him and godknowswhatall  i wasn't here then
what was it  riffraff     chapter xxxv    eugene's feeling about george had not been altered by his talk with kinney in the club window though he was somewhat disturbed
he was not disturbed by kinney's hint that fanny minafer might be left on the hands of her friends through her nephew's present dealings with nitroglycerin but he was surprised that kinney had led up with intentional tact to the suggestion that a position might be made for george in the morgan factory
eugene did not care to have any suggestions about georgie minafer made to him
kinney had represented georgie as a new georgieat least in spotsa georgie who was proving that decent stuff had been hid in him in fact a georgie who was doing rather a handsome thing in taking a risky job for the sake of his aunt poor old silly fanny minafer
eugene didn't care what risks georgie took or how much decent stuff he had in him nothing that georgie would ever do in this world or the next could change eugene morgan's feeling toward him
if eugene could possibly have brought himself to offer georgie a position in the automobile business he knew full well the proud devil wouldn't have taken it from him though georgie's proud reason would not have been the one attributed to him by eugene
george would never reach the point where he could accept anything material from eugene and preserve the selfrespect he had begun to regain
but if eugene had wished he could easily have taken george out of the nitroglycerin branch of the chemical works
always interested in apparent impossibilities of invention eugene had encouraged many experiments in such gropings as those for the discovery of substitutes for gasoline and rubber and though his mood had withheld the information from kinney he had recently bought from the elder akers a substantial quantity of stock on the condition that the chemical company should establish an experimental laboratory
he intended to buy more akers was anxious to please him and a word from eugene would have placed george almost anywhere in the chemical works
george need never have known it for eugene's purchases of stock were always quiet ones the transaction remained so far between him and akers and could be kept between them
the possibility just edged itself into eugene's mind that is he let it become part of his perceptions long enough for it to prove to him that it was actually a possibility
then he half started with disgust that he should be even idly considering such a thing over his last cigar for the night in his library
no and he threw the cigar into the empty fireplace and went to bed
his bitterness for himself might have worn away but never his bitterness for isabel
he took that thought to bed with himand it was true that nothing george could do would ever change this bitterness of eugene
only george's mother could have changed it
and as eugene fell asleep that night thinking thus bitterly of georgie georgie in the hospital was thinking of eugene
he had come out of ether with no great nausea and had fallen into a reverie though now and then a white sailboat staggered foolishly into the small ward where he lay
after a time he discovered that this happened only when he tried to open his eyes and look about him so he kept his eyes shut and his thoughts were clearer
he thought of eugene morgan and of the major they seemed to be the same person for awhile but he managed to disentangle them and even to understand why he had confused them
long ago his grandfather had been the most striking figure of success in the town as rich as major amberson they used to say
now it was eugene
if i had eugene morgan's money he would hear the workmen daydreaming at the chemical works or if eugene morgan had hold of this place you'd see things hum and the boarders at the table d'hte spoke of the morgan place  as an eighteenthcentury frenchman spoke of versailles
like his uncle george had perceived that the morgan place was the new amberson mansion
his reverie went back to the palatial days of the mansion in his boyhood when he would gallop his pony up the driveway and order the darkey stablemen about while they whooped and obeyed and his grandfather observing from a window would laugh and call out to him that's right georgie
make those lazy rascals jump he remembered his gay young uncles and how the town was eager concerning everything about them and about himself
what a clean pretty town it had been
and in his reverie be saw like a pageant before him the magnificence of the ambersonsits passing and the passing of the ambersons themselves
they had been slowly engulfed without knowing how to prevent it and almost without knowing what was happening to them
the family lot in the shabby older quarter out at the cemetery held most of them now and the name was swept altogether from the new city
but the new great people who had taken their placesthe morgans and akerses and sheridansthey would go too
george saw that
they would pass as the ambersons had passed and though some of them might do better than the major and leave the letters that spelled a name on a hospital or a street it would be only a word and it would not stay forever
nothing stays or holds or keeps where there is growth he somehow perceived vaguely but truly
great caesar dead and turned to clay stopped no hole to keep the wind away
dead caesar was nothing but a tiresome bit of print in a book that schoolboys study for awhile and then forget
the ambersons had passed and the new people would pass and the new people that came after them and then the next new ones and the nextand the next  he had begun to murmur and the man on duty as night nurse for the ward came and bent over him
did you want something  there's nothing in this family business george told him confidentially
even george washington is only something in a book  eugene read a report of the accident in the next morning's paper
he was on the train having just left for new york on business and with less leisure would probably have overlooked the obscure item  legs broken  g a minafer an employee of the akers chemical co was run down by an automobile yesterday at the corner of tennessee and main and had both legs broken
minafer was to blame for the accident according to patrolman f a kax who witnessed the affair
the automobile was a small one driven by herbert cottleman of  noble avenue who stated that he was making less than  miles an hour
minafer is said to belong to a family formerly of considerable prominence in the city
he was taken to the city hospital where physicians stated later that he was suffering from internal injuries besides the fracture of his legs but might recover
eugene read the item twice then tossed the paper upon the opposite seat of his compartment and sat looking out of the window
his feeling toward georgie was changed not a jot by his human pity for georgie's human pain and injury
he thought of georgie's tall and graceful figure and he shivered but his bitterness was untouched
he had never blamed isabel for the weakness which had cost them the few years of happiness they might have had together he had put the blame all on the son and it stayed there
he began to think poignantly of isabel he had seldom been able to see  her more clearly than as he sat looking out of his compartment window after reading the account of this accident
she might have been just on the other side of the glass looking in at himand then he thought of her as the pale figure of a woman seen yet unseen flying through the air beside the train over the fields of springtime green and through the woods that were just sprouting out their little leaves
he closed his eyes and saw her as she had been long ago
he saw the browneyed brownhaired proud gentle laughing girl he had known when first he came to town a boy just out of the state college
he rememberedas he had remembered ten thousand times beforethe look she gave him when her brother george introduced him to her at a picnic it was like hazel starlight he had written her in a poem afterward
he remembered his first call at the amberson mansion and what a great personage she seemed at home in that magnificence and yet so gay and friendly
he remembered the first time he had danced with herand the old waltz song began to beat in his ears and in his heart
they laughed and sang it together as they danced to it  oh love for a year a week a day but alas for the love that lasts always  most plainly of all he could see her dancing and he became articulate in the mourning whisper so gracefuloh so graceful  all the way to new york it seemed to him that isabel was near him and he wrote of her to lucy from his hotel the next night  i saw an account of the accident to george minafer
i'm sorry though the paper states that it was plainly his own fault
i suppose it may have been as a result of my attention falling upon the item that i thought of his mother a great deal on the way here
it seemed to me that i had never seen her more distinctly or so constantly but as you know thinking of his mother is not very apt to make me admire him
of course however he has my best wishes for his recovery
he posted the letter and by the morning's mail he received one from lucy written a few hours after his departure from home
she enclosed the item he had read on the train
i thought you might not see it
i have seen miss fanny and she has got him put into a room by himself
oh poor ridesdowneverything i have been thinking so constantly of his mother and it seemed to me that i have never seen her more distinctly
how lovely she wasand how she loved him
if lucy had not written this letter eugene might not have done the odd thing he did that day
nothing could have been more natural than that both he and lucy should have thought intently of isabel after reading the account of george's accident but the fact that lucy's letter had crossed his own made eugene begin to wonder if a phenomenon of telepathy might not be in question rather than a chance coincidence
the reference to isabel in the two letters was almost identical he and lucy it appeared had been thinking of isabel at the same timeboth said constantly thinking of herand neither had ever seen her more distinctly he remembered these phrases in his own letter accurately
reflection upon the circumstance stirred a queer spot in eugene's brainhe had one
he was an adventurer if he had lived in the sixteenth century he would have sailed the unknown new seas but having been born in the latter part of the nineteenth when geography was a fairly wellsettled matter he had become an explorer in mechanics
but the fact that he was a hardheaded business man as well as an adventurer did not keep him from having a queer spot in his brain because hardheaded business men are as susceptible to such spots as adventurers are
some of them are secretly troubled when they do not see the new moon over the lucky shoulder some of them have strange secret incredulitiesthey do not believe in geology for instance and some of them think they have had supernatural experiences
of course there was nothing in itstill it was queer they say
two weeks after isabel's death eugene had come to new york on urgent business and found that the delayed arrival of a steamer gave him a day with nothing to do
his room at the hotel had become intolerable outdoors was intolerable everything was intolerable
it seemed to him that he must see isabel once more hear her voice once more that he must find some way to her or lose his mind
under this pressure he had gone with complete scepticism to a trancemedium of whom he had heard wild accounts from the wife of a business acquaintance
he thought despairingly that at least such an excursion would be trying to do something he remembered the woman's name found it in the telephone book and made an appointment
the experience had been grotesque and he came away with an encouraging message from his father who had failed to identify himself satisfactorily but declared that everything was on a higher plane  in his present state of being and that all life was continuous and progressive mrs horner spoke of herself as a psychic but otherwise she seemed oddly unpretentious and matteroffact and eugene had no doubt at all of her sincerity
he was sure that she was not an intentional fraud and though he departed in a state of annoyance with himself he came to the conclusion that if any credulity were played upon by mrs horner's exhibitions it was her own
nevertheless his queer spot having been stimulated to action by the coincidence of the letters he went to mrs horner's after his directors' meeting today
he used the telephone booth in the directors' room to make the appointment and he laughed feebly at himself and wondered what the group of men in that mahogany apartment would think if they knew what he was doing
mrs horner had changed her address but he found the new one and somebody purporting to be a niece of hers talked to him and made an appointment for a sitting at five o'clock
he was prompt and the niece a dullfaced fat girl with a magazine under her arm admitted him to mrs horner's apartment which smelt of camphor and showed him into a room with gray painted walls no rug on the floor and no furniture except a table with nothing on it and two chairs one a leather easychair and the other a stiff little brute with a wooden seat
there was one window with the shade pulled down to the sill but the sun was bright outside and the room had light enough
mrs horner appeared in the doorway a wan and unenterprising looking woman in brown with thin hair artificially wavedbut not recentlyand parted in the middle over a bluish forehead
her eyes were small and seemed weak but she recognized the visitor
oh you been here before she said in a thin voice not unmusical
i recollect you
quite a time ago wa'n't it  yes quite a long time  i recollect because i recollect you was disappointed
anyway you was kind of cross she laughed faintly
i'm sorry if i seemed so eugene said
do you happen to have found out my name  she looked surprised and a little reproachful
why no
i never try to find out people's name
why should i
i don't claim anything for the power i only know i have itand some ways it ain't always such a blessing neither i can tell you  eugene did not press an investigation of her meaning but said vaguely i suppose not
shall we  all right she assented dropping into the leather chair with her back to the shaded window
you better set down too i reckon
i hope you'll get something this time so you won't feel cross but i dunno
i can't never tell what they'll do
well  she sighed closed her eyes and was silent while eugene seated in the stiff chair across the table from her watched her profile thought himself an idiot and called himself that and other names
and as the silence continued and the impassive woman in the easychair remained impassive he began to wonder what had led him to be such a fool
it became clear to him that the similarity of his letter and lucy's needed no explanation involving telepathy and was not even an extraordinary coincidence
what then had brought him back to this absurd place and caused him to be watching this absurd woman taking a nap in a chair
in brief what the devil did he mean by it
he had not the slightest interest in mrs horner's napsor in her teeth which were being slightly revealed by the unconscious parting of her lips as her breathing became heavier
if the vagaries of his own mind had brought him into such a grotesquerie as this into what did the vagaries of other men's minds take them
confident that he was ordinarily saner than most people he perceived that since he was capable of doing a thing like this other men did even more idiotic things in secret
and he had a fleeting vision of soberlooking bankers and manufacturers and lawyers welldressed churchgoing men sound citizensand all as queer as the deuce inside
how long was he going to sit here presiding over this unknown woman's slumbers
it struck him that to make the picture complete he ought to be shooing flies away from her with a palmleaf fan
mrs horner's parted lips closed again abruptly and became compressed her shoulders moved a little then jerked repeatedly her small chest heaved she gasped and the compressed lips relaxed to a slight contortion then began to move whispering and bringing forth indistinguishable mutterings
suddenly she spoke in a loud husky voice  lopa is here  yes eugene said dryly
that's what you said last time
i remember 'lopa'
she's your 'control' i think you said  i'm lopa said the husky voice
i'm lopa herself  you mean i'm to suppose you're not mrs horner now  never was mrs horner the voice declared speaking undeniably from mrs horner's lipsbut with such conviction that eugene in spite of everything began to feel himself in the presence of a third party who was none the less an individual even though she might be another edition of the apparently somnambulistic mrs horner
never was mrs horner or anybody but just lopa
guide  you mean you're mrs horner's guide he asked
your guide now said the voice with emphasis to which was incongruously added a low laugh
you came here once before
lopa remembers  yesso did mrs horner  lopa overlooked his implication and continued quickly you build
build things that go
you came here once and old gentleman on this side he spoke to you
same old gentleman here now
he tell lopa he's your grandfatherno he says 'father'
he's your father  what's his appearance  how  what does he look like  very fine
white beard but not long beard
he says someone else wants to speak to you
see here
lady
not his wife though
no
very fine lady
fine lady fine lady  is it my sister eugene asked
sister
no
she is shaking her head
she has pretty brown hair
she is fond of you
she is someone who knows you very well but she is not your sister
she is very anxious to say something to youvery anxious
very fond of you very anxious to talk to you
very glad you came hereoh very glad  what is her name  name the voice repeated and seemed to ruminate
name hard to getalways very hard for lopa
name
she wants to tell me her name to tell you
she wants you to understand names are hard to make
she says you must think of something that makes a sound here the voice seemed to put a question to an invisible presence and to receive an answer
a little sound or a big sound
she says it might be a little sound or a big sound
she says a ringoh lopa knows
she means a bell
that's it a bell  eugene looked grave
does she mean her name is belle  not quite
her name is longer  perhaps he suggested she means that she was a belle  no
she says she thinks you know what she means
she says you must think of a colour
what colour again lopa addressed the unknown but this time seemed to wait for an answer
perhaps she means the colour of her eyes said eugene
no
she says her colour is lightit's a light colour and you can see through it  amber he said and was startled for mrs horner with her eyes still closed clapped her hands and the voice cried out in delight  yes
she says you know who she is from amber
amber
amber
that's it
she says you understand what her name is from a bell and from amber
she is laughing and waving a lace handkerchief at me because she is pleased
she says i have made you know who it is  this was the strangest moment of eugene's life because while it lasted he believed that isabel amberson who was dead had found means to speak to him
though within ten minutes he doubted it he believed it then
his elbows pressed hard upon the table and his head between his hands he leaned forward staring at the commonplace figure in the easychair
what does she wish to say to me  she is happy because you know her
noshe is troubled
oha great trouble
something she wants to tell you
she wants so much to tell you
she wants lopa to tell you
this is a great trouble
she saysoh yes she wants you to beto be kind
that's what she says
that's it
to be kind  does she  she wants you to be kind said the voice
she nods when i tell you this
yes it must be right
she is a very fine lady
very pretty
she is so anxious for you to understand
she hopes and hopes you will
someone else wants to speak to you
this is a man
he says  i don't want to speak to any one else said eugene quickly
i want  this man who has come says that he is a friend of yours
he says  eugene struck the table with his fist
i don't want to speak to any one else i tell you he cried passionately
if she is there i he caught his breath sharply checked himself and sat in amazement
could his mind so easily accept so stupendous a thing as true
evidently it could
mrs horner spoke languidly in her own voice did you get anything satisfactory she asked
i certainly hope it wasn't like that other time when you was cross because they couldn't get anything for you  no no he said hastily
this was different it was very interesting  he paid her went to his hotel and thence to his train for home
never did he so seem to move through a world of dreamstuff for he knew that he was not more credulous than other men and if he could believe what he had believed though he had believed it for no longer than a moment or two what hold had he or any other human being on reality
his credulity vanished or so he thought with his recollection that it was he and not the alleged lopa who had suggested the word amber  going over the mortifying plain facts of his experience he found that mrs horner or the subdivision of mrs horner known as lopa had told him to think of a bell and of a colour and that being furnished with these scientific data he had leaped to the conclusion that he spoke with isabel amberson
for a moment he had believed that isabel was there believed that she was close to him entreating himentreating him to be kind but with this recollection a strange agitation came upon him
after all had she not spoken to him
if his own unknown consciousness had told the psychic's unknown consciousness how to make the picture of the pretty brownhaired browneyed lady hadn't the picture been a true one
and hadn't the true isabeloh indeed her very soulcalled to him out of his own true memory of her
and as the train roared through the darkened evening he looked out beyond his window and saw her as he had seen her on his journey a few days agoan ethereal figure flying beside the train but now it seemed to him that she kept her face toward his window with an infinite wistfulness
to be kind if it had been isabel was that what she would have said
if she were anywhere and could come to him through the invisible wall what would be the first thing she would say to him
ah well enough and perhaps bitterly enough he knew the answer to that question
to be kindto georgie
a redcap at the station when he arrived leaped for his bag abandoning another which the pullman porter had handed him
yessuh mist' morgan
yessuh
you' car waitin' front the station fer you mist' morgan suh  and people in the crowd about the gates turned to stare as he passed through whispering that's morgan  outside the neat chauffeur stood at the door of the touringcar like a soldier in whipcord
i'll not go home now harry said eugene when he had got in
drive to the city hospital  yes sir the man returned
miss lucy's there
she said she expected you'd come there before you went home  she did  yes sir  eugene stared
i suppose mr minafer must be pretty bad he said
yes sir
i understand he's liable to get well though sir he moved his lever into high speed and the car went through the heavy traffic like some fast faithful beast that knew its way about and knew its master's need of haste
eugene did not speak again until they reached the hospital
fanny met him in the upper corridor and took him to an open door
he stopped on the threshold startled for from the waxen face on the pillow almost it seemed the eyes of isabel herself were looking at him never before had the resemblance between mother and son been so strongand eugene knew that now he had once seen it thus startlingly he need divest himself of no bitterness to be kind to georgie
george was startled too
he lifted a white hand in a queer gesture half forbidding half imploring and then let his arm fall back upon the coverlet
you must have thought my mother wanted you to come he said so that i could ask you toto forgive me  but lucy who sat beside him lifted ineffable eyes from him to her father and shook her head
no just to take his handgently  she was radiant
but for eugene another radiance filled the room
he knew that he had been true at last to his true love and that through him she had brought her boy under shelter again
her eyes would look wistful no more
the end
