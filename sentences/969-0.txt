conclusion list of illustrations portrait of anne bront moorland scene haworth moorland scene with water haworth moorland scene with cottage haworth blake hallthe approach grassdale manor blake hallfront grassdale manor blake hallside grassdale manor illustration introduction anne bront serves a twofold purpose in the study of what the bronts wrote and were
in the first place her gentle and delicate presence her sad short story her hard life and early death enter deeply into the poetry and tragedy that have always been entwined with the memory of the bronts as women and as writers in the second the books and poems that she wrote serve as matter of comparison by which to test the greatness of her two sisters
she is the measure of their geniuslike them yet not with them
many years after annes death her brotherinlaw protested against a supposed portrait of her as giving a totally wrong impression of the dear gentle anne bront dear and gentle indeed she seems to have been through life the youngest and prettiest of the sisters with a delicate complexion a slender neck and small pleasant features
notwithstanding she possessed in full the bront seriousness the bront strength of will
when her father asked her at four years old what a little child like her wanted most the tiny creature repliedif it were not a bront it would be incredibleage and experience when the three children started their island plays together in anne who was then eight chose guernsey for her imaginary island and peopled it with michael sadler lord bentinck and sir henry halford she and emily were constant companions and there is evidence that they shared a common world of fancy from very early days to mature womanhood
the gondal chronicles seem to have amused them for many years and to have branched out into innumerable books written in the tiny writing of which mr clement shorter has given us facsimiles
i am now engaged in writing the fourth volume of solala vernons life says anne at twentyone
and four years later emily says the gondals still flourish bright as ever
i am at present writing a work on the first war
anne has been writing some articles on this and a book by henry sophona
we intend sticking firm by the rascals as long as they delight us which i am glad to say they do at present that the author of wildfell hall should ever have delighted in the gondals should ever have written the story of solala vernon or henry sophona is pleasant to know
then for her too as for her sisters there was a moment when the power of making out could turn loneliness and disappointment into riches and content
for a time at least and before a hard and degrading experience had broken the spring of her youth and replaced the disinterested and spontaneous pleasure that is to be got from the life and play of imagination by a sad sense of duty and an inexorable consciousness of moral and religious mission anne bront wrote stories for her own amusement and loved the rascals she created
but already in when we first hear of the gondals and solala vernon the material for quite other books was in poor annes mind
she was then teaching in the family at thorpe green where branwell joined her as tutor in and where owing to events that are still a mystery she seems to have passed through an ordeal that left her shattered in health and nerve with nothing gained but those melancholy and repulsive memories that she was afterwards to embody in wildfell hall she seems indeed to have been partly the victim of branwells morbid imagination the imagination of an opiumeater and a drunkard
that he was neither the conqueror nor the villain that he made his sisters believe all the evidence that has been gathered since mrs gaskell wrote goes to show
but poor anne believed his account of himself and no doubt saw enough evidence of vicious character in branwells daily life to make the worst enormities credible
she seems to have passed the last months of her stay at thorpe green under a cloud of dread and miserable suspicion and was thankful to escape from her situation in the summer of
at the same moment branwell was summarily dismissed from his tutorship his employer mr robinson writing a stern letter of complaint to branwells father concerned no doubt with the young mans disorderly and intemperate habits
mrs gaskell says the premature deaths of two at least of the sistersall the great possibilities of their earthly lives snapped shortmay be dated from midsummer the facts as we now know them hardly bear out so strong a judgment
there is nothing to show that branwells conduct was responsible in any way for emilys illness and death and anne in the contemporary fragment recovered by mr
shorter gives a less tragic account of the matter
during my stay at thorpe green she writes on july i have had some very unpleasant and undreamtof experience of human nature branwell has
been a tutor at thorpe green and had much tribulation and illhealth we hope he will be better and do better in future and at the end of the paper she says sadly forecasting the coming years i for my part cannot well be flatter or older in mind than i am now this is the language of disappointment and anxiety but it hardly fits the tragic story that mrs gaskell believed
that story was no doubt the elaboration of branwells diseased fancy during the three years which elapsed between his dismissal from thorpe green and his death
he imagined a guilty romance with himself and his employers wife for characters and he imposed the horrid story upon his sisters
opium and drink are the sufficient explanations and no time need now be wasted upon unravelling the sordid mystery
but the vices of the brother real or imaginary have a certain importance in literature because of the effect they produced upon his sisters
there can be no question that branwells opium madness his bouts of drunkenness at the black bull his violence at home his free and coarse talk and his perpetual boast of guilty secrets influenced the imagination of his wholly pure and inexperienced sisters
much of wuthering heights and all of wildfell hall show branwells mark and there are many passages in charlottes books also where those who know the history of the parsonage can hear the voice of those sharp moral repulsions those dismal moral questionings to which branwells misconduct and ruin gave rise
their brothers fate was an element in the genius of emily and charlotte which they were strong enough to assimilate which may have done them some harm and weakened in them certain delicate or sane perceptions but was ultimately by the strange alchemy of talent far more profitable than hurtful inasmuch as it troubled the waters of the soul and brought them near to the more desperate realities of our frail falln humankind but anne was not strong enough her gift was not vigorous enough to enable her thus to transmute experience and grief
the probability is that when she left thorpe green in she was already suffering from that religious melancholy of which charlotte discovered such piteous evidence among her papers after death
it did not much affect the writing of agnes grey which was completed in and reflected the minor pains and discomforts of her teaching experience but it combined with the spectacle of branwells increasing moral and physical decay to produce that bitter mandate of conscience under which she wrote the tenant of wildfell hall hers was naturally a sensitive reserved and dejected nature
she hated her work but would pursue it
it was written as a warningso said charlotte when in the pathetic preface of she was endeavouring to explain to the public how a creature so gentle and so good as acton bell should have written such a book as wildfell hall and in the second edition of wildfell hall which appeared in anne bront herself justified her novel in a preface which is reprinted in this volume for the first time
the little preface is a curious document
it has the same determined didactic tone which pervades the book itself the same narrowness of view and inflation of expression an inflation which is really due not to any personal egotism in the writer but rather to that very gentleness and inexperience which must yet nerve itself under the stimulus of religion to its disagreeable and repulsive task
i knew that such charactersas huntingdon and his companionsdo exist and if i have warned one rash youth from following in their steps the book has not been written in vain if the story has given more pain than pleasure to any honest reader the writer craves his pardon for such was far from my intention but at the same time she cannot promise to limit her ambition to the giving of innocent pleasure or to the production of a perfect work of art time and talent so spent i should consider wasted and misapplied god has given her unpalatable truths to speak and she must speak them
the measure of misconstruction and abuse therefore which her book brought upon her she bore says her sister as it was her custom to bear whatever was unpleasant with mild steady patience
she was a very sincere and practical christian but the tinge of religious melancholy communicated a sad shade to her brief blameless life in spite of misconstruction and abuse however wildfell hall seems to have attained more immediate success than anything else written by the sisters before except jane eyre it went into a second edition within a very short time of its publication and messrs newby informed the american publishers with whom they were negotiating that it was the work of the same hand which had produced jane eyre and superior to either jane eyre or wuthering heights
it was indeed the sharp practice connected with this astonishing judgment which led to the sisters hurried journey to london in the famous journey when the two little ladies in black revealed themselves to mr smith and proved to him that they were not one currer bell but two miss bronts
it was annes sole journey to londonher only contact with a world that was not haworth except that supplied by her schoollife at roehead and her two teaching engagements
and there was and is a considerable narrative ability a sheer moral energy in wildfell hall which would not be enough indeed to keep it alive if it were not the work of a bront but still betray its kinship and source
the scenes of huntingdons wickedness are less interesting but less improbable than the countryhouse scenes of jane eyre the story of his death has many true and touching passages the last lovescene is well even in parts admirably written
but the books truth so far as it is true is scarcely the truth of imagination it is rather the truth of a tract or a report
there can be little doubt that many of the pages are close transcripts from branwells conduct and languageso far as annes slighter personality enabled her to render her brothers temperament which was more akin to emilys than to her own
the same material might have been used by emily or charlotte emily as we know did make use of it in wuthering heights but only after it had passed through that ineffable transformation that mysterious incommunicable heightening which makes and gives rank in literature
some subtle innate correspondence between eye and brain between brain and hand was present in emily and charlotte and absent in anne
there is no other account to be given of this or any other case of difference between serviceable talent and the high gifts of delos and pataras own apollo the same world of difference appears between her poems and those of her playfellow and comrade emily
if ever our descendants should establish the schools for writers which are even now threatened or attempted they will hardly know perhaps any better than we what genius is nor how it can be produced
but if they try to teach by example then anne and emily bront are ready to their hand
take the verses written by emily at roehead which contain the lovely lines which i have already quoted in an earlier introduction just before those lines there are two or three verses which it is worth while to compare with a poem of annes called home emily was sixteen at the time of writing anne about twentyone or twentytwo
both sisters take for their motive the exiles longing thought of home
emilys lines are full of faults but they have the indefinable qualityhere no doubt only in the bud only as a matter of promisewhich annes are entirely without
from the twilight schoolroom at roehead emily turns in thought to the distant upland of haworth and the little stonebuilt house upon its crest there is a spot mid barren hills where winter howls and driving rain but if the dreary tempest chills there is a light that warms again
the house is old the trees are bare moonless above bends twilights dome but what on earth is half so dear so longed foras the hearth of home
the mute bird sitting on the stone the dank moss dripping from the wall the thorntrees gaunt the walks oergrown i love themhow i love them all
annes verses written from one of the houses where she was a governess express precisely the same feeling and movement of mind
but notice the instinctive rightness and swiftness of emilys the blurred weakness of annes for yonder garden fair and wide with groves of evergreen long winding walks and borders trim and velvet lawns between restore to me that little spot with gray walls compassed round where knotted grass neglected lies and weeds usurp the ground
though all around this mansion high invites the foot to roam and though its halls are fair within oh give me back my home
a similar parallel lies between annes lines domestic peacea sad and true reflection of the terrible times with branwell in and emilys wanderer from the fold while in emilys last lines the daring spirit of the sister to whom the magic gift was granted separates itself for ever from the gentle and accustomed piety of the sister to whom it was denied
yet annes last linesi hoped that with the brave and stronghave sweetness and sincerity they have gained and kept a place in english religious verse and they must always appeal to those who love the bronts because in the language of christian faith and submission they record the death of emily and the passionate affection which her sisters bore her
and so we are brought back to the point from which we started
it is not as the writer of wildfell hall but as the sister of charlotte and emily bront that anne bront escapes oblivionas the frail little one upon whom the other two lavished a tender and protecting care who was a witness of emilys death and herself within a few minutes of her own farewell to life bade charlotte take courage when my thoughts turn to anne said charlotte many years earlier they always see her as a patient persecuted strangermore lonely less gifted with the power of making friends even than i am later on however this power of making friends seems to have belonged to anne in greater measure than to the others
her gentleness conquered she was not set apart as they were by the lonely and selfsufficing activities of great powers her christianity though sad and timid was of a kind which those around her could understand she made no grim fight with suffering and death as did emily
emily was torn from life conscious panting reluctant to use charlottes own words annes sufferings were mild her mind generally serene and at the last she thanked god that death was come and come so gently when charlotte returned to the desolate house at haworth emilys large housedog and annes little spaniel welcomed her in a strange hearttouching way she writes to mr williams
she alone was left heir to all the memories and tragedies of the house
she took up again the task of life and labour
she cared for her father she returned to the writing of shirley and when she herself passed away four years later she had so turned those years to account that not only all she did but all she loved had passed silently into the keeping of fame
mrs gaskells touching and delightful task was ready for her and anne no less than charlotte and emily was sure of englands remembrance

authors preface to the second edition while i acknowledge the success of the present work to have been greater than i anticipated and the praises it has elicited from a few kind critics to have been greater than it deserved i must also admit that from some other quarters it has been censured with an asperity which i was as little prepared to expect and which my judgment as well as my feelings assures me is more bitter than just
it is scarcely the province of an author to refute the arguments of his censors and vindicate his own productions but i may be allowed to make here a few observations with which i would have prefaced the first edition had i foreseen the necessity of such precautions against the misapprehensions of those who would read it with a prejudiced mind or be content to judge it by a hasty glance
my object in writing the following pages was not simply to amuse the reader neither was it to gratify my own taste nor yet to ingratiate myself with the press and the public i wished to tell the truth for truth always conveys its own moral to those who are able to receive it
but as the priceless treasure too frequently hides at the bottom of a well it needs some courage to dive for it especially as he that does so will be likely to incur more scorn and obloquy for the mud and water into which he has ventured to plunge than thanks for the jewel he procures as in like manner she who undertakes the cleansing of a careless bachelors apartment will be liable to more abuse for the dust she raises than commendation for the clearance she effects
let it not be imagined however that i consider myself competent to reform the errors and abuses of society but only that i would fain contribute my humble quota towards so good an aim and if i can gain the public ear at all i would rather whisper a few wholesome truths therein than much soft nonsense
as the story of agnes grey was accused of extravagant overcolouring in those very parts that were carefully copied from the life with a most scrupulous avoidance of all exaggeration so in the present work i find myself censured for depicting con amore with a morbid love of the coarse if not of the brutal those scenes which i will venture to say have not been more painful for the most fastidious of my critics to read than they were for me to describe
i may have gone too far in which case i shall be careful not to trouble myself or my readers in the same way again but when we have to do with vice and vicious characters i maintain it is better to depict them as they really are than as they would wish to appear
to represent a bad thing in its least offensive light is doubtless the most agreeable course for a writer of fiction to pursue but is it the most honest or the safest
is it better to reveal the snares and pitfalls of life to the young and thoughtless traveller or to cover them with branches and flowers
oh reader
if there were less of this delicate concealment of factsthis whispering peace peace when there is no peace there would be less of sin and misery to the young of both sexes who are left to wring their bitter knowledge from experience
i would not be understood to suppose that the proceedings of the unhappy scapegrace with his few profligate companions i have here introduced are a specimen of the common practices of societythe case is an extreme one as i trusted none would fail to perceive but i know that such characters do exist and if i have warned one rash youth from following in their steps or prevented one thoughtless girl from falling into the very natural error of my heroine the book has not been written in vain
but at the same time if any honest reader shall have derived more pain than pleasure from its perusal and have closed the last volume with a disagreeable impression on his mind i humbly crave his pardon for such was far from my intention and i will endeavour to do better another time for i love to give innocent pleasure
yet be it understood i shall not limit my ambition to thisor even to producing a perfect work of art time and talents so spent i should consider wasted and misapplied
such humble talents as god has given me i will endeavour to put to their greatest use if i am able to amuse i will try to benefit too and when i feel it my duty to speak an unpalatable truth with the help of god i will speak it though it be to the prejudice of my name and to the detriment of my readers immediate pleasure as well as my own
one word more and i have done
respecting the authors identity i would have it to be distinctly understood that acton bell is neither currer nor ellis bell and therefore let not his faults be attributed to them
as to whether the name be real or fictitious it cannot greatly signify to those who know him only by his works
as little i should think can it matter whether the writer so designated is a man or a woman as one or two of my critics profess to have discovered
i take the imputation in good part as a compliment to the just delineation of my female characters and though i am bound to attribute much of the severity of my censors to this suspicion i make no effort to refute it because in my own mind i am satisfied that if a book is a good one it is so whatever the sex of the author may be
all novels are or should be written for both men and women to read and i am at a loss to conceive how a man should permit himself to write anything that would be really disgraceful to a woman or why a woman should be censured for writing anything that would be proper and becoming for a man
july nd
you must go back with me to the autumn of
my father as you know was a sort of gentleman farmer in shire and i by his express desire succeeded him in the same quiet occupation not very willingly for ambition urged me to higher aims and selfconceit assured me that in disregarding its voice i was burying my talent in the earth and hiding my light under a bushel
my mother had done her utmost to persuade me that i was capable of great achievements but my father who thought ambition was the surest road to ruin and change but another word for destruction would listen to no scheme for bettering either my own condition or that of my fellow mortals
he assured me it was all rubbish and exhorted me with his dying breath to continue in the good old way to follow his steps and those of his father before him and let my highest ambition be to walk honestly through the world looking neither to the right hand nor to the left and to transmit the paternal acres to my children in at least as flourishing a condition as he left them to me
wellan honest and industrious farmer is one of the most useful members of society and if i devote my talents to the cultivation of my farm and the improvement of agriculture in general i shall thereby benefit not only my own immediate connections and dependants but in some degree mankind at largehence i shall not have lived in vain with such reflections as these i was endeavouring to console myself as i plodded home from the fields one cold damp cloudy evening towards the close of october
but the gleam of a bright red fire through the parlour window had more effect in cheering my spirits and rebuking my thankless repinings than all the sage reflections and good resolutions i had forced my mind to framefor i was young then rememberonly fourandtwentyand had not acquired half the rule over my own spirit that i now possesstrifling as that may be
however that haven of bliss must not be entered till i had exchanged my miry boots for a clean pair of shoes and my rough surtout for a respectable coat and made myself generally presentable before decent society for my mother with all her kindness was vastly particular on certain points
in ascending to my room i was met upon the stairs by a smart pretty girl of nineteen with a tidy dumpy figure a round face bright blooming cheeks glossy clustering curls and little merry brown eyes
i need not tell you this was my sister rose
she is i know a comely matron still and doubtless no less lovelyin your eyesthan on the happy day you first beheld her
nothing told me then that she a few years hence would be the wife of one entirely unknown to me as yet but destined hereafter to become a closer friend than even herself more intimate than that unmannerly lad of seventeen by whom i was collared in the passage on coming down and wellnigh jerked off my equilibrium and who in correction for his impudence received a resounding whack over the sconce which however sustained no serious injury from the infliction as besides being more than commonly thick it was protected by a redundant shock of short reddish curls that my mother called auburn
on entering the parlour we found that honoured lady seated in her armchair at the fireside working away at her knitting according to her usual custom when she had nothing else to do
she had swept the hearth and made a bright blazing fire for our reception the servant had just brought in the teatray and rose was producing the sugarbasin and teacaddy from the cupboard in the black oak sideboard that shone like polished ebony in the cheerful parlour twilight
well
here they both are cried my mother looking round upon us without retarding the motion of her nimble fingers and glittering needles
now shut the door and come to the fire while rose gets the tea ready im sure you must be starvedand tell me what youve been about all dayi like to know what my children have been about ive been breaking in the grey coltno easy business thatdirecting the ploughing of the last wheat stubblefor the ploughboy has not the sense to direct himselfand carrying out a plan for the extensive and efficient draining of the low meadowlands thats my brave boyand fergus what have you been doing badgerbaiting and here he proceeded to give a particular account of his sport and the respective traits of prowess evinced by the badger and the dogs my mother pretending to listen with deep attention and watching his animated countenance with a degree of maternal admiration i thought highly disproportioned to its object
its time you should be doing something else fergus said i as soon as a momentary pause in his narration allowed me to get in a word
what can i do replied he my mother wont let me go to sea or enter the army and im determined to do nothing elseexcept make myself such a nuisance to you all that you will be thankful to get rid of me on any terms our parent soothingly stroked his stiff short curls
he growled and tried to look sulky and then we all took our seats at the table in obedience to the thricerepeated summons of rose
now take your tea said she and ill tell you what ive been doing
ive been to call on the wilsons and its a thousand pities you didnt go with me gilbert for eliza millward was there well
what of her oh nothingim not going to tell you about heronly that shes a nice amusing little thing when she is in a merry humour and i shouldnt mind calling her hush hush my dear
your brother has no such idea whispered my mother earnestly holding up her finger
well resumed rose i was going to tell you an important piece of news i heard therei have been bursting with it ever since
you know it was reported a month ago that somebody was going to take wildfell hallandwhat do you think
it has actually been inhabited above a weekand we never knew impossible cried my mother
preposterous
shrieked fergus
it has indeedand by a single lady good gracious my dear
the place is in ruins she has had two or three rooms made habitable and there she lives all aloneexcept an old woman for a servant oh dear
that spoils itid hoped she was a witch observed fergus while carving his inchthick slice of bread and butter
nonsense fergus
but isnt it strange mamma strange
i can hardly believe it but you may believe it for jane wilson has seen her
she went with her mother who of course when she heard of a stranger being in the neighbourhood would be on pins and needles till she had seen her and got all she could out of her
she is called mrs graham and she is in mourningnot widows weeds but slightish mourningand she is quite young they saynot above five or six and twentybut so reserved
they tried all they could to find out who she was and where she came from and all about her but neither mrs wilson with her pertinacious and impertinent homethrusts nor miss wilson with her skilful manuvring could manage to elicit a single satisfactory answer or even a casual remark or chance expression calculated to allay their curiosity or throw the faintest ray of light upon her history circumstances or connections
moreover she was barely civil to them and evidently better pleased to say goodby than how do you do but eliza millward says her father intends to call upon her soon to offer some pastoral advice which he fears she needs as though she is known to have entered the neighbourhood early last week she did not make her appearance at church on sunday and sheeliza that iswill beg to accompany him and is sure she can succeed in wheedling something out of heryou know gilbert she can do anything
and we should call some time mamma its only proper you know of course my dear
poor thing
how lonely she must feel and pray be quick about it and mind you bring me word how much sugar she puts in her tea and what sort of caps and aprons she wears and all about it for i dont know how i can live till i know said fergus very gravely
but if he intended the speech to be hailed as a masterstroke of wit he signally failed for nobody laughed
however he was not much disconcerted at that for when he had taken a mouthful of bread and butter and was about to swallow a gulp of tea the humour of the thing burst upon him with such irresistible force that he was obliged to jump up from the table and rush snorting and choking from the room and a minute after was heard screaming in fearful agony in the garden
as for me i was hungry and contented myself with silently demolishing the tea ham and toast while my mother and sister went on talking and continued to discuss the apparent or nonapparent circumstances and probable or improbable history of the mysterious lady but i must confess that after my brothers misadventure i once or twice raised the cup to my lips and put it down again without daring to taste the contents lest i should injure my dignity by a similar explosion
the next day my mother and rose hastened to pay their compliments to the fair recluse and came back but little wiser than they went though my mother declared she did not regret the journey for if she had not gained much good she flattered herself she had imparted some and that was better she had given some useful advice which she hoped would not be thrown away for mrs graham though she said little to any purpose and appeared somewhat selfopinionated seemed not incapable of reflectionthough she did not know where she had been all her life poor thing for she betrayed a lamentable ignorance on certain points and had not even the sense to be ashamed of it
on what points mother asked i
on household matters and all the little niceties of cookery and such things that every lady ought to be familiar with whether she be required to make a practical use of her knowledge or not
i gave her some useful pieces of information however and several excellent receipts the value of which she evidently could not appreciate for she begged i would not trouble myself as she lived in such a plain quiet way that she was sure she should never make use of them
no matter my dear said i it is what every respectable female ought to knowand besides though you are alone now you will not be always so you have been married and probablyi might say almost certainlywill be again you are mistaken there maam said she almost haughtily i am certain i never shallbut i told her i knew better some romantic young widow i suppose said i come there to end her days in solitude and mourn in secret for the dear departedbut it wont last long no i think not observed rose for she didnt seem very disconsolate after all and shes excessively prettyhandsome ratheryou must see her gilbert you will call her a perfect beauty though you could hardly pretend to discover a resemblance between her and eliza millward well i can imagine many faces more beautiful than elizas though not more charming
i allow she has small claims to perfection but then i maintain that if she were more perfect she would be less interesting and so you prefer her faults to other peoples perfections just sosaving my mothers presence oh my dear gilbert what nonsense you talki know you dont mean it its quite out of the question said my mother getting up and bustling out of the room under pretence of household business in order to escape the contradiction that was trembling on my tongue
after that rose favoured me with further particulars respecting mrs graham
her appearance manners and dress and the very furniture of the room she inhabited were all set before me with rather more clearness and precision than i cared to see them but as i was not a very attentive listener i could not repeat the description if i would
the next day was saturday and on sunday everybody wondered whether or not the fair unknown would profit by the vicars remonstrance and come to church
i confess i looked with some interest myself towards the old family pew appertaining to wildfell hall where the faded crimson cushions and lining had been unpressed and unrenewed so many years and the grim escutcheons with their lugubrious borders of rusty black cloth frowned so sternly from the wall above
and there i beheld a tall ladylike figure clad in black
her face was towards me and there was something in it which once seen invited me to look again
her hair was raven black and disposed in long glossy ringlets a style of coiffure rather unusual in those days but always graceful and becoming her complexion was clear and pale her eyes i could not see for being bent upon her prayerbook they were concealed by their drooping lids and long black lashes but the brows above were expressive and well defined the forehead was lofty and intellectual the nose a perfect aquiline and the features in general unexceptionableonly there was a slight hollowness about the cheeks and eyes and the lips though finely formed were a little too thin a little too firmly compressed and had something about them that betokened i thought no very soft or amiable temper and i said in my hearti would rather admire you from this distance fair lady than be the partner of your home just then she happened to raise her eyes and they met mine i did not choose to withdraw my gaze and she turned again to her book but with a momentary indefinable expression of quiet scorn that was inexpressibly provoking to me
she thinks me an impudent puppy thought i
humphshe shall change her mind before long if i think it worth while but then it flashed upon me that these were very improper thoughts for a place of worship and that my behaviour on the present occasion was anything but what it ought to be
previous however to directing my mind to the service i glanced round the church to see if any one had been observing mebut noall who were not attending to their prayerbooks were attending to the strange ladymy good mother and sister among the rest and mrs wilson and her daughter and even eliza millward was slily glancing from the corners of her eyes towards the object of general attraction
then she glanced at me simpered a little and blushed modestly looked at her prayerbook and endeavoured to compose her features
here i was transgressing again and this time i was made sensible of it by a sudden dig in the ribs from the elbow of my pert brother
for the present i could only resent the insult by pressing my foot upon his toes deferring further vengeance till we got out of church
now halford before i close this letter ill tell you who eliza millward was she was the vicars younger daughter and a very engaging little creature for whom i felt no small degree of partialityand she knew it though i had never come to any direct explanation and had no definite intention of so doing for my mother who maintained there was no one good enough for me within twenty miles round could not bear the thoughts of my marrying that insignificant little thing who in addition to her numerous other disqualifications had not twenty pounds to call her own
elizas figure was at once slight and plump her face small and nearly as round as my sisterscomplexion something similar to hers but more delicate and less decidedly bloomingnose retroussfeatures generally irregular and altogether she was rather charming than pretty
but her eyesi must not forget those remarkable features for therein her chief attraction layin outward aspect at leastthey were long and narrow in shape the irids black or very dark brown the expression various and ever changing but always either preternaturallyi had almost said diabolicallywicked or irresistibly bewitchingoften both
her voice was gentle and childish her tread light and soft as that of a catbut her manners more frequently resembled those of a pretty playful kitten that is now pert and roguish now timid and demure according to its own sweet will
her sister mary was several years older several inches taller and of a larger coarser builda plain quiet sensible girl who had patiently nursed their mother through her last long tedious illness and been the housekeeper and family drudge from thence to the present time
she was trusted and valued by her father loved and courted by all dogs cats children and poor people and slighted and neglected by everybody else
the reverend michael millward himself was a tall ponderous elderly gentleman who placed a shovel hat above his large square massivefeatured face carried a stout walkingstick in his hand and incased his still powerful limbs in kneebreeches and gaitersor black silk stockings on state occasions
he was a man of fixed principles strong prejudices and regular habits intolerant of dissent in any shape acting under a firm conviction that his opinions were always right and whoever differed from them must be either most deplorably ignorant or wilfully blind
in childhood i had always been accustomed to regard him with a feeling of reverential awebut lately even now surmounted for though he had a fatherly kindness for the wellbehaved he was a strict disciplinarian and had often sternly reproved our juvenile failings and peccadilloes and moreover in those days whenever he called upon our parents we had to stand up before him and say our catechism or repeat how doth the little busy bee or some other hymn orworse than allbe questioned about his last text and the heads of the discourse which we never could remember
sometimes the worthy gentleman would reprove my mother for being overindulgent to her sons with a reference to old eli or david and absalom which was particularly galling to her feelings and very highly as she respected him and all his sayings i once heard her exclaim i wish to goodness he had a son himself
he wouldnt be so ready with his advice to other people thenhed see what it is to have a couple of boys to keep in order he had a laudable care for his own bodily healthkept very early hours regularly took a walk before breakfast was vastly particular about warm and dry clothing had never been known to preach a sermon without previously swallowing a raw eggalbeit he was gifted with good lungs and a powerful voiceand was generally extremely particular about what he ate and drank though by no means abstemious and having a mode of dietary peculiar to himselfbeing a great despiser of tea and such slops and a patron of malt liquors bacon and eggs ham hung beef and other strong meats which agreed well enough with his digestive organs and therefore were maintained by him to be good and wholesome for everybody and confidently recommended to the most delicate convalescents or dyspeptics who if they failed to derive the promised benefit from his prescriptions were told it was because they had not persevered and if they complained of inconvenient results therefrom were assured it was all fancy
i will just touch upon two other persons whom i have mentioned and then bring this long letter to a close
these are mrs wilson and her daughter
the former was the widow of a substantial farmer a narrowminded tattling old gossip whose character is not worth describing
she had two sons robert a rough countrified farmer and richard a retiring studious young man who was studying the classics with the vicars assistance preparing for college with a view to enter the church
their sister jane was a young lady of some talents and more ambition
she had at her own desire received a regular boardingschool education superior to what any member of the family had obtained before
she had taken the polish well acquired considerable elegance of manners quite lost her provincial accent and could boast of more accomplishments than the vicars daughters
she was considered a beauty besides but never for a moment could she number me amongst her admirers
she was about six and twenty rather tall and very slender her hair was neither chestnut nor auburn but a most decided bright light red her complexion was remarkably fair and brilliant her head small neck long chin well turned but very short lips thin and red eyes clear hazel quick and penetrating but entirely destitute of poetry or feeling
she had or might have had many suitors in her own rank of life but scornfully repulsed or rejected them all for none but a gentleman could please her refined taste and none but a rich one could satisfy her soaring ambition
one gentleman there was from whom she had lately received some rather pointed attentions and upon whose heart name and fortune it was whispered she had serious designs
this was mr lawrence the young squire whose family had formerly occupied wildfell hall but had deserted it some fifteen years ago for a more modern and commodious mansion in the neighbouring parish
now halford i bid you adieu for the present
this is the first instalment of my debt
if the coin suits you tell me so and ill send you the rest at my leisure if you would rather remain my creditor than stuff your purse with such ungainly heavy piecestell me still and ill pardon your bad taste and willingly keep the treasure to myself
yours immutably gilbert markham
i perceive with joy my most valued friend that the cloud of your displeasure has passed away the light of your countenance blesses me once more and you desire the continuation of my story therefore without more ado you shall have it
i think the day i last mentioned was a certain sunday the latest in the october of
on the following tuesday i was out with my dog and gun in pursuit of such game as i could find within the territory of lindencar but finding none at all i turned my arms against the hawks and carrion crows whose depredations as i suspected had deprived me of better prey
to this end i left the more frequented regions the wooded valleys the cornfields and the meadowlands and proceeded to mount the steep acclivity of wildfell the wildest and the loftiest eminence in our neighbourhood where as you ascend the hedges as well as the trees become scanty and stunted the former at length giving place to rough stone fences partly greened over with ivy and moss the latter to larches and scotch firtrees or isolated blackthorns
the fields being rough and stony and wholly unfit for the plough were mostly devoted to the pasturing of sheep and cattle the soil was thin and poor bits of grey rock here and there peeped out from the grassy hillocks bilberryplants and heatherrelics of more savage wildnessgrew under the walls and in many of the enclosures ragweeds and rushes usurped supremacy over the scanty herbage but these were not my property
near the top of this hill about two miles from lindencar stood wildfell hall a superannuated mansion of the elizabethan era built of dark grey stone venerable and picturesque to look at but doubtless cold and gloomy enough to inhabit with its thick stone mullions and little latticed panes its timeeaten airholes and its too lonely too unsheltered situationonly shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of scotch firs themselves half blighted with storms and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall itself
behind it lay a few desolate fields and then the brown heathclad summit of the hill before it enclosed by stone walls and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey granitesimilar to those which decorated the roof and gablessurmounting the gateposts was a gardenonce stocked with such hard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardeners torturing shears and most readily assume the shapes he chose to give themnow having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed abandoned to the weeds and the grass to the frost and the wind the rain and the drought it presented a very singular appearance indeed
the close green walls of privet that had bordered the principal walk were twothirds withered away and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds the old boxwood swan that sat beside the scraper had lost its neck and half its body the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway and the lion that guarded the other were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth or in the waters under the earth but to my young imagination they presented all of them a goblinish appearance that harmonised well with the ghostly legions and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants
illustration i had succeeded in killing a hawk and two crows when i came within sight of the mansion and then relinquishing further depredations i sauntered on to have a look at the old place and see what changes had been wrought in it by its new inhabitant
i did not like to go quite to the front and stare in at the gate but i paused beside the garden wall and looked and saw no changeexcept in one wing where the broken windows and dilapidated roof had evidently been repaired and where a thin wreath of smoke was curling up from the stack of chimneys
while i thus stood leaning on my gun and looking up at the dark gables sunk in an idle reverie weaving a tissue of wayward fancies in which old associations and the fair young hermit now within those walls bore a nearly equal part i heard a slight rustling and scrambling just within the garden and glancing in the direction whence the sound proceeded i beheld a tiny hand elevated above the wall it clung to the topmost stone and then another little hand was raised to take a firmer hold and then appeared a small white forehead surmounted with wreaths of light brown hair with a pair of deep blue eyes beneath and the upper portion of a diminutive ivory nose
the eyes did not notice me but sparkled with glee on beholding sancho my beautiful black and white setter that was coursing about the field with its muzzle to the ground
the little creature raised its face and called aloud to the dog
the goodnatured animal paused looked up and wagged his tail but made no further advances
the child a little boy apparently about five years old scrambled up to the top of the wall and called again and again but finding this of no avail apparently made up his mind like mahomet to go to the mountain since the mountain would not come to him and attempted to get over but a crabbed old cherrytree that grew hard by caught him by the frock in one of its crooked scraggy arms that stretched over the wall
in attempting to disengage himself his foot slipped and down he tumbledbut not to the earththe tree still kept him suspended
there was a silent struggle and then a piercing shriekbut in an instant i had dropped my gun on the grass and caught the little fellow in my arms
i wiped his eyes with his frock told him he was all right and called sancho to pacify him
he was just putting little hand on the dogs neck and beginning to smile through his tears when i heard behind me a click of the iron gate and a rustle of female garments and lo
mrs graham darted upon meher neck uncovered her black locks streaming in the wind
give me the child she said in a voice scarce louder than a whisper but with a tone of startling vehemence and seizing the boy she snatched him from me as if some dire contamination were in my touch and then stood with one hand firmly clasping his the other on his shoulder fixing upon me her large luminous dark eyespale breathless quivering with agitation
i was not harming the child madam said i scarce knowing whether to be most astonished or displeased he was tumbling off the wall there and i was so fortunate as to catch him while he hung suspended headlong from that tree and prevent i know not what catastrophe i beg your pardon sir stammered shesuddenly calming downthe light of reason seeming to break upon her beclouded spirit and a faint blush mantling on her cheeki did not know youand i thought she stooped to kiss the child and fondly clasped her arm round his neck
you thought i was going to kidnap your son i suppose she stroked his head with a halfembarrassed laugh and repliedi did not know he had attempted to climb the walli have the pleasure of addressing mr markham i believe she added somewhat abruptly
i bowed but ventured to ask how she knew me
your sister called here a few days ago with mrs markham is the resemblance so strong then i asked in some surprise and not so greatly flattered at the idea as i ought to have been
there is a likeness about the eyes and complexion i think replied she somewhat dubiously surveying my faceand i think i saw you at church on sunday i smiledthere was something either in that smile or the recollections it awakened that was particularly displeasing to her for she suddenly assumed again that proud chilly look that had so unspeakably roused my aversion at churcha look of repellent scorn so easily assumed and so entirely without the least distortion of a single feature that while there it seemed like the natural expression of the face and was the more provoking to me because i could not think it affected
goodmorning mr markham said she and without another word or glance she withdrew with her child into the garden and i returned home angry and dissatisfiedi could scarcely tell you why and therefore will not attempt it
i only stayed to put away my gun and powderhorn and give some requisite directions to one of the farmingmen and then repaired to the vicarage to solace my spirit and soothe my ruffled temper with the company and conversation of eliza millward
i found her as usual busy with some piece of soft embroidery the mania for berlin wools had not yet commenced while her sister was seated at the chimneycorner with the cat on her knee mending a heap of stockings
marymary
put them away eliza was hastily saying just as i entered the room
not i indeed was the phlegmatic reply and my appearance prevented further discussion
youre so unfortunate mr markham observed the younger sister with one of her arch sidelong glances
papas just gone out into the parish and not likely to be back for an hour never mind i can manage to spend a few minutes with his daughters if theyll allow me said i bringing a chair to the fire and seating myself therein without waiting to be asked
well if youll be very good and amusing we shall not object let your permission be unconditional pray for i came not to give pleasure but to seek it i answered
however i thought it but reasonable to make some slight exertion to render my company agreeable and what little effort i made was apparently pretty successful for miss eliza was never in a better humour
we seemed indeed to be mutually pleased with each other and managed to maintain between us a cheerful and animated though not very profound conversation
it was little better than a ttette for miss millward never opened her lips except occasionally to correct some random assertion or exaggerated expression of her sisters and once to ask her to pick up the ball of cotton that had rolled under the table
i did this myself however as in duty bound
thank you mr markham said she as i presented it to her
i would have picked it up myself only i did not want to disturb the cat mary dear that wont excuse you in mr markhams eyes said eliza he hates cats i daresay as cordially as he does old maidslike all other gentlemen
dont you mr markham i believe it is natural for our unamiable sex to dislike the creatures replied i for you ladies lavish so many caresses upon them bless themlittle darlings cried she in a sudden burst of enthusiasm turning round and overwhelming her sisters pet with a shower of kisses
dont eliza said miss millward somewhat gruffly as she impatiently pushed her away
but it was time for me to be going make what haste i would i should still be too late for tea and my mother was the soul of order and punctuality
my fair friend was evidently unwilling to bid me adieu
i tenderly squeezed her little hand at parting and she repaid me with one of her softest smiles and most bewitching glances
i went home very happy with a heart brimful of complacency for myself and overflowing with love for eliza
two days after mrs graham called at lindencar contrary to the expectation of rose who entertained an idea that the mysterious occupant of wildfell hall would wholly disregard the common observances of civilized lifein which opinion she was supported by the wilsons who testified that neither their call nor the millwards had been returned as yet
now however the cause of that omission was explained though not entirely to the satisfaction of rose
mrs graham had brought her child with her and on my mothers expressing surprise that he could walk so far she repliedit is a long walk for him but i must have either taken him with me or relinquished the visit altogether for i never leave him alone and i think mrs markham i must beg you to make my excuses to the millwards and mrs wilson when you see them as i fear i cannot do myself the pleasure of calling upon them till my little arthur is able to accompany me but you have a servant said rose could you not leave him with her she has her own occupations to attend to and besides she is too old to run after a child and he is too mercurial to be tied to an elderly woman but you left him to come to church yes once but i would not have left him for any other purpose and i think in future i must contrive to bring him with me or stay at home is he so mischievous asked my mother considerably shocked
no replied the lady sadly smiling as she stroked the wavy locks of her son who was seated on a low stool at her feet but he is my only treasure and i am his only friend so we dont like to be separated but my dear i call that doting said my plainspoken parent
you should try to suppress such foolish fondness as well to save your son from ruin as yourself from ridicule ruin mrs markham yes it is spoiling the child
even at his age he ought not to be always tied to his mothers apronstring he should learn to be ashamed of it mrs
markham i beg you will not say such things in his presence at least
i trust my son will never be ashamed to love his mother said mrs graham with a serious energy that startled the company
my mother attempted to appease her by an explanation but she seemed to think enough had been said on the subject and abruptly turned the conversation
just as i thought said i to myself the ladys temper is none of the mildest notwithstanding her sweet pale face and lofty brow where thought and suffering seem equally to have stamped their impress all this time i was seated at a table on the other side of the room apparently immersed in the perusal of a volume of the farmers magazine which i happened to have been reading at the moment of our visitors arrival and not choosing to be over civil i had merely bowed as she entered and continued my occupation as before
in a little while however i was sensible that some one was approaching me with a light but slow and hesitating tread
it was little arthur irresistibly attracted by my dog sancho that was lying at my feet
on looking up i beheld him standing about two yards off with his clear blue eyes wistfully gazing on the dog transfixed to the spot not by fear of the animal but by a timid disinclination to approach its master
a little encouragement however induced him to come forward
the child though shy was not sullen
in a minute he was kneeling on the carpet with his arms round sanchos neck and in a minute or two more the little fellow was seated on my knee surveying with eager interest the various specimens of horses cattle pigs and model farms portrayed in the volume before me
i glanced at his mother now and then to see how she relished the newsprung intimacy and i saw by the unquiet aspect of her eye that for some reason or other she was uneasy at the childs position
arthur said she at length come here
you are troublesome to mr markham he wishes to read by no means mrs graham pray let him stay
i am as much amused as he is pleaded i
but still with hand and eye she silently called him to her side
no mamma said the child let me look at these pictures first and then ill come and tell you all about them we are going to have a small party on monday the fifth of november said my mother and i hope you will not refuse to make one mrs graham
you can bring your little boy with you you knowi daresay we shall be able to amuse himand then you can make your own apologies to the millwards and wilsonsthey will all be here i expect thank you i never go to parties oh
but this will be quite a family concernearly hours and nobody here but ourselves and just the millwards and wilsons most of whom you already know and mr lawrence your landlord with whom you ought to make acquaintance i do know something of himbut you must excuse me this time for the evenings now are dark and damp and arthur i fear is too delicate to risk exposure to their influence with impunity
we must defer the enjoyment of your hospitality till the return of longer days and warmer nights rose now at a hint from my mother produced a decanter of wine with accompaniments of glasses and cake from the cupboard and the oak sideboard and the refreshment was duly presented to the guests
they both partook of the cake but obstinately refused the wine in spite of their hostesss hospitable attempts to force it upon them
arthur especially shrank from the ruby nectar as if in terror and disgust and was ready to cry when urged to take it
never mind arthur said his mamma mrs
markham thinks it will do you good as you were tired with your walk but she will not oblige you to take iti daresay you will do very well without
he detests the very sight of wine she added and the smell of it almost makes him sick
i have been accustomed to make him swallow a little wine or weak spiritsandwater by way of medicine when he was sick and in fact i have done what i could to make him hate them everybody laughed except the young widow and her son
well mrs graham said my mother wiping the tears of merriment from her bright blue eyeswell you surprise me
i really gave you credit for having more sensethe poor child will be the veriest milksop that ever was sopped
only think what a man you will make of him if you persist in i think it a very excellent plan interrupted mrs graham with imperturbable gravity
by that means i hope to save him from one degrading vice at least
i wish i could render the incentives to every other equally innoxious in his case but by such means said i you will never render him virtuouswhat is it that constitutes virtue mrs graham
is it the circumstance of being able and willing to resist temptation or that of having no temptations to resistis he a strong man that overcomes great obstacles and performs surprising achievements though by dint of great muscular exertion and at the risk of some subsequent fatigue or he that sits in his chair all day with nothing to do more laborious than stirring the fire and carrying his food to his mouth
if you would have your son to walk honourably through the world you must not attempt to clear the stones from his path but teach him to walk firmly over themnot insist upon leading him by the hand but let him learn to go alone i will lead him by the hand mr markham till he has strength to go alone and i will clear as many stones from his path as i can and teach him to avoid the restor walk firmly over them as you sayfor when i have done my utmost in the way of clearance there will still be plenty left to exercise all the agility steadiness and circumspection he will ever haveit is all very well to talk about noble resistance and trials of virtue but for fiftyor five hundred men that have yielded to temptation show me one that has had virtue to resist
and why should i take it for granted that my son will be one in a thousandand not rather prepare for the worst and suppose he will be like hislike the rest of mankind unless i take care to prevent it you are very complimentary to us all i observed
i know nothing about youi speak of those i do knowand when i see the whole race of mankind with a few rare exceptions stumbling and blundering along the path of life sinking into every pitfall and breaking their shins over every impediment that lies in their way shall i not use all the means in my power to insure for him a smoother and a safer passage yes but the surest means will be to endeavour to fortify him against temptation not to remove it out of his way i will do both mr markham
god knows he will have temptations enough to assail him both from within and without when i have done all i can to render vice as uninviting to him as it is abominable in its own naturei myself have had indeed but few incentives to what the world calls vice but yet i have experienced temptations and trials of another kind that have required on many occasions more watchfulness and firmness to resist than i have hitherto been able to muster against them
and this i believe is what most others would acknowledge who are accustomed to reflection and wishful to strive against their natural corruptions yes said my mother but half apprehending her drift but you would not judge of a boy by yourselfand my dear mrs graham let me warn you in good time against the errorthe fatal error i may call itof taking that boys education upon yourself
because you are clever in some things and well informed you may fancy yourself equal to the task but indeed you are not and if you persist in the attempt believe me you will bitterly repent it when the mischief is done i am to send him to school i suppose to learn to despise his mothers authority and affection said the lady with rather a bitter smile
oh nobut if you would have a boy to despise his mother let her keep him at home and spend her life in petting him up and slaving to indulge his follies and caprices i perfectly agree with you mrs markham but nothing can be further from my principles and practice than such criminal weakness as that well but you will treat him like a girlyoull spoil his spirit and make a mere miss nancy of himyou will indeed mrs graham whatever you may think
but ill get mr millward to talk to you about ithell tell you the consequenceshell set it before you as plain as the dayand tell you what you ought to do and all about itand i dont doubt hell be able to convince you in a minute no occasion to trouble the vicar said mrs graham glancing at mei suppose i was smiling at my mothers unbounded confidence in that worthy gentlemanmr
markham here thinks his powers of conviction at least equal to mr millwards
if i hear not him neither should i be convinced though one rose from the dead he would tell you
well mr markham you that maintain that a boy should not be shielded from evil but sent out to battle against it alone and unassistednot taught to avoid the snares of life but boldly to rush into them or over them as he mayto seek danger rather than shun it and feed his virtue by temptationwould you i beg your pardon mrs grahambut you get on too fast
i have not yet said that a boy should be taught to rush into the snares of lifeor even wilfully to seek temptation for the sake of exercising his virtue by overcoming iti only say that it is better to arm and strengthen your hero than to disarm and enfeeble the foeand if you were to rear an oak sapling in a hothouse tending it carefully night and day and shielding it from every breath of wind you could not expect it to become a hardy tree like that which has grown up on the mountainside exposed to all the action of the elements and not even sheltered from the shock of the tempest grantedbut would you use the same argument with regard to a girl certainly not no you would have her to be tenderly and delicately nurtured like a hothouse planttaught to cling to others for direction and support and guarded as much as possible from the very knowledge of evil
but will you be so good as to inform me why you make this distinction
is it that you think she has no virtue assuredly not well but you affirm that virtue is only elicited by temptationand you think that a woman cannot be too little exposed to temptation or too little acquainted with vice or anything connected therewith
it must be either that you think she is essentially so vicious or so feebleminded that she cannot withstand temptationand though she may be pure and innocent as long as she is kept in ignorance and restraint yet being destitute of real virtue to teach her how to sin is at once to make her a sinner and the greater her knowledge the wider her liberty the deeper will be her depravitywhereas in the nobler sex there is a natural tendency to goodness guarded by a superior fortitude which the more it is exercised by trials and dangers is only the further developed heaven forbid that i should think so i interrupted her at last
well then it must be that you think they are both weak and prone to err and the slightest error the merest shadow of pollution will ruin the one while the character of the other will be strengthened and embellishedhis education properly finished by a little practical acquaintance with forbidden things
such experience to him to use a trite simile will be like the storm to the oak which though it may scatter the leaves and snap the smaller branches serves but to rivet the roots and to harden and condense the fibres of the tree
you would have us encourage our sons to prove all things by their own experience while our daughters must not even profit by the experience of others
now i would have both so to benefit by the experience of others and the precepts of a higher authority that they should know beforehand to refuse the evil and choose the good and require no experimental proofs to teach them the evil of transgression
i would not send a poor girl into the world unarmed against her foes and ignorant of the snares that beset her path nor would i watch and guard her till deprived of selfrespect and selfreliance she lost the power or the will to watch and guard herselfand as for my sonif i thought he would grow up to be what you call a man of the worldone that has seen life and glories in his experience even though he should so far profit by it as to sober down at length into a useful and respected member of societyi would rather that he died tomorrowrather a thousand times she earnestly repeated pressing her darling to her side and kissing his forehead with intense affection
he had already left his new companion and been standing for some time beside his mothers knee looking up into her face and listening in silent wonder to her incomprehensible discourse
well
you ladies must always have the last word i suppose said i observing her rise and begin to take leave of my mother
you may have as many words as you pleaseonly i cant stay to hear them no that is the way you hear just as much of an argument as you please and the rest may be spoken to the wind if you are anxious to say anything more on the subject replied she as she shook hands with rose you must bring your sister to see me some fine day and ill listen as patiently as you could wish to whatever you please to say
i would rather be lectured by you than the vicar because i should have less remorse in telling you at the end of the discourse that i preserve my own opinion precisely the same as at the beginningas would be the case i am persuaded with regard to either logician yes of course replied i determined to be as provoking as herself for when a lady does consent to listen to an argument against her own opinions she is always predetermined to withstand itto listen only with her bodily ears keeping the mental organs resolutely closed against the strongest reasoning goodmorning mr markham said my fair antagonist with a pitying smile and deigning no further rejoinder she slightly bowed and was about to withdraw but her son with childish impertinence arrested her by exclaimingmamma you have not shaken hands with mr markham she laughingly turned round and held out her hand
i gave it a spiteful squeeze for i was annoyed at the continual injustice she had done me from the very dawn of our acquaintance
without knowing anything about my real disposition and principles she was evidently prejudiced against me and seemed bent upon showing me that her opinions respecting me on every particular fell far below those i entertained of myself
i was naturally touchy or it would not have vexed me so much
perhaps too i was a little bit spoiled by my mother and sister and some other ladies of my acquaintanceand yet i was by no means a fopof that i am fully convinced whether you are or not
our party on the th of november passed off very well in spite of mrs grahams refusal to grace it with her presence
indeed it is probable that had she been there there would have been less cordiality freedom and frolic amongst us than there was without her
my mother as usual was cheerful and chatty full of activity and goodnature and only faulty in being too anxious to make her guests happy thereby forcing several of them to do what their soul abhorred in the way of eating or drinking sitting opposite the blazing fire or talking when they would be silent
nevertheless they bore it very well being all in their holiday humours
mr millward was mighty in important dogmas and sententious jokes pompous anecdotes and oracular discourses dealt out for the edification of the whole assembly in general and of the admiring mrs markham the polite mr lawrence the sedate mary millward the quiet richard wilson and the matteroffact robert in particularas being the most attentive listeners
mrs wilson was more brilliant than ever with her budgets of fresh news and old scandal strung together with trivial questions and remarks and oftrepeated observations uttered apparently for the sole purpose of denying a moments rest to her inexhaustible organs of speech
she had brought her knitting with her and it seemed as if her tongue had laid a wager with her fingers to outdo them in swift and ceaseless motion
her daughter jane was of course as graceful and elegant as witty and seductive as she could possibly manage to be for here were all the ladies to outshine and all the gentlemen to charmand mr lawrence especially to capture and subdue
her little arts to effect his subjugation were too subtle and impalpable to attract my observation but i thought there was a certain refined affectation of superiority and an ungenial selfconsciousness about her that negatived all her advantages and after she was gone rose interpreted to me her various looks words and actions with a mingled acuteness and asperity that made me wonder equally at the ladys artifice and my sisters penetration and ask myself if she too had an eye to the squirebut never mind halford she had not
richard wilson janes younger brother sat in a corner apparently goodtempered but silent and shy desirous to escape observation but willing enough to listen and observe and although somewhat out of his element he would have been happy enough in his own quiet way if my mother could only have let him alone but in her mistaken kindness she would keep persecuting him with her attentionspressing upon him all manner of viands under the notion that he was too bashful to help himself and obliging him to shout across the room his monosyllabic replies to the numerous questions and observations by which she vainly attempted to draw him into conversation
rose informed me that he never would have favoured us with his company but for the importunities of his sister jane who was most anxious to show mr lawrence that she had at least one brother more gentlemanly and refined than robert
that worthy individual she had been equally solicitous to keep away but he affirmed that he saw no reason why he should not enjoy a crack with markham and the old lady my mother was not old really and bonny miss rose and the parson as well as the bestand he was in the right of it too
so he talked commonplace with my mother and rose and discussed parish affairs with the vicar farming matters with me and politics with us both
mary millward was another mutenot so much tormented with cruel kindness as dick wilson because she had a certain short decided way of answering and refusing and was supposed to be rather sullen than diffident
however that might be she certainly did not give much pleasure to the companynor did she appear to derive much from it
eliza told me she had only come because her father insisted upon it having taken it into his head that she devoted herself too exclusively to her household duties to the neglect of such relaxations and innocent enjoyments as were proper to her age and sex
she seemed to me to be goodhumoured enough on the whole
once or twice she was provoked to laughter by the wit or the merriment of some favoured individual amongst us and then i observed she sought the eye of richard wilson who sat over against her
as he studied with her father she had some acquaintance with him in spite of the retiring habits of both and i suppose there was a kind of fellowfeeling established between them
my eliza was charming beyond description coquettish without affectation and evidently more desirous to engage my attention than that of all the room besides
her delight in having me near her seated or standing by her side whispering in her ear or pressing her hand in the dance was plainly legible in her glowing face and heaving bosom however belied by saucy words and gestures
but i had better hold my tongue if i boast of these things now i shall have to blush hereafter
to proceed then with the various individuals of our party rose was simple and natural as usual and full of mirth and vivacity
fergus was impertinent and absurd but his impertinence and folly served to make others laugh if they did not raise himself in their estimation
and finally for i omit myself mr lawrence was gentlemanly and inoffensive to all and polite to the vicar and the ladies especially his hostess and her daughter and miss wilsonmisguided man he had not the taste to prefer eliza millward
mr lawrence and i were on tolerably intimate terms
essentially of reserved habits and but seldom quitting the secluded place of his birth where he had lived in solitary state since the death of his father he had neither the opportunity nor the inclination for forming many acquaintances and of all he had ever known i judging by the results was the companion most agreeable to his taste
i liked the man well enough but he was too cold and shy and selfcontained to obtain my cordial sympathies
a spirit of candour and frankness when wholly unaccompanied with coarseness he admired in others but he could not acquire it himself
his excessive reserve upon all his own concerns was indeed provoking and chilly enough but i forgave it from a conviction that it originated less in pride and want of confidence in his friends than in a certain morbid feeling of delicacy and a peculiar diffidence that he was sensible of but wanted energy to overcome
his heart was like a sensitive plant that opens for a moment in the sunshine but curls up and shrinks into itself at the slightest touch of the finger or the lightest breath of wind
and upon the whole our intimacy was rather a mutual predilection than a deep and solid friendship such as has since arisen between myself and you halford whom in spite of your occasional crustiness i can liken to nothing so well as an old coat unimpeachable in texture but easy and loosethat has conformed itself to the shape of the wearer and which he may use as he pleases without being bothered with the fear of spoiling itwhereas mr lawrence was like a new garment all very neat and trim to look at but so tight in the elbows that you would fear to split the seams by the unrestricted motion of your arms and so smooth and fine in surface that you scruple to expose it to a single drop of rain
soon after the arrival of the guests my mother mentioned mrs graham regretted she was not there to meet them and explained to the millwards and wilsons the reasons she had given for neglecting to return their calls hoping they would excuse her as she was sure she did not mean to be uncivil and would be glad to see them at any timebut she is a very singular lady mr lawrence added she we dont know what to make of herbut i daresay you can tell us something about her for she is your tenant you knowand she said she knew you a little all eyes were turned to mr lawrence
i thought he looked unnecessarily confused at being so appealed to
i mrs markham said he you are mistakeni dontthat isi have seen her certainly but i am the last person you should apply to for information respecting mrs graham he then immediately turned to rose and asked her to favour the company with a song or a tune on the piano
no said she you must ask miss wilson she outshines us all in singing and music too miss wilson demurred
shell sing readily enough said fergus if youll undertake to stand by her mr lawrence and turn over the leaves for her i shall be most happy to do so miss wilson will you allow me she bridled her long neck and smiled and suffered him to lead her to the instrument where she played and sang in her very best style one piece after another while he stood patiently by leaning one hand on the back of her chair and turning over the leaves of her book with the other
perhaps he was as much charmed with her performance as she was
it was all very fine in its way but i cannot say that it moved me very deeply
there was plenty of skill and execution but precious little feeling
but we had not done with mrs graham yet
i dont take wine mrs markham said mr millward upon the introduction of that beverage ill take a little of your homebrewed ale
i always prefer your homebrewed to anything else flattered at this compliment my mother rang the bell and a china jug of our best ale was presently brought and set before the worthy gentleman who so well knew how to appreciate its excellences
now this is the thing cried he pouring out a glass of the same in a long stream skilfully directed from the jug to the tumbler so as to produce much foam without spilling a drop and having surveyed it for a moment opposite the candle he took a deep draught and then smacked his lips drew a long breath and refilled his glass my mother looking on with the greatest satisfaction
theres nothing like this mrs markham said he
i always maintain that theres nothing to compare with your homebrewed ale im sure im glad you like it sir
i always look after the brewing myself as well as the cheese and the butteri like to have things well done while were about it quite right mrs markham but then mr millward you dont think it wrong to take a little wine now and thenor a little spirits either said my mother as she handed a smoking tumbler of ginandwater to mrs wilson who affirmed that wine sat heavy on her stomach and whose son robert was at that moment helping himself to a pretty stiff glass of the same
by no means replied the oracle with a jovelike nod these things are all blessings and mercies if we only knew how to make use of them but mrs graham doesnt think so
you shall just hear now what she told us the other dayi told her id tell you and my mother favoured the company with a particular account of that ladys mistaken ideas and conduct regarding the matter in hand concluding with now dont you think it is wrong wrong repeated the vicar with more than common solemnitycriminal i should saycriminal
not only is it making a fool of the boy but it is despising the gifts of providence and teaching him to trample them under his feet he then entered more fully into the question and explained at large the folly and impiety of such a proceeding
my mother heard him with profoundest reverence and even mrs wilson vouchsafed to rest her tongue for a moment and listen in silence while she complacently sipped her ginandwater
mr lawrence sat with his elbow on the table carelessly playing with his halfempty wineglass and covertly smiling to himself
but dont you think mr millward suggested he when at length that gentleman paused in his discourse that when a child may be naturally prone to intemperanceby the fault of its parents or ancestors for instancesome precautions are advisable now it was generally believed that mr lawrences father had shortened his days by intemperance
some precautions it may be but temperance sir is one thing and abstinence another but i have heard that with some persons temperancethat is moderationis almost impossible and if abstinence be an evil which some have doubted no one will deny that excess is a greater
some parents have entirely prohibited their children from tasting intoxicating liquors but a parents authority cannot last for ever children are naturally prone to hanker after forbidden things and a child in such a case would be likely to have a strong curiosity to taste and try the effect of what has been so lauded and enjoyed by others so strictly forbidden to himselfwhich curiosity would generally be gratified on the first convenient opportunity and the restraint once broken serious consequences might ensue
i dont pretend to be a judge of such matters but it seems to me that this plan of mrs grahams as you describe it mrs markham extraordinary as it may be is not without its advantages for here you see the child is delivered at once from temptation he has no secret curiosity no hankering desire he is as well acquainted with the tempting liquors as he ever wishes to be and is thoroughly disgusted with them without having suffered from their effects and is that right sir
have i not proven to you how wrong it ishow contrary to scripture and to reason to teach a child to look with contempt and disgust upon the blessings of providence instead of to use them aright you may consider laudanum a blessing of providence sir replied mr lawrence smiling and yet you will allow that most of us had better abstain from it even in moderation but added he i would not desire you to follow out my simile too closelyin witness whereof i finish my glass and take another i hope mr lawrence said my mother pushing the bottle towards him
he politely declined and pushing his chair a little away from the table leant back towards mei was seated a trifle behind on the sofa beside eliza millwardand carelessly asked me if i knew mrs graham
i have met her once or twice i replied
what do you think of her i cannot say that i like her much
she is handsomeor rather i should say distinguished and interestingin her appearance but by no means amiablea woman liable to take strong prejudices i should fancy and stick to them through thick and thin twisting everything into conformity with her own preconceived opinionstoo hard too sharp too bitter for my taste he made no reply but looked down and bit his lip and shortly after rose and sauntered up to miss wilson as much repelled by me i fancy as attracted by her
i scarcely noticed it at the time but afterwards i was led to recall this and other trifling facts of a similar nature to my remembrance whenbut i must not anticipate
we wound up the evening with dancingour worthy pastor thinking it no scandal to be present on the occasion though one of the village musicians was engaged to direct our evolutions with his violin
but mary millward obstinately refused to join us and so did richard wilson though my mother earnestly entreated him to do so and even offered to be his partner
we managed very well without them however
with a single set of quadrilles and several country dances we carried it on to a pretty late hour and at length having called upon our musician to strike up a waltz i was just about to whirl eliza round in that delightful dance accompanied by lawrence and jane wilson and fergus and rose when mr millward interposed withno no i dont allow that
come its time to be going now oh no papa pleaded eliza
high time my girlhigh time
moderation in all things remember
thats the planlet your moderation be known unto all men but in revenge i followed eliza into the dimlylighted passage where under pretence of helping her on with her shawl i fear i must plead guilty to snatching a kiss behind her fathers back while he was enveloping his throat and chin in the folds of a mighty comforter
but alas
in turning round there was my mother close beside me
the consequence was that no sooner were the guests departed than i was doomed to a very serious remonstrance which unpleasantly checked the galloping course of my spirits and made a disagreeable close to the evening
my dear gilbert said she i wish you wouldnt do so
you know how deeply i have your advantage at heart how i love you and prize you above everything else in the world and how much i long to see you well settled in lifeand how bitterly it would grieve me to see you married to that girlor any other in the neighbourhood
what you see in her i dont know
it isnt only the want of money that i think aboutnothing of the kindbut theres neither beauty nor cleverness nor goodness nor anything else thats desirable
if you knew your own value as i do you wouldnt dream of it
do wait awhile and see
if you bind yourself to her youll repent it all your lifetime when you look round and see how many better there are
take my word for it you will well mother do be quieti hate to be lecturedim not going to marry yet i tell you butdear me
maynt i enjoy myself at all yes my dear boy but not in that way
indeed you shouldnt do such things
you would be wronging the girl if she were what she ought to be but i assure you she is as artful a little hussy as anybody need wish to see and youll get entangled in her snares before you know where you are
and if you do marry her gilbert youll break my heartso theres an end of it well dont cry about it mother said i for the tears were gushing from her eyes there let that kiss efface the one i gave eliza dont abuse her any more and set your mind at rest for ill promise neverthat is ill promise to think twice before i take any important step you seriously disapprove of so saying i lighted my candle and went to bed considerably quenched in spirit
it was about the close of the month that yielding at length to the urgent importunities of rose i accompanied her in a visit to wildfell hall
to our surprise we were ushered into a room where the first object that met the eye was a painters easel with a table beside it covered with rolls of canvas bottles of oil and varnish palette brushes paints c leaning against the wall were several sketches in various stages of progression and a few finished paintingsmostly of landscapes and figures
i must make you welcome to my studio said mrs graham there is no fire in the sittingroom today and it is rather too cold to show you into a place with an empty grate and disengaging a couple of chairs from the artistical lumber that usurped them she bid us be seated and resumed her place beside the easelnot facing it exactly but now and then glancing at the picture upon it while she conversed and giving it an occasional touch with her brush as if she found it impossible to wean her attention entirely from her occupation to fix it upon her guests
it was a view of wildfell hall as seen at early morning from the field below rising in dark relief against a sky of clear silvery blue with a few red streaks on the horizon faithfully drawn and coloured and very elegantly and artistically handled
i see your heart is in your work mrs graham observed i i must beg you to go on with it for if you suffer our presence to interrupt you we shall be constrained to regard ourselves as unwelcome intruders oh no replied she throwing her brush on to the table as if startled into politeness
i am not so beset with visitors but that i can readily spare a few minutes to the few that do favour me with their company you have almost completed your painting said i approaching to observe it more closely and surveying it with a greater degree of admiration and delight than i cared to express
a few more touches in the foreground will finish it i should think
but why have you called it fernley manor cumberland instead of wildfell hall shire i asked alluding to the name she had traced in small characters at the bottom of the canvas
but immediately i was sensible of having committed an act of impertinence in so doing for she coloured and hesitated but after a moments pause with a kind of desperate frankness she replied because i have friendsacquaintances at leastin the world from whom i desire my present abode to be concealed and as they might see the picture and might possibly recognise the style in spite of the false initials i have put in the corner i take the precaution to give a false name to the place also in order to put them on a wrong scent if they should attempt to trace me out by it then you dont intend to keep the picture said i anxious to say anything to change the subject
no i cannot afford to paint for my own amusement mamma sends all her pictures to london said arthur and somebody sells them for her there and sends us the money in looking round upon the other pieces i remarked a pretty sketch of lindenhope from the top of the hill another view of the old hall basking in the sunny haze of a quiet summer afternoon and a simple but striking little picture of a child brooding with looks of silent but deep and sorrowful regret over a handful of withered flowers with glimpses of dark low hills and autumnal fields behind it and a dull beclouded sky above
you see there is a sad dearth of subjects observed the fair artist
i took the old hall once on a moonlight night and i suppose i must take it again on a snowy winters day and then again on a dark cloudy evening for i really have nothing else to paint
i have been told that you have a fine view of the sea somewhere in the neighbourhood
is it trueand is it within walking distance yes if you dont object to walking four milesor nearly solittle short of eight miles there and backand over a somewhat rough fatiguing road in what direction does it lie i described the situation as well as i could and was entering upon an explanation of the various roads lanes and fields to be traversed in order to reach it the goings straight on and turnings to the right and the left when she checked me with oh stop
dont tell me now i shall forget every word of your directions before i require them
i shall not think about going till next spring and then perhaps i may trouble you
at present we have the winter before us and she suddenly paused with a suppressed exclamation started up from her seat and saying excuse me one moment hurried from the room and shut the door behind her
curious to see what had startled her so i looked towards the windowfor her eyes had been carelessly fixed upon it the moment beforeand just beheld the skirts of a mans coat vanishing behind a large hollybush that stood between the window and the porch
its mammas friend said arthur
rose and i looked at each other
i dont know what to make of her at all whispered rose
the child looked at her in grave surprise
she straightway began to talk to him on indifferent matters while i amused myself with looking at the pictures
there was one in an obscure corner that i had not before observed
it was a little child seated on the grass with its lap full of flowers
the tiny features and large blue eyes smiling through a shock of light brown curls shaken over the forehead as it bent above its treasure bore sufficient resemblance to those of the young gentleman before me to proclaim it a portrait of arthur graham in his early infancy
in taking this up to bring it to the light i discovered another behind it with its face to the wall
i ventured to take that up too
it was the portrait of a gentleman in the full prime of youthful manhoodhandsome enough and not badly executed but if done by the same hand as the others it was evidently some years before for there was far more careful minuteness of detail and less of that freshness of colouring and freedom of handling that delighted and surprised me in them
nevertheless i surveyed it with considerable interest
there was a certain individuality in the features and expression that stamped it at once a successful likeness
the bright blue eyes regarded the spectator with a kind of lurking drolleryyou almost expected to see them wink the lipsa little too voluptuously fullseemed ready to break into a smile the warmlytinted cheeks were embellished with a luxuriant growth of reddish whiskers while the bright chestnut hair clustering in abundant wavy curls trespassed too much upon the forehead and seemed to intimate that the owner thereof was prouder of his beauty than his intellectas perhaps he had reason to be and yet he looked no fool
i had not had the portrait in my hands two minutes before the fair artist returned
only some one come about the pictures said she in apology for her abrupt departure i told him to wait i fear it will be considered an act of impertinence i said to presume to look at a picture that the artist has turned to the wall but may i ask it is an act of very great impertinence sir and therefore i beg you will ask nothing about it for your curiosity will not be gratified replied she attempting to cover the tartness of her rebuke with a smile but i could see by her flushed cheek and kindling eye that she was seriously annoyed
i was only going to ask if you had painted it yourself said i sulkily resigning the picture into her hands for without a grain of ceremony she took it from me and quickly restoring it to the dark corner with its face to the wall placed the other against it as before and then turned to me and laughed
but i was in no humour for jesting
i carelessly turned to the window and stood looking out upon the desolate garden leaving her to talk to rose for a minute or two and then telling my sister it was time to go shook hands with the little gentleman coolly bowed to the lady and moved towards the door
but having bid adieu to rose mrs graham presented her hand to me saying with a soft voice and by no means a disagreeable smilelet not the sun go down upon your wrath mr markham
im sorry i offended you by my abruptness when a lady condescends to apologise there is no keeping ones anger of course so we parted good friends for once and this time i squeezed her hand with a cordial not a spiteful pressure
during the next four months i did not enter mrs grahams house nor she mine but still the ladies continued to talk about her and still our acquaintance continued though slowly to advance
as for their talk i paid but little attention to that when it related to the fair hermit i mean and the only information i derived from it was that one fine frosty day she had ventured to take her little boy as far as the vicarage and that unfortunately nobody was at home but miss millward nevertheless she had sat a long time and by all accounts they had found a good deal to say to each other and parted with a mutual desire to meet again
but mary liked children and fond mammas like those who can duly appreciate their treasures
but sometimes i saw her myself not only when she came to church but when she was out on the hills with her son whether taking a long purposelike walk oron special fine daysleisurely rambling over the moor or the bleak pasturelands surrounding the old hall herself with a book in her hand her son gambolling about her and on any of these occasions when i caught sight of her in my solitary walks or rides or while following my agricultural pursuits i generally contrived to meet or overtake her for i rather liked to see mrs graham and to talk to her and i decidedly liked to talk to her little companion whom when once the ice of his shyness was fairly broken i found to be a very amiable intelligent and entertaining little fellow and we soon became excellent friendshow much to the gratification of his mamma i cannot undertake to say
i suspected at first that she was desirous of throwing cold water on this growing intimacyto quench as it were the kindling flame of our friendshipbut discovering at length in spite of her prejudice against me that i was perfectly harmless and even wellintentioned and that between myself and my dog her son derived a great deal of pleasure from the acquaintance that he would not otherwise have known she ceased to object and even welcomed my coming with a smile
as for arthur he would shout his welcome from afar and run to meet me fifty yards from his mothers side
if i happened to be on horseback he was sure to get a canter or a gallop or if there was one of the draught horses within an available distance he was treated to a steady ride upon that which served his turn almost as well but his mother would always follow and trudge beside himnot so much i believe to ensure his safe conduct as to see that i instilled no objectionable notions into his infant mind for she was ever on the watch and never would allow him to be taken out of her sight
what pleased her best of all was to see him romping and racing with sancho while i walked by her sidenot i fear for love of my company though i sometimes deluded myself with that idea so much as for the delight she took in seeing her son thus happily engaged in the enjoyment of those active sports so invigorating to his tender frame yet so seldom exercised for want of playmates suited to his years and perhaps her pleasure was sweetened not a little by the fact of my being with her instead of with him and therefore incapable of doing him any injury directly or indirectly designedly or otherwise small thanks to her for that same
but sometimes i believe she really had some little gratification in conversing with me and one bright february morning during twenty minutes stroll along the moor she laid aside her usual asperity and reserve and fairly entered into conversation with me discoursing with so much eloquence and depth of thought and feeling on a subject happily coinciding with my own ideas and looking so beautiful withal that i went home enchanted and on the way morally started to find myself thinking that after all it would perhaps be better to spend ones days with such a woman than with eliza millward and then i figuratively blushed for my inconstancy
on entering the parlour i found eliza there with rose and no one else
the surprise was not altogether so agreeable as it ought to have been
we chatted together a long time but i found her rather frivolous and even a little insipid compared with the more mature and earnest mrs graham
alas for human constancy
however thought i i ought not to marry eliza since my mother so strongly objects to it and i ought not to delude the girl with the idea that i intended to do so
now if this mood continue i shall have less difficulty in emancipating my affections from her soft yet unrelenting sway and though mrs graham might be equally objectionable i may be permitted like the doctors to cure a greater evil by a less for i shall not fall seriously in love with the young widow i think nor she with methats certainbut if i find a little pleasure in her society i may surely be allowed to seek it and if the star of her divinity be bright enough to dim the lustre of elizas so much the better but i scarcely can think it and thereafter i seldom suffered a fine day to pass without paying a visit to wildfell about the time my new acquaintance usually left her hermitage but so frequently was i baulked in my expectations of another interview so changeable was she in her times of coming forth and in her places of resort so transient were the occasional glimpses i was able to obtain that i felt half inclined to think she took as much pains to avoid my company as i to seek hers but this was too disagreeable a supposition to be entertained a moment after it could conveniently be dismissed
one calm clear afternoon however in march as i was superintending the rolling of the meadowland and the repairing of a hedge in the valley i saw mrs graham down by the brook with a sketchbook in her hand absorbed in the exercise of her favourite art while arthur was putting on the time with constructing dams and breakwaters in the shallow stony stream
i was rather in want of amusement and so rare an opportunity was not to be neglected so leaving both meadow and hedge i quickly repaired to the spot but not before sancho who immediately upon perceiving his young friend scoured at full gallop the intervening space and pounced upon him with an impetuous mirth that precipitated the child almost into the middle of the beck but happily the stones preserved him from any serious wetting while their smoothness prevented his being too much hurt to laugh at the untoward event
mrs graham was studying the distinctive characters of the different varieties of trees in their winter nakedness and copying with a spirited though delicate touch their various ramifications
she did not talk much but i stood and watched the progress of her pencil it was a pleasure to behold it so dexterously guided by those fair and graceful fingers
but ere long their dexterity became impaired they began to hesitate to tremble slightly and make false strokes and then suddenly came to a pause while their owner laughingly raised her face to mine and told me that her sketch did not profit by my superintendence
then said i ill talk to arthur till youve done i should like to have a ride mr markham if mamma will let me said the child
what on my boy i think theres a horse in that field replied he pointing to where the strong black mare was pulling the roller
no no arthur its too far objected his mother
but i promised to bring him safe back after a turn or two up and down the meadow and when she looked at his eager face she smiled and let him go
it was the first time she had even allowed me to take him so much as half a fields length from her side
illustration enthroned upon his monstrous steed and solemnly proceeding up and down the wide steep field he looked the very incarnation of quiet gleeful satisfaction and delight
the rolling however was soon completed but when i dismounted the gallant horseman and restored him to his mother she seemed rather displeased at my keeping him so long
she had shut up her sketchbook and been probably for some minutes impatiently waiting his return
it was now high time to go home she said and would have bid me goodevening but i was not going to leave her yet i accompanied her halfway up the hill
she became more sociable and i was beginning to be very happy but on coming within sight of the grim old hall she stood still and turned towards me while she spoke as if expecting i should go no further that the conversation would end here and i should now take leave and departas indeed it was time to do for the clear cold eve was fast declining the sun had set and the gibbous moon was visibly brightening in the pale grey sky but a feeling almost of compassion riveted me to the spot
it seemed hard to leave her to such a lonely comfortless home
i looked up at it
silent and grim it frowned before us
a faint red light was gleaming from the lower windows of one wing but all the other windows were in darkness and many exhibited their black cavernous gulfs entirely destitute of glazing or framework
do you not find it a desolate place to live in said i after a moment of silent contemplation
i do sometimes replied she
on winter evenings when arthur is in bed and i am sitting there alone hearing the bleak wind moaning round me and howling through the ruinous old chambers no books or occupations can repress the dismal thoughts and apprehensions that come crowding inbut it is folly to give way to such weakness i know
if rachel is satisfied with such a life why should not iindeed i cannot be too thankful for such an asylum while it is left me the closing sentence was uttered in an undertone as if spoken rather to herself than to me
she then bid me goodevening and withdrew
i had not proceeded many steps on my way homewards when i perceived mr lawrence on his pretty grey pony coming up the rugged lane that crossed over the hilltop
i went a little out of my way to speak to him for we had not met for some time
was that mrs graham you were speaking to just now said he after the first few words of greeting had passed between us
yes humph
i thought so he looked contemplatively at his horses mane as if he had some serious cause of dissatisfaction with it or something else
well
what then oh nothing replied he
only i thought you disliked her he quietly added curling his classic lip with a slightly sarcastic smile
suppose i did maynt a man change his mind on further acquaintance yes of course returned he nicely reducing an entanglement in the ponys redundant hoary mane
then suddenly turning to me and fixing his shy hazel eyes upon me with a steady penetrating gaze he added then you have changed your mind i cant say that i have exactly
no i think i hold the same opinion respecting her as beforebut slightly ameliorated oh he looked round for something else to talk about and glancing up at the moon made some remark upon the beauty of the evening which i did not answer as being irrelevant to the subject
lawrence said i calmly looking him in the face are you in love with mrs graham instead of his being deeply offended at this as i more than half expected he would the first start of surprise at the audacious question was followed by a tittering laugh as if he was highly amused at the idea
i in love with her repeated he
what makes you dream of such a thing from the interest you take in the progress of my acquaintance with the lady and the changes of my opinion concerning her i thought you might be jealous he laughed again
jealous
no
but i thought you were going to marry eliza millward you thought wrong then i am not going to marry either one or the otherthat i know of then i think youd better let them alone are you going to marry jane wilson he coloured and played with the mane again but answeredno i think not then you had better let her alone she wont let me alone he might have said but he only looked silly and said nothing for the space of half a minute and then made another attempt to turn the conversation and this time i let it pass for he had borne enough another word on the subject would have been like the last atom that breaks the camels back
i was too late for tea but my mother had kindly kept the teapot and muffin warm upon the hobs and though she scolded me a little readily admitted my excuses and when i complained of the flavour of the overdrawn tea she poured the remainder into the slopbasin and bade rose put some fresh into the pot and reboil the kettle which offices were performed with great commotion and certain remarkable comments
wellif it had been me now i should have had no tea at allif it had been fergus even he would have to put up with such as there was and been told to be thankful for it was far too good for him but youwe cant do too much for you
its always soif theres anything particularly nice at table mamma winks and nods at me to abstain from it and if i dont attend to that she whispers dont eat so much of that rose gilbert will like it for his supperim nothing at all
in the parlour its come rose put away your things and lets have the room nice and tidy against they come in and keep up a good fire gilbert likes a cheerful fire in the kitchenmake that pie a large one rose i daresay the boysll be hungry and dont put so much pepper in theyll not like it im sureor rose dont put so many spices in the pudding gilbert likes it plainor mind you put plenty of currants in the cake fergus liked plenty if i say well mamma i dont im told i ought not to think of myself
you know rose in all household matters we have only two things to consider first whats proper to be done and secondly whats most agreeable to the gentlemen of the houseanything will do for the ladies and very good doctrine too said my mother
gilbert thinks so im sure very convenient doctrine for us at all events said i but if you would really study my pleasure mother you must consider your own comfort and convenience a little more than you doas for rose i have no doubt shell take care of herself and whenever she does make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness shell take good care to let me know the extent of it
but for you i might sink into the grossest condition of selfindulgence and carelessness about the wants of others from the mere habit of being constantly cared for myself and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied while left in total ignorance of what is done for meif rose did not enlighten me now and then and i should receive all your kindness as a matter of course and never know how much i owe you ah
and you never will know gilbert till youre married
then when youve got some trifling selfconceited girl like eliza millward careless of everything but her own immediate pleasure and advantage or some misguided obstinate woman like mrs graham ignorant of her principal duties and clever only in what concerns her least to knowthen youll find the difference it will do me good mother i was not sent into the world merely to exercise the good capacities and good feelings of otherswas ibut to exert my own towards them and when i marry i shall expect to find more pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable than in being made so by her i would rather give than receive oh
thats all nonsense my dear
its mere boys talk that
youll soon tire of petting and humouring your wife be she ever so charming and then comes the trial well then we must bear one anothers burdens then you must fall each into your proper place
youll do your business and she if shes worthy of you will do hers but its your business to please yourself and hers to please you
im sure your poor dear father was as good a husband as ever lived and after the first six months or so were over i should as soon have expected him to fly as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me
he always said i was a good wife and did my duty and he always did hisbless himhe was steady and punctual seldom found fault without a reason always did justice to my good dinners and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by delayand thats as much as any woman can expect of any man is it so halford
is that the extent of your domestic virtues and does your happy wife exact no more
not many days after this on a mild sunny morningrather soft under foot for the last fall of snow was only just wasted away leaving yet a thin ridge here and there lingering on the fresh green grass beneath the hedges but beside them already the young primroses were peeping from among their moist dark foliage and the lark above was singing of summer and hope and love and every heavenly thingi was out on the hillside enjoying these delights and looking after the wellbeing of my young lambs and their mothers when on glancing round me i beheld three persons ascending from the vale below
they were eliza millward fergus and rose so i crossed the field to meet them and being told they were going to wildfell hall i declared myself willing to go with them and offering my arm to eliza who readily accepted it in lieu of my brothers told the latter he might go back for i would accompany the ladies
i beg your pardon exclaimed he
its the ladies that are accompanying me not i them
you had all had a peep at this wonderful stranger but me and i could endure my wretched ignorance no longercome what would i must be satisfied so i begged rose to go with me to the hall and introduce me to her at once
she swore she would not unless miss eliza would go too so i ran to the vicarage and fetched her and weve come hooked all the way as fond as a pair of loversand now youve taken her from me and you want to deprive me of my walk and my visit besides
go back to your fields and your cattle you lubberly fellow youre not fit to associate with ladies and gentlemen like us that have nothing to do but to run snooking about to our neighbours houses peeping into their private corners and scenting out their secrets and picking holes in their coats when we dont find them ready made to our handsyou dont understand such refined sources of enjoyment cant you both go suggested eliza disregarding the latter half of the speech
yes both to be sure cried rose the more the merrierand im sure we shall want all the cheerfulness we can carry with us to that great dark gloomy room with its narrow latticed windows and its dismal old furnitureunless she shows us into her studio again so we went all in a body and the meagre old maidservant that opened the door ushered us into an apartment such as rose had described to me as the scene of her first introduction to mrs graham a tolerably spacious and lofty room but obscurely lighted by the oldfashioned windows the ceiling panels and chimneypiece of grim black oakthe latter elaborately but not very tastefully carvedwith tables and chairs to match an old bookcase on one side of the fireplace stocked with a motley assemblage of books and an elderly cabinet piano on the other
the lady was seated in a stiff highbacked armchair with a small round table containing a desk and a workbasket on one side of her and her little boy on the other who stood leaning his elbow on her knee and reading to her with wonderful fluency from a small volume that lay in her lap while she rested her hand on his shoulder and abstractedly played with the long wavy curls that fell on his ivory neck
they struck me as forming a pleasing contrast to all the surrounding objects but of course their position was immediately changed on our entrance
i could only observe the picture during the few brief seconds that rachel held the door for our admittance
i do not think mrs graham was particularly delighted to see us there was something indescribably chilly in her quiet calm civility but i did not talk much to her
seating myself near the window a little back from the circle i called arthur to me and he and i and sancho amused ourselves very pleasantly together while the two young ladies baited his mother with small talk and fergus sat opposite with his legs crossed and his hands in his breechespockets leaning back in his chair and staring now up at the ceiling now straight forward at his hostess in a manner that made me strongly inclined to kick him out of the room now whistling sotto voce to himself a snatch of a favourite air now interrupting the conversation or filling up a pause as the case might be with some most impertinent question or remark
at one time it wasit amazes me mrs graham how you could choose such a dilapidated rickety old place as this to live in
if you couldnt afford to occupy the whole house and have it mended up why couldnt you take a neat little cottage perhaps i was too proud mr fergus replied she smiling perhaps i took a particular fancy for this romantic oldfashioned placebut indeed it has many advantages over a cottagein the first place you see the rooms are larger and more airy in the second place the unoccupied apartments which i dont pay for may serve as lumberrooms if i have anything to put in them and they are very useful for my little boy to run about in on rainy days when he cant go out and then there is the garden for him to play in and for me to work in
you see i have effected some little improvement already continued she turning to the window
there is a bed of young vegetables in that corner and here are some snowdrops and primroses already in bloomand there too is a yellow crocus just opening in the sunshine but then how can you bear such a situationyour nearest neighbours two miles distant and nobody looking in or passing by
rose would go stark mad in such a place
she cant put on life unless she sees half a dozen fresh gowns and bonnets a daynot to speak of the faces within but you might sit watching at these windows all day long and never see so much as an old woman carrying her eggs to market i am not sure the loneliness of the place was not one of its chief recommendations
i take no pleasure in watching people pass the windows and i like to be quiet oh
as good as to say you wish we would all of us mind our own business and let you alone no i dislike an extensive acquaintance but if i have a few friends of course i am glad to see them occasionally
no one can be happy in eternal solitude
therefore mr fergus if you choose to enter my house as a friend i will make you welcome if not i must confess i would rather you kept away she then turned and addressed some observation to rose or eliza
and mrs graham said he again five minutes after we were disputing as we came along a question that you can readily decide for us as it mainly regarded yourselfand indeed we often hold discussions about you for some of us have nothing better to do than to talk about our neighbours concerns and we the indigenous plants of the soil have known each other so long and talked each other over so often that we are quite sick of that game so that a stranger coming amongst us makes an invaluable addition to our exhausted sources of amusement
well the question or questions you are requested to solve hold your tongue fergus cried rose in a fever of apprehension and wrath
i wont i tell you
the questions you are requested to solve are thesefirst concerning your birth extraction and previous residence
some will have it that you are a foreigner and some an englishwoman some a native of the north country and some of the south some say well mr fergus ill tell you
im an englishwomanand i dont see why any one should doubt itand i was born in the country neither in the extreme north nor south of our happy isle and in the country i have chiefly passed my life and now i hope you are satisfied for i am not disposed to answer any more questions at present except this no not one more laughed she and instantly quitting her seat she sought refuge at the window by which i was seated and in very desperation to escape my brothers persecutions endeavoured to draw me into conversation
mr
markham said she her rapid utterance and heightened colour too plainly evincing her disquietude have you forgotten the fine seaview we were speaking of some time ago
i think i must trouble you now to tell me the nearest way to it for if this beautiful weather continue i shall perhaps be able to walk there and take my sketch i have exhausted every other subject for painting and i long to see it i was about to comply with her request but rose would not suffer me to proceed
oh dont tell her gilbert cried she she shall go with us
its bay you are thinking about i suppose mrs graham
it is a very long walk too far for you and out of the question for arthur
but we were thinking about making a picnic to see it some fine day and if you will wait till the settled fine weather comes im sure we shall all be delighted to have you amongst us poor mrs graham looked dismayed and attempted to make excuses but rose either compassionating her lonely life or anxious to cultivate her acquaintance was determined to have her and every objection was overruled
she was told it would only be a small party and all friends and that the best view of all was from cliffs full five miles distant
just a nice walk for the gentlemen continued rose but the ladies will drive and walk by turns for we shall have our ponycarriage which will be plenty large enough to contain little arthur and three ladies together with your sketching apparatus and our provisions so the proposal was finally acceded to and after some further discussion respecting the time and manner of the projected excursion we rose and took our leave
but this was only march a cold wet april and two weeks of may passed over before we could venture forth on our expedition with the reasonable hope of obtaining that pleasure we sought in pleasant prospects cheerful society fresh air good cheer and exercise without the alloy of bad roads cold winds or threatening clouds
then on a glorious morning we gathered our forces and set forth
the company consisted of mrs and master graham mary and eliza millward jane and richard wilson and rose fergus and gilbert markham
mr lawrence had been invited to join us but for some reason best known to himself had refused to give us his company
i had solicited the favour myself
when i did so he hesitated and asked who were going
upon my naming miss wilson among the rest he seemed half inclined to go but when i mentioned mrs graham thinking it might be a further inducement it appeared to have a contrary effect and he declined it altogether and to confess the truth the decision was not displeasing to me though i could scarcely tell you why
it was about midday when we reached the place of our destination
mrs graham walked all the way to the cliffs and little arthur walked the greater part of it too for he was now much more hardy and active than when he first entered the neighbourhood and he did not like being in the carriage with strangers while all his four friends mamma and sancho and mr markham and miss millward were on foot journeying far behind or passing through distant fields and lanes
i have a very pleasant recollection of that walk along the hard white sunny road shaded here and there with bright green trees and adorned with flowery banks and blossoming hedges of delicious fragrance or through pleasant fields and lanes all glorious in the sweet flowers and brilliant verdure of delightful may
it was true eliza was not beside me but she was with her friends in the ponycarriage as happy i trusted as i was and even when we pedestrians having forsaken the highway for a short cut across the fields beheld the little carriage far away disappearing amid the green embowering trees i did not hate those trees for snatching the dear little bonnet and shawl from my sight nor did i feel that all those intervening objects lay between my happiness and me for to confess the truth i was too happy in the company of mrs graham to regret the absence of eliza millward
the former it is true was most provokingly unsociable at firstseemingly bent upon talking to no one but mary millward and arthur
she and mary journeyed along together generally with the child between thembut where the road permitted i always walked on the other side of her richard wilson taking the other side of miss millward and fergus roving here and there according to his fancy and after a while she became more friendly and at length i succeeded in securing her attention almost entirely to myselfand then i was happy indeed for whenever she did condescend to converse i liked to listen
where her opinions and sentiments tallied with mine it was her extreme good sense her exquisite taste and feeling that delighted me where they differed it was still her uncompromising boldness in the avowal or defence of that difference her earnestness and keenness that piqued my fancy and even when she angered me by her unkind words or looks and her uncharitable conclusions respecting me it only made me the more dissatisfied with myself for having so unfavourably impressed her and the more desirous to vindicate my character and disposition in her eyes and if possible to win her esteem
at length our walk was ended
the increasing height and boldness of the hills had for some time intercepted the prospect but on gaining the summit of a steep acclivity and looking downward an opening lay before usand the blue sea burst upon our sightdeep violet bluenot deadly calm but covered with glinting breakersdiminutive white specks twinkling on its bosom and scarcely to be distinguished by the keenest vision from the little seamews that sported above their white wings glittering in the sunshine only one or two vessels were visible and those were far away
i looked at my companion to see what she thought of this glorious scene
she said nothing but she stood still and fixed her eyes upon it with a gaze that assured me she was not disappointed
she had very fine eyes bythebyi dont know whether i have told you before but they were full of soul large clear and nearly blacknot brown but very dark grey
a cool reviving breeze blew from the seasoft pure salubrious it waved her drooping ringlets and imparted a livelier colour to her usually too pallid lip and cheek
she felt its exhilarating influence and so did ii felt it tingling through my frame but dared not give way to it while she remained so quiet
there was an aspect of subdued exhilaration in her face that kindled into almost a smile of exalted glad intelligence as her eye met mine
never had she looked so lovely never had my heart so warmly cleaved to her as now
had we been left two minutes longer standing there alone i cannot answer for the consequences
happily for my discretion perhaps for my enjoyment during the remainder of the day we were speedily summoned to the repasta very respectable collation which rose assisted by miss wilson and eliza who having shared her seat in the carriage had arrived with her a little before the rest had set out upon an elevated platform overlooking the sea and sheltered from the hot sun by a shelving rock and overhanging trees
mrs graham seated herself at a distance from me
eliza was my nearest neighbour
she exerted herself to be agreeable in her gentle unobtrusive way and was no doubt as fascinating and charming as ever if i could only have felt it
but soon my heart began to warm towards her once again and we were all very merry and happy togetheras far as i could seethroughout the protracted social meal
when that was over rose summoned fergus to help her to gather up the fragments and the knives dishes c and restore them to the baskets and mrs graham took her campstool and drawing materials and having begged miss millward to take charge of her precious son and strictly enjoined him not to wander from his new guardians side she left us and proceeded along the steep stony hill to a loftier more precipitous eminence at some distance whence a still finer prospect was to be had where she preferred taking her sketch though some of the ladies told her it was a frightful place and advised her not to attempt it
when she was gone i felt as if there was to be no more funthough it is difficult to say what she had contributed to the hilarity of the party
no jests and little laughter had escaped her lips but her smile had animated my mirth a keen observation or a cheerful word from her had insensibly sharpened my wits and thrown an interest over all that was done and said by the rest
even my conversation with eliza had been enlivened by her presence though i knew it not and now that she was gone elizas playful nonsense ceased to amuse menay grew wearisome to my soul and i grew weary of amusing her i felt myself drawn by an irresistible attraction to that distant point where the fair artist sat and plied her solitary taskand not long did i attempt to resist it while my little neighbour was exchanging a few words with miss wilson i rose and cannily slipped away
a few rapid strides and a little active clambering soon brought me to the place where she was seateda narrow ledge of rock at the very verge of the cliff which descended with a steep precipitous slant quite down to the rocky shore
she did not hear me coming the falling of my shadow across her paper gave her an electric start and she looked hastily roundany other lady of my acquaintance would have screamed under such a sudden alarm
oh
i didnt know it was youwhy did you startle me so said she somewhat testily
i hate anybody to come upon me so unexpectedly why what did you take me for said i if i had known you were so nervous i would have been more cautious but well never mind
what did you come for
are they all coming no this little ledge could scarcely contain them all im glad for im tired of talking well then i wont talk
ill only sit and watch your drawing oh but you know i dont like that then ill content myself with admiring this magnificent prospect she made no objection to this and for some time sketched away in silence
but i could not help stealing a glance now and then from the splendid view at our feet to the elegant white hand that held the pencil and the graceful neck and glossy raven curls that drooped over the paper
now thought i if i had but a pencil and a morsel of paper i could make a lovelier sketch than hers admitting i had the power to delineate faithfully what is before me but though this satisfaction was denied me i was very well content to sit beside her there and say nothing
are you there still mr markham said she at length looking round upon mefor i was seated a little behind on a mossy projection of the cliffwhy dont you go and amuse yourself with your friends because i am tired of them like you and i shall have enough of them tomorrowor at any time hence but you i may not have the pleasure of seeing again for i know not how long what was arthur doing when you came away he was with miss millward where you left himall right but hoping mamma would not be long away
you didnt intrust him to me bytheby i grumbled though i had the honour of a much longer acquaintance but miss millward has the art of conciliating and amusing children i carelessly added if she is good for nothing else miss millward has many estimable qualities which such as you cannot be expected to perceive or appreciate
will you tell arthur that i shall come in a few minutes if that be the case i will wait with your permission till those few minutes are past and then i can assist you to descend this difficult path thank youi always manage best on such occasions without assistance but at least i can carry your stool and sketchbook she did not deny me this favour but i was rather offended at her evident desire to be rid of me and was beginning to repent of my pertinacity when she somewhat appeased me by consulting my taste and judgment about some doubtful matter in her drawing
my opinion happily met her approbation and the improvement i suggested was adopted without hesitation
i have often wished in vain said she for anothers judgment to appeal to when i could scarcely trust the direction of my own eye and head they having been so long occupied with the contemplation of a single object as to become almost incapable of forming a proper idea respecting it that replied i is only one of many evils to which a solitary life exposes us true said she and again we relapsed into silence
about two minutes after however she declared her sketch completed and closed the book
on returning to the scene of our repast we found all the company had deserted it with the exception of threemary millward richard wilson and arthur graham
the younger gentleman lay fast asleep with his head pillowed on the ladys lap the other was seated beside her with a pocket edition of some classic author in his hand
he never went anywhere without such a companion wherewith to improve his leisure moments all time seemed lost that was not devoted to study or exacted by his physical nature for the bare support of life
even now he could not abandon himself to the enjoyment of that pure air and balmy sunshinethat splendid prospect and those soothing sounds the music of the waves and of the soft wind in the sheltering trees above himnot even with a lady by his side though not a very charming one i will allowhe must pull out his book and make the most of his time while digesting his temperate meal and reposing his weary limbs unused to so much exercise
perhaps however he spared a moment to exchange a word or a glance with his companion now and thenat any rate she did not appear at all resentful of his conduct for her homely features wore an expression of unusual cheerfulness and serenity and she was studying his pale thoughtful face with great complacency when we arrived
the journey homeward was by no means so agreeable to me as the former part of the day for now mrs graham was in the carriage and eliza millward was the companion of my walk
she had observed my preference for the young widow and evidently felt herself neglected
she did not manifest her chagrin by keen reproaches bitter sarcasms or pouting sullen silenceany or all of these i could easily have endured or lightly laughed away but she showed it by a kind of gentle melancholy a mild reproachful sadness that cut me to the heart
i tried to cheer her up and apparently succeeded in some degree before the walk was over but in the very act my conscience reproved me knowing as i did that sooner or later the tie must be broken and this was only nourishing false hopes and putting off the evil day
when the ponycarriage had approached as near wildfell hall as the road would permitunless indeed it proceeded up the long rough lane which mrs graham would not allowthe young widow and her son alighted relinquishing the drivers seat to rose and i persuaded eliza to take the latters place
having put her comfortably in bid her take care of the evening air and wished her a kind goodnight i felt considerably relieved and hastened to offer my services to mrs graham to carry her apparatus up the fields but she had already hung her campstool on her arm and taken her sketchbook in her hand and insisted upon bidding me adieu then and there with the rest of the company
but this time she declined my proffered aid in so kind and friendly a manner that i almost forgave her
six weeks had passed away
it was a splendid morning about the close of june
most of the hay was cut but the last week had been very unfavourable and now that fine weather was come at last being determined to make the most of it i had gathered all hands together into the hayfield and was working away myself in the midst of them in my shirtsleeves with a light shady straw hat on my head catching up armfuls of moist reeking grass and shaking it out to the four winds of heaven at the head of a goodly file of servants and hirelingsintending so to labour from morning till night with as much zeal and assiduity as i could look for from any of them as well to prosper the work by my own exertion as to animate the workers by my examplewhen lo
my resolutions were overthrown in a moment by the simple fact of my brothers running up to me and putting into my hand a small parcel just arrived from london which i had been for some time expecting
i tore off the cover and disclosed an elegant and portable edition of marmion i guess i know who thats for said fergus who stood looking on while i complacently examined the volume
thats for miss eliza now he pronounced this with a tone and look so prodigiously knowing that i was glad to contradict him
youre wrong my lad said i and taking up my coat i deposited the book in one of its pockets and then put it on ie the coat
now come here you idle dog and make yourself useful for once i continued
pull off your coat and take my place in the field till i come back till you come backand where are you going pray no matterwherethe when is all that concerns youand i shall be back by dinner at least ohoh
and im to labour away till then am iand to keep all these fellows hard at it besides
well well
ill submitfor once in a waycome my lads you must look sharp im come to help you nowand woe be to that man or woman either that pauses for a moment amongst youwhether to stare about him to scratch his head or blow his noseno pretext will servenothing but work work work in the sweat of your face c c leaving him thus haranguing the people more to their amusement than edification i returned to the house and having made some alteration in my toilet hastened away to wildfell hall with the book in my pocket for it was destined for the shelves of mrs graham
what
then had she and you got on so well together as to come to the giving and receiving of presentsnot precisely old buck this was my first experiment in that line and i was very anxious to see the result of it
we had met several times since the bay excursion and i had found she was not averse to my company provided i confined my conversation to the discussion of abstract matters or topics of common interestthe moment i touched upon the sentimental or the complimentary or made the slightest approach to tenderness in word or look i was not only punished by an immediate change in her manner at the time but doomed to find her more cold and distant if not entirely inaccessible when next i sought her company
this circumstance did not greatly disconcert me however because i attributed it not so much to any dislike of my person as to some absolute resolution against a second marriage formed prior to the time of our acquaintance whether from excess of affection for her late husband or because she had had enough of him and the matrimonial state together
at first indeed she had seemed to take a pleasure in mortifying my vanity and crushing my presumptionrelentlessly nipping off bud by bud as they ventured to appear and then i confess i was deeply wounded though at the same time stimulated to seek revengebut latterly finding beyond a doubt that i was not that emptyheaded coxcomb she had first supposed me she had repulsed my modest advances in quite a different spirit
it was a kind of serious almost sorrowful displeasure which i soon learnt carefully to avoid awakening
let me first establish my position as a friend thought ithe patron and playfellow of her son the sober solid plaindealing friend of herself and then when i have made myself fairly necessary to her comfort and enjoyment in life as i believe i can well see what next may be effected so we talked about painting poetry and music theology geology and philosophy once or twice i lent her a book and once she lent me one in return i met her in her walks as often as i could i came to her house as often as i dared
my first pretext for invading the sanctum was to bring arthur a little waddling puppy of which sancho was the father and which delighted the child beyond expression and consequently could not fail to please his mamma
my second was to bring him a book which knowing his mothers particularity i had carefully selected and which i submitted for her approbation before presenting it to him
then i brought her some plants for her garden in my sisters namehaving previously persuaded rose to send them
each of these times i inquired after the picture she was painting from the sketch taken on the cliff and was admitted into the studio and asked my opinion or advice respecting its progress
my last visit had been to return the book she had lent me and then it was that in casually discussing the poetry of sir walter scott she had expressed a wish to see marmion and i had conceived the presumptuous idea of making her a present of it and on my return home instantly sent for the smart little volume i had this morning received
but an apology for invading the hermitage was still necessary so i had furnished myself with a blue morocco collar for arthurs little dog and that being given and received with much more joy and gratitude on the part of the receiver than the worth of the gift or the selfish motive of the giver deserved i ventured to ask mrs graham for one more look at the picture if it was still there
oh yes
come in said she for i had met them in the garden
it is finished and framed all ready for sending away but give me your last opinion and if you can suggest any further improvement it shall beduly considered at least the picture was strikingly beautiful it was the very scene itself transferred as if by magic to the canvas but i expressed my approbation in guarded terms and few words for fear of displeasing her
she however attentively watched my looks and her artists pride was gratified no doubt to read my heartfelt admiration in my eyes
but while i gazed i thought upon the book and wondered how it was to be presented
my heart failed me but i determined not to be such a fool as to come away without having made the attempt
it was useless waiting for an opportunity and useless trying to concoct a speech for the occasion
the more plainly and naturally the thing was done the better i thought so i just looked out of the window to screw up my courage and then pulled out the book turned round and put it into her hand with this short explanation you were wishing to see marmion mrs graham and here it is if you will be so kind as to take it a momentary blush suffused her faceperhaps a blush of sympathetic shame for such an awkward style of presentation she gravely examined the volume on both sides then silently turned over the leaves knitting her brows the while in serious cogitation then closed the book and turning from it to me quietly asked the price of iti felt the hot blood rush to my face
im sorry to offend you mr markham said she but unless i pay for the book i cannot take it and she laid it on the table
why cannot you becauseshe paused and looked at the carpet
why cannot you i repeated with a degree of irascibility that roused her to lift her eyes and look me steadily in the face
because i dont like to put myself under obligations that i can never repayi am obliged to you already for your kindness to my son but his grateful affection and your own good feelings must reward you for that nonsense ejaculated i
she turned her eyes on me again with a look of quiet grave surprise that had the effect of a rebuke whether intended for such or not
then you wont take the book i asked more mildly than i had yet spoken
i will gladly take it if you will let me pay for it i told her the exact price and the cost of the carriage besides in as calm a tone as i could commandfor in fact i was ready to weep with disappointment and vexation
she produced her purse and coolly counted out the money but hesitated to put it into my hand
attentively regarding me in a tone of soothing softness she observedyou think yourself insulted mr markhami wish i could make you understand thatthat i i do understand you perfectly i said
you think that if you were to accept that trifle from me now i should presume upon it hereafter but you are mistakenif you will only oblige me by taking it believe me i shall build no hopes upon it and consider this no precedent for future favoursand it is nonsense to talk about putting yourself under obligations to me when you must know that in such a case the obligation is entirely on my sidethe favour on yours well then ill take you at your word she answered with a most angelic smile returning the odious money to her pursebut remember i will rememberwhat i have saidbut do not you punish my presumption by withdrawing your friendship entirely from meor expect me to atone for it by being more distant than before said i extending my hand to take leave for i was too much excited to remain
well then
let us be as we were replied she frankly placing her hand in mine and while i held it there i had much difficulty to refrain from pressing it to my lipsbut that would be suicidal madness i had been bold enough already and this premature offering had wellnigh given the deathblow to my hopes
it was with an agitated burning heart and brain that i hurried homewards regardless of that scorching noonday sunforgetful of everything but her i had just leftregretting nothing but her impenetrability and my own precipitancy and want of tactfearing nothing but her hateful resolution and my inability to overcome ithoping nothingbut halti will not bore you with my conflicting hopes and fearsmy serious cogitations and resolves
though my affections might now be said to be fairly weaned from eliza millward i did not yet entirely relinquish my visits to the vicarage because i wanted as it were to let her down easy without raising much sorrow or incurring much resentmentor making myself the talk of the parish and besides if i had wholly kept away the vicar who looked upon my visits as paid chiefly if not entirely to himself would have felt himself decidedly affronted by the neglect
but when i called there the day after my interview with mrs graham he happened to be from homea circumstance by no means so agreeable to me now as it had been on former occasions
miss millward was there it is true but she of course would be little better than a nonentity
however i resolved to make my visit a short one and to talk to eliza in a brotherly friendly sort of way such as our long acquaintance might warrant me in assuming and which i thought could neither give offence nor serve to encourage false hopes
it was never my custom to talk about mrs graham either to her or any one else but i had not been seated three minutes before she brought that lady on to the carpet herself in a rather remarkable manner
oh mr markham said she with a shocked expression and voice subdued almost to a whisper what do you think of these shocking reports about mrs grahamcan you encourage us to disbelieve them what reports ah now
you know she slily smiled and shook her head
i know nothing about them
what in the world do you mean eliza oh dont ask mei cant explain it she took up the cambric handkerchief which she had been beautifying with a deep lace border and began to be very busy
what is it miss millward
what does she mean said i appealing to her sister who seemed to be absorbed in the hemming of a large coarse sheet
i dont know replied she
some idle slander somebody has been inventing i suppose
i never heard it till eliza told me the other daybut if all the parish dinned it in my ears i shouldnt believe a word of iti know mrs graham too well quite right miss millwardand so do iwhatever it may be well observed eliza with a gentle sigh its well to have such a comfortable assurance regarding the worth of those we love
i only wish you may not find your confidence misplaced and she raised her face and gave me such a look of sorrowful tenderness as might have melted my heart but within those eyes there lurked a something that i did not like and i wondered how i ever could have admired themher sisters honest face and small grey optics appeared far more agreeable
but i was out of temper with eliza at that moment for her insinuations against mrs graham which were false i was certain whether she knew it or not
i said nothing more on the subject however at the time and but little on any other for finding i could not well recover my equanimity i presently rose and took leave excusing myself under the plea of business at the farm and to the farm i went not troubling my mind one whit about the possible truth of these mysterious reports but only wondering what they were by whom originated and on what foundations raised and how they could the most effectually be silenced or disproved
a few days after this we had another of our quiet little parties to which the usual company of friends and neighbours had been invited and mrs graham among the number
she could not now absent herself under the plea of dark evenings or inclement weather and greatly to my relief she came
without her i should have found the whole affair an intolerable bore but the moment of her arrival brought new life to the house and though i might not neglect the other guests for her or expect to engross much of her attention and conversation to myself alone i anticipated an evening of no common enjoyment
mr lawrence came too
he did not arrive till some time after the rest were assembled
i was curious to see how he would comport himself to mrs graham
a slight bow was all that passed between them on his entrance and having politely greeted the other members of the company he seated himself quite aloof from the young widow between my mother and rose
did you ever see such art whispered eliza who was my nearest neighbour
would you not say they were perfect strangers almost but what then what then why you cant pretend to be ignorant ignorant of what demanded i so sharply that she started and replied oh hush
dont speak so loud well tell me then i answered in a lower tone what is it you mean
i hate enigmas well you know i dont vouch for the truth of itindeed far from itbut havent you heard ive heard nothing except from you you must be wilfully deaf then for anyone will tell you that but i shall only anger you by repeating it i see so i had better hold my tongue she closed her lips and folded her hands before her with an air of injured meekness
if you had wished not to anger me you should have held your tongue from the beginning or else spoken out plainly and honestly all you had to say she turned aside her face pulled out her handkerchief rose and went to the window where she stood for some time evidently dissolved in tears
i was astounded provoked ashamednot so much of my harshness as for her childish weakness
however no one seemed to notice her and shortly after we were summoned to the teatable in those parts it was customary to sit to the table at teatime on all occasions and make a meal of it for we dined early
on taking my seat i had rose on one side of me and an empty chair on the other
may i sit by you said a soft voice at my elbow
if you like was the reply and eliza slipped into the vacant chair then looking up in my face with a halfsad halfplayful smile she whisperedyoure so stern gilbert i handed down her tea with a slightly contemptuous smile and said nothing for i had nothing to say
what have i done to offend you said she more plaintively
i wish i knew come take your tea eliza and dont be foolish responded i handing her the sugar and cream
just then there arose a slight commotion on the other side of me occasioned by miss wilsons coming to negotiate an exchange of seats with rose
will you be so good as to exchange places with me miss markham said she for i dont like to sit by mrs graham
if your mamma thinks proper to invite such persons to her house she cannot object to her daughters keeping company with them this latter clause was added in a sort of soliloquy when rose was gone but i was not polite enough to let it pass
will you be so good as to tell me what you mean miss wilson said i
the question startled her a little but not much
why mr markham replied she coolly having quickly recovered her selfpossession it surprises me rather that mrs markham should invite such a person as mrs graham to her house but perhaps she is not aware that the ladys character is considered scarcely respectable she is not nor am i and therefore you would oblige me by explaining your meaning a little further this is scarcely the time or the place for such explanations but i think you can hardly be so ignorant as you pretendyou must know her as well as i do i think i do perhaps a little better and therefore if you will inform me what you have heard or imagined against her i shall perhaps be able to set you right can you tell me then who was her husband or if she ever had any indignation kept me silent
at such a time and place i could not trust myself to answer
have you never observed said eliza what a striking likeness there is between that child of hers and and whom demanded miss wilson with an air of cold but keen severity
eliza was startled the timidly spoken suggestion had been intended for my ear alone
oh i beg your pardon pleaded she i may be mistakenperhaps i was mistaken but she accompanied the words with a sly glance of derision directed to me from the corner of her disingenuous eye
theres no need to ask my pardon replied her friend but i see no one here that at all resembles that child except his mother and when you hear illnatured reports miss eliza i will thank you that is i think you will do well to refrain from repeating them
i presume the person you allude to is mr lawrence but i think i can assure you that your suspicions in that respect are utterly misplaced and if he has any particular connection with the lady at all which no one has a right to assert at least he has what cannot be said of some others sufficient sense of propriety to withhold him from acknowledging anything more than a bowing acquaintance in the presence of respectable persons he was evidently both surprised and annoyed to find her here go it cried fergus who sat on the other side of eliza and was the only individual who shared that side of the table with us
go it like bricks
mind you dont leave her one stone upon another miss wilson drew herself up with a look of freezing scorn but said nothing
eliza would have replied but i interrupted her by saying as calmly as i could though in a tone which betrayed no doubt some little of what i felt withinwe have had enough of this subject if we can only speak to slander our betters let us hold our tongues i think youd better observed fergus and so does our good parson he has been addressing the company in his richest vein all the while and eyeing you from time to time with looks of stern distaste while you sat there irreverently whispering and muttering together and once he paused in the middle of a story or a sermon i dont know which and fixed his eyes upon you gilbert as much as to say when mr markham has done flirting with those two ladies i will proceed what more was said at the teatable i cannot tell nor how i found patience to sit till the meal was over
i remember however that i swallowed with difficulty the remainder of the tea that was in my cup and ate nothing and that the first thing i did was to stare at arthur graham who sat beside his mother on the opposite side of the table and the second to stare at mr lawrence who sat below and first it struck me that there was a likeness but on further contemplation i concluded it was only in imagination
both it is true had more delicate features and smaller bones than commonly fall to the lot of individuals of the rougher sex and lawrences complexion was pale and clear and arthurs delicately fair but arthurs tiny somewhat snubby nose could never become so long and straight as mr lawrences and the outline of his face though not full enough to be round and too finely converging to the small dimpled chin to be square could never be drawn out to the long oval of the others while the childs hair was evidently of a lighter warmer tint than the elder gentlemans had ever been and his large clear blue eyes though prematurely serious at times were utterly dissimilar to the shy hazel eyes of mr lawrence whence the sensitive soul looked so distrustfully forth as ever ready to retire within from the offences of a too rude too uncongenial world
wretch that i was to harbour that detestable idea for a moment
did i not know mrs graham
had i not seen her conversed with her time after time
was i not certain that she in intellect in purity and elevation of soul was immeasurably superior to any of her detractors that she was in fact the noblest the most adorable of her sex i had ever beheld or even imagined to exist
yes and i would say with mary millward sensible girl as she was that if all the parish ay or all the world should din these horrible lies in my ears i would not believe them for i knew her better than they
meantime my brain was on fire with indignation and my heart seemed ready to burst from its prison with conflicting passions
i regarded my two fair neighbours with a feeling of abhorrence and loathing i scarcely endeavoured to conceal
i was rallied from several quarters for my abstraction and ungallant neglect of the ladies but i cared little for that all i cared about besides that one grand subject of my thoughts was to see the cups travel up to the teatray and not come down again
i thought mr millward never would cease telling us that he was no teadrinker and that it was highly injurious to keep loading the stomach with slops to the exclusion of more wholesome sustenance and so give himself time to finish his fourth cup
at length it was over and i rose and left the table and the guests without a word of apologyi could endure their company no longer
i rushed out to cool my brain in the balmy evening air and to compose my mind or indulge my passionate thoughts in the solitude of the garden
to avoid being seen from the windows i went down a quiet little avenue that skirted one side of the inclosure at the bottom of which was a seat embowered in roses and honeysuckles
here i sat down to think over the virtues and wrongs of the lady of wildfell hall but i had not been so occupied two minutes before voices and laughter and glimpses of moving objects through the trees informed me that the whole company had turned out to take an airing in the garden too
however i nestled up in a corner of the bower and hoped to retain possession of it secure alike from observation and intrusion
but noconfound itthere was some one coming down the avenue
why couldnt they enjoy the flowers and sunshine of the open garden and leave that sunless nook to me and the gnats and midges
but peeping through my fragrant screen of the interwoven branches to discover who the intruders were for a murmur of voices told me it was more than one my vexation instantly subsided and far other feelings agitated my still unquiet soul for there was mrs graham slowly moving down the walk with arthur by her side and no one else
why were they alone
had the poison of detracting tongues already spread through all and had they all turned their backs upon her
i now recollected having seen mrs wilson in the early part of the evening edging her chair close up to my mother and bending forward evidently in the delivery of some important confidential intelligence and from the incessant wagging of her head the frequent distortions of her wrinkled physiognomy and the winking and malicious twinkle of her little ugly eyes i judged it was some spicy piece of scandal that engaged her powers and from the cautious privacy of the communication i supposed some person then present was the luckless object of her calumnies and from all these tokens together with my mothers looks and gestures of mingled horror and incredulity i now concluded that object to have been mrs graham
i did not emerge from my place of concealment till she had nearly reached the bottom of the walk lest my appearance should drive her away and when i did step forward she stood still and seemed inclined to turn back as it was
oh dont let us disturb you mr markham said she
we came here to seek retirement ourselves not to intrude on your seclusion i am no hermit mrs grahamthough i own it looks rather like it to absent myself in this uncourteous fashion from my guests i feared you were unwell said she with a look of real concern
i was rather but its over now
do sit here a little and rest and tell me how you like this arbour said i and lifting arthur by the shoulders i planted him in the middle of the seat by way of securing his mamma who acknowledging it to be a tempting place of refuge threw herself back in one corner while i took possession of the other
but that word refuge disturbed me
had their unkindness then really driven her to seek for peace in solitude
why have they left you alone i asked
it is i who have left them was the smiling rejoinder
i was wearied to death with small talknothing wears me out like that
i cannot imagine how they can go on as they do i could not help smiling at the serious depth of her wonderment
is it that they think it a duty to be continually talking pursued she and so never pause to think but fill up with aimless trifles and vain repetitions when subjects of real interest fail to present themselves or do they really take a pleasure in such discourse very likely they do said i their shallow minds can hold no great ideas and their light heads are carried away by trivialities that would not move a betterfurnished skull and their only alternative to such discourse is to plunge over head and ears into the slough of scandalwhich is their chief delight not all of them surely cried the lady astonished at the bitterness of my remark
no certainly i exonerate my sister from such degraded tastes and my mother too if you included her in your animadversions i meant no animadversions against any one and certainly intended no disrespectful allusions to your mother
i have known some sensible persons great adepts in that style of conversation when circumstances impelled them to it but it is a gift i cannot boast the possession of
i kept up my attention on this occasion as long as i could but when my powers were exhausted i stole away to seek a few minutes repose in this quiet walk
i hate talking where there is no exchange of ideas or sentiments and no good given or received well said i if ever i trouble you with my loquacity tell me so at once and i promise not to be offended for i possess the faculty of enjoying the company of those iof my friends as well in silence as in conversation i dont quite believe you but if it were so you would exactly suit me for a companion i am all you wish then in other respects no i dont mean that
how beautiful those little clusters of foliage look where the sun comes through behind them said she on purpose to change the subject
and they did look beautiful where at intervals the level rays of the sun penetrating the thickness of trees and shrubs on the opposite side of the path before us relieved their dusky verdure by displaying patches of semitransparent leaves of resplendent golden green
i almost wish i were not a painter observed my companion
why so
one would think at such a time you would most exult in your privilege of being able to imitate the various brilliant and delightful touches of nature no for instead of delivering myself up to the full enjoyment of them as others do i am always troubling my head about how i could produce the same effect upon canvas and as that can never be done it is mere vanity and vexation of spirit perhaps you cannot do it to satisfy yourself but you may and do succeed in delighting others with the result of your endeavours well after all i should not complain perhaps few people gain their livelihood with so much pleasure in their toil as i do
here is some one coming she seemed vexed at the interruption
it is only mr lawrence and miss wilson said i coming to enjoy a quiet stroll
they will not disturb us i could not quite decipher the expression of her face but i was satisfied there was no jealousy therein
what business had i to look for it
what sort of a person is miss wilson she asked
she is elegant and accomplished above the generality of her birth and station and some say she is ladylike and agreeable i thought her somewhat frigid and rather supercilious in her manner today very likely she might be so to you
she has possibly taken a prejudice against you for i think she regards you in the light of a rival me
impossible mr markham said she evidently astonished and annoyed
well i know nothing about it returned i rather doggedly for i thought her annoyance was chiefly against myself
the pair had now approached within a few paces of us
our arbour was set snugly back in a corner before which the avenue at its termination turned off into the more airy walk along the bottom of the garden
as they approached this i saw by the aspect of jane wilson that she was directing her companions attention to us and as well by her cold sarcastic smile as by the few isolated words of her discourse that reached me i knew full well that she was impressing him with the idea that we were strongly attached to each other
i noticed that he coloured up to the temples gave us one furtive glance in passing and walked on looking grave but seemingly offering no reply to her remarks
it was true then that he had some designs upon mrs graham and were they honourable he would not be so anxious to conceal them
she was blameless of course but he was detestable beyond all count
while these thoughts flashed through my mind my companion abruptly rose and calling her son said they would now go in quest of the company and departed up the avenue
doubtless she had heard or guessed something of miss wilsons remarks and therefore it was natural enough she should choose to continue the ttette no longer especially as at that moment my cheeks were burning with indignation against my former friend the token of which she might mistake for a blush of stupid embarrassment
for this i owed miss wilson yet another grudge and still the more i thought upon her conduct the more i hated her
it was late in the evening before i joined the company
i found mrs graham already equipped for departure and taking leave of the rest who were now returned to the house
i offered nay begged to accompany her home
mr lawrence was standing by at the time conversing with some one else
he did not look at us but on hearing my earnest request he paused in the middle of a sentence to listen for her reply and went on with a look of quiet satisfaction the moment he found it was to be a denial
a denial it was decided though not unkind
she could not be persuaded to think there was danger for herself or her child in traversing those lonely lanes and fields without attendance
it was daylight still and she should meet no one or if she did the people were quiet and harmless she was well assured
in fact she would not hear of any ones putting himself out of the way to accompany her though fergus vouchsafed to offer his services in case they should be more acceptable than mine and my mother begged she might send one of the farmingmen to escort her
when she was gone the rest was all a blank or worse
lawrence attempted to draw me into conversation but i snubbed him and went to another part of the room
shortly after the party broke up and he himself took leave
when he came to me i was blind to his extended hand and deaf to his goodnight till he repeated it a second time and then to get rid of him i muttered an inarticulate reply accompanied by a sulky nod
what is the matter markham whispered he
i replied by a wrathful and contemptuous stare
are you angry because mrs graham would not let you go home with her he asked with a faint smile that nearly exasperated me beyond control
but swallowing down all fiercer answers i merely demandedwhat business is it of yours why none replied he with provoking quietness onlyand he raised his eyes to my face and spoke with unusual solemnityonly let me tell you markham that if you have any designs in that quarter they will certainly fail and it grieves me to see you cherishing false hopes and wasting your strength in useless efforts for hypocrite i exclaimed and he held his breath and looked very blank turned white about the gills and went away without another word
i had wounded him to the quick and i was glad of it
when all were gone i learnt that the vile slander had indeed been circulated throughout the company in the very presence of the victim
rose however vowed she did not and would not believe it and my mother made the same declaration though not i fear with the same amount of real unwavering incredulity
it seemed to dwell continually on her mind and she kept irritating me from time to time by such expressions asdear dear who would have thought itwell
i always thought there was something odd about heryou see what it is for women to affect to be different to other people and once it was i misdoubted that appearance of mystery from the very firsti thought there would no good come of it but this is a sad sad business to be sure why mother you said you didnt believe these tales said fergus
no more i do my dear but then you know there must be some foundation the foundation is in the wickedness and falsehood of the world said i and in the fact that mr lawrence has been seen to go that way once or twice of an eveningand the village gossips say he goes to pay his addresses to the strange lady and the scandalmongers have greedily seized the rumour to make it the basis of their own infernal structure well but gilbert there must be something in her manner to countenance such reports did you see anything in her manner no certainly but then you know i always said there was something strange about her i believe it was on that very evening that i ventured on another invasion of wildfell hall
from the time of our party which was upwards of a week ago i had been making daily efforts to meet its mistress in her walks and always disappointed she must have managed it so on purpose had nightly kept revolving in my mind some pretext for another call
at length i concluded that the separation could be endured no longer by this time you will see i was pretty far gone and taking from the bookcase an old volume that i thought she might be interested in though from its unsightly and somewhat dilapidated condition i had not yet ventured to offer it for perusal i hastened awaybut not without sundry misgivings as to how she would receive me or how i could summon courage to present myself with so slight an excuse
but perhaps i might see her in the field or the garden and then there would be no great difficulty it was the formal knocking at the door with the prospect of being gravely ushered in by rachel to the presence of a surprised uncordial mistress that so greatly disturbed me
my wish however was not gratified
mrs graham herself was not to be seen but there was arthur playing with his frolicsome little dog in the garden
i looked over the gate and called him to me
he wanted me to come in but i told him i could not without his mothers leave
ill go and ask her said the child
no no arthur you mustnt do that but if shes not engaged just ask her to come here a minute
tell her i want to speak to her he ran to perform my bidding and quickly returned with his mother
how lovely she looked with her dark ringlets streaming in the light summer breeze her fair cheek slightly flushed and her countenance radiant with smiles
dear arthur
what did i not owe to you for this and every other happy meeting
through him i was at once delivered from all formality and terror and constraint
in love affairs there is no mediator like a merry simplehearted childever ready to cement divided hearts to span the unfriendly gulf of custom to melt the ice of cold reserve and overthrow the separating walls of dread formality and pride
well mr markham what is it said the young mother accosting me with a pleasant smile
i want you to look at this book and if you please to take it and peruse it at your leisure
i make no apology for calling you out on such a lovely evening though it be for a matter of no greater importance tell him to come in mamma said arthur
would you like to come in asked the lady
yes i should like to see your improvements in the garden and how your sisters roots have prospered in my charge added she as she opened the gate
and we sauntered through the garden and talked of the flowers the trees and the book and then of other things
the evening was kind and genial and so was my companion
by degrees i waxed more warm and tender than perhaps i had ever been before but still i said nothing tangible and she attempted no repulse until in passing a moss rosetree that i had brought her some weeks since in my sisters name she plucked a beautiful halfopen bud and bade me give it to rose
may i not keep it myself i asked
no but here is another for you instead of taking it quietly i likewise took the hand that offered it and looked into her face
she let me hold it for a moment and i saw a flash of ecstatic brilliance in her eye a glow of glad excitement on her facei thought my hour of victory was comebut instantly a painful recollection seemed to flash upon her a cloud of anguish darkened her brow a marble paleness blanched her cheek and lip there seemed a moment of inward conflict and with a sudden effort she withdrew her hand and retreated a step or two back
now mr markham said she with a kind of desperate calmness i must tell you plainly that i cannot do with this
i like your company because i am alone here and your conversation pleases me more than that of any other person but if you cannot be content to regard me as a frienda plain cold motherly or sisterly friendi must beg you to leave me now and let me alone hereafter in fact we must be strangers for the future i will thenbe your friend or brother or anything you wish if you will only let me continue to see you but tell me why i cannot be anything more there was a perplexed and thoughtful pause
is it in consequence of some rash vow it is something of the kind she answered
some day i may tell you but at present you had better leave me and never gilbert put me to the painful necessity of repeating what i have just now said to you she earnestly added giving me her hand in serious kindness
how sweet how musical my own name sounded in her mouth
i will not i replied
but you pardon this offence on condition that you never repeat it and may i come to see you now and then perhapsoccasionally provided you never abuse the privilege i make no empty promises but you shall see the moment you do our intimacy is at an end thats all and will you always call me gilbert
it sounds more sisterly and it will serve to remind me of our contract she smiled and once more bid me go and at length i judged it prudent to obey and she reentered the house and i went down the hill
but as i went the tramp of horses hoofs fell on my ear and broke the stillness of the dewy evening and looking towards the lane i saw a solitary equestrian coming up
inclining to dusk as it was i knew him at a glance it was mr lawrence on his grey pony
i flew across the field leaped the stone fence and then walked down the lane to meet him
on seeing me he suddenly drew in his little steed and seemed inclined to turn back but on second thought apparently judged it better to continue his course as before
he accosted me with a slight bow and edging close to the wall endeavoured to pass on but i was not so minded
seizing his horse by the bridle i exclaimednow lawrence i will have this mystery explained
tell me where you are going and what you mean to doat once and distinctly will you take your hand off the bridle said he quietlyyoure hurting my ponys mouth you and your pony be what makes you so coarse and brutal markham
im quite ashamed of you you answer my questionsbefore you leave this spot
i will know what you mean by this perfidious duplicity i shall answer no questions till you let go the bridleif you stand till morning now then said i unclosing my hand but still standing before him
ask me some other time when you can speak like a gentleman returned he and he made an effort to pass me again but i quickly recaptured the pony scarce less astonished than its master at such uncivil usage
really mr markham this is too much said the latter
can i not go to see my tenant on matters of business without being assaulted in this manner by this is no time for business sirill tell you now what i think of your conduct youd better defer your opinion to a more convenient season interrupted he in a low toneheres the vicar and in truth the vicar was just behind me plodding homeward from some remote corner of his parish
i immediately released the squire and he went on his way saluting mr millward as he passed
what
quarrelling markham cried the latter addressing himself to meand about that young widow i doubt he added reproachfully shaking his head
but let me tell you young man here he put his face into mine with an important confidential air shes not worth it and he confirmed the assertion by a solemn nod
mr
millward i exclaimed in a tone of wrathful menace that made the reverend gentleman look roundaghastastounded at such unwonted insolence and stare me in the face with a look that plainly said what this to me but i was too indignant to apologise or to speak another word to him i turned away and hastened homewards descending with rapid strides the steep rough lane and leaving him to follow as he pleased
you must suppose about three weeks passed over
mrs graham and i were now established friendsor brother and sister as we rather chose to consider ourselves
she called me gilbert by my express desire and i called her helen for i had seen that name written in her books
i seldom attempted to see her above twice a week and still i made our meetings appear the result of accident as often as i couldfor i found it necessary to be extremely carefuland altogether i behaved with such exceeding propriety that she never had occasion to reprove me once
yet i could not but perceive that she was at times unhappy and dissatisfied with herself or her position and truly i myself was not quite contented with the latter this assumption of brotherly nonchalance was very hard to sustain and i often felt myself a most confounded hypocrite with it all i saw too or rather i felt that in spite of herself i was not indifferent to her as the novel heroes modestly express it and while i thankfully enjoyed my present good fortune i could not fail to wish and hope for something better in future but of course i kept such dreams entirely to myself
where are you going gilbert said rose one evening shortly after tea when i had been busy with the farm all day
to take a walk was the reply
do you always brush your hat so carefully and do your hair so nicely and put on such smart new gloves when you take a walk not always youre going to wildfell hall arent you what makes you think so because you look as if you werebut i wish you wouldnt go so often nonsense child
i dont go once in six weekswhat do you mean well but if i were you i wouldnt have so much to do with mrs graham why rose are you too giving in to the prevailing opinion no returned she hesitatinglybut ive heard so much about her lately both at the wilsons and the vicarageand besides mamma says if she were a proper person she would not be living there by herselfand dont you remember last winter gilbert all that about the false name to the picture and how she explained itsaying she had friends or acquaintances from whom she wished her present residence to be concealed and that she was afraid of their tracing her outand then how suddenly she started up and left the room when that person camewhom she took good care not to let us catch a glimpse of and who arthur with such an air of mystery told us was his mammas friend yes rose i remember it all and i can forgive your uncharitable conclusions for perhaps if i did not know her myself i should put all these things together and believe the same as you do but thank god i do know her and i should be unworthy the name of a man if i could believe anything that was said against her unless i heard it from her own lipsi should as soon believe such things of you rose oh gilbert well do you think i could believe anything of the kindwhatever the wilsons and millwards dared to whisper i should hope not indeed and why notbecause i know youwell and i know her just as well oh no
you know nothing of her former life and last year at this time you did not know that such a person existed no matter
there is such a thing as looking through a persons eyes into the heart and learning more of the height and breadth and depth of anothers soul in one hour than it might take you a lifetime to discover if he or she were not disposed to reveal it or if you had not the sense to understand it then you are going to see her this evening to be sure i am but what would mamma say gilbert mamma neednt know but she must know some time if you go on go ontheres no going on in the matter
mrs graham and i are two friendsand will be and no man breathing shall hinder itor has a right to interfere between us but if you knew how they talk you would be more careful for her sake as well as for your own
jane wilson thinks your visits to the old hall but another proof of her depravity confound jane wilson and eliza millward is quite grieved about you i hope she is but i wouldnt if i were you wouldnt whathow do they know that i go there theres nothing hid from them they spy out everything oh i never thought of thisand so they dare to turn my friendship into food for further scandal against herthat proves the falsehood of their other lies at all events if any proof were wantingmind you contradict them rose whenever you can but they dont speak openly to me about such things it is only by hints and innuendoes and by what i hear others say that i knew what they think well then i wont go today as its getting latish
but oh deuce take their cursed envenomed tongues i muttered in the bitterness of my soul
and just at that moment the vicar entered the room we had been too much absorbed in our conversation to observe his knock
after his customary cheerful and fatherly greeting of rose who was rather a favourite with the old gentleman he turned somewhat sternly to me well sir said he youre quite a stranger
it isletmesee he continued slowly as he deposited his ponderous bulk in the armchair that rose officiously brought towards him it is justsixweeksby my reckoning since you darkenedmydoor he spoke it with emphasis and struck his stick on the floor
is it sir said i
ay
it is so he added an affirmatory nod and continued to gaze upon me with a kind of irate solemnity holding his substantial stick between his knees with his hands clasped upon its head
i have been busy i said for an apology was evidently demanded
busy repeated he derisively
yes you know ive been getting in my hay and now the harvest is beginning humph just then my mother came in and created a diversion in my favour by her loquacious and animated welcome of the reverend guest
she regretted deeply that he had not come a little earlier in time for tea but offered to have some immediately prepared if he would do her the favour to partake of it
not any for me i thank you replied he i shall be at home in a few minutes oh but do stay and take a little
it will be ready in five minutes but he rejected the offer with a majestic wave of the hand
ill tell you what ill take mrs markham said he ill take a glass of your excellent ale with pleasure cried my mother proceeding with alacrity to pull the bell and order the favoured beverage
i thought continued he id just look in upon you as i passed and taste your homebrewed ale
ive been to call on mrs graham have you indeed he nodded gravely and added with awful emphasisi thought it incumbent upon me to do so really ejaculated my mother
why so mr millward asked i
he looked at me with some severity and turning again to my mother repeatedi thought it incumbent upon me and struck his stick on the floor again
my mother sat opposite an awestruck but admiring auditor
mrs
graham said i he continued shaking his head as he spoke these are terrible reports what sir says she affecting to be ignorant of my meaning
it is mydutyasyour pastor said i to tell you both everything that i myself see reprehensible in your conduct and all i have reason to suspect and what others tell me concerning youso i told her you did sir cried i starting from my seat and striking my fist on the table
he merely glanced towards me and continuedaddressing his hostess it was a painful duty mrs markhambut i told her and how did she take it asked my mother
hardened i fearhardened he replied with a despondent shake of the head and at the same time there was a strong display of unchastened misdirected passions
she turned white in the face and drew her breath through her teeth in a savage sort of waybut she offered no extenuation or defence and with a kind of shameless calmnessshocking indeed to witness in one so youngas good as told me that my remonstrance was unavailing and my pastoral advice quite thrown away upon hernay that my very presence was displeasing while i spoke such things
and i withdrew at length too plainly seeing that nothing could be doneand sadly grieved to find her case so hopeless
but i am fully determined mrs markham that my daughtersshallnotconsort with her
do you adopt the same resolution with regard to yoursas for your sonsas for you young man he continued sternly turning to me as for me sir i began but checked by some impediment in my utterance and finding that my whole frame trembled with fury i said no more but took the wiser part of snatching up my hat and bolting from the room slamming the door behind me with a bang that shook the house to its foundations and made my mother scream and gave a momentary relief to my excited feelings
the next minute saw me hurrying with rapid strides in the direction of wildfell hallto what intent or purpose i could scarcely tell but i must be moving somewhere and no other goal would doi must see her too and speak to herthat was certain but what to say or how to act i had no definite idea
such stormy thoughtsso many different resolutions crowded in upon me that my mind was little better than a chaos of conflicting passions
in little more than twenty minutes the journey was accomplished
i paused at the gate to wipe my streaming forehead and recover my breath and some degree of composure
already the rapid walking had somewhat mitigated my excitement and with a firm and steady tread i paced the gardenwalk
in passing the inhabited wing of the building i caught a sight of mrs graham through the open window slowly pacing up and down her lonely room
she seemed agitated and even dismayed at my arrival as if she thought i too was coming to accuse her
i had entered her presence intending to condole with her upon the wickedness of the world and help her to abuse the vicar and his vile informants but now i felt positively ashamed to mention the subject and determined not to refer to it unless she led the way
i am come at an unseasonable hour said i assuming a cheerfulness i did not feel in order to reassure her but i wont stay many minutes she smiled upon me faintly it is true but most kindlyi had almost said thankfully as her apprehensions were removed
how dismal you are helen
why have you no fire i said looking round on the gloomy apartment
it is summer yet she replied
but we always have a fire in the evenings if we can bear it and you especially require one in this cold house and dreary room you should have come a little sooner and i would have had one lighted for you but it is not worth while nowyou wont stay many minutes you say and arthur is gone to bed but i have a fancy for a fire nevertheless
will you order one if i ring why gilbert you dont look cold said she smilingly regarding my face which no doubt seemed warm enough
no replied i but i want to see you comfortable before i go me comfortable repeated she with a bitter laugh as if there were something amusingly absurd in the idea
it suits me better as it is she added in a tone of mournful resignation
but determined to have my own way i pulled the bell
there now helen i said as the approaching steps of rachel were heard in answer to the summons
there was nothing for it but to turn round and desire the maid to light the fire
i owe rachel a grudge to this day for the look she cast upon me ere she departed on her mission the sour suspicious inquisitorial look that plainly demanded what are you here for i wonder her mistress did not fail to notice it and a shade of uneasiness darkened her brow
you must not stay long gilbert said she when the door was closed upon us
im not going to said i somewhat testily though without a grain of anger in my heart against any one but the meddling old woman
but helen ive something to say to you before i go what is it no not nowi dont know yet precisely what it is or how to say it replied i with more truth than wisdom and then fearing lest she should turn me out of the house i began talking about indifferent matters in order to gain time
meanwhile rachel came in to kindle the fire which was soon effected by thrusting a redhot poker between the bars of the grate where the fuel was already disposed for ignition
she honoured me with another of her hard inhospitable looks in departing but little moved thereby i went on talking and setting a chair for mrs graham on one side of the hearth and one for myself on the other i ventured to sit down though half suspecting she would rather see me go
in a little while we both relapsed into silence and continued for several minutes gazing abstractedly into the fireshe intent upon her own sad thoughts and i reflecting how delightful it would be to be seated thus beside her with no other presence to restrain our intercoursenot even that of arthur our mutual friend without whom we had never met beforeif only i could venture to speak my mind and disburden my full heart of the feelings that had so long oppressed it and which it now struggled to retain with an effort that it seemed impossible to continue much longerand revolving the pros and cons for opening my heart to her there and then and imploring a return of affection the permission to regard her thenceforth as my own and the right and the power to defend her from the calumnies of malicious tongues
on the one hand i felt a newborn confidence in my powers of persuasiona strong conviction that my own fervour of spirit would grant me eloquencethat my very determinationthe absolute necessity for succeeding that i felt must win me what i sought while on the other i feared to lose the ground i had already gained with so much toil and skill and destroy all future hope by one rash effort when time and patience might have won success
it was like setting my life upon the cast of a die and yet i was ready to resolve upon the attempt
at any rate i would entreat the explanation she had half promised to give me before i would demand the reason of this hateful barrier this mysterious impediment to my happiness and as i trusted to her own
but while i considered in what manner i could best frame my request my companion wakened from her reverie with a scarcely audible sigh and looking towards the window where the bloodred harvest moon just rising over one of the grim fantastic evergreens was shining in upon us saidgilbert it is getting late i see said i
you want me to go i suppose i think you ought
if my kind neighbours get to know of this visitas no doubt they willthey will not turn it much to my advantage it was with what the vicar would doubtless have called a savage sort of smile that she said this
let them turn it as they will said i
what are their thoughts to you or me so long as we are satisfied with ourselvesand each other
let them go to the deuce with their vile constructions and their lying inventions this outburst brought a flush of colour to her face
you have heard then what they say of me i heard some detestable falsehoods but none but fools would credit them for a moment helen so dont let them trouble you i did not think mr millward a fool and he believes it all but however little you may value the opinions of those about youhowever little you may esteem them as individuals it is not pleasant to be looked upon as a liar and a hypocrite to be thought to practise what you abhor and to encourage the vices you would discountenance to find your good intentions frustrated and your hands crippled by your supposed unworthiness and to bring disgrace on the principles you profess true and if i by my thoughtlessness and selfish disregard to appearances have at all assisted to expose you to these evils let me entreat you not only to pardon me but to enable me to make reparation authorise me to clear your name from every imputation give me the right to identify your honour with my own and to defend your reputation as more precious than my life are you hero enough to unite yourself to one whom you know to be suspected and despised by all around you and identify your interests and your honour with hers
think
it is a serious thing i should be proud to do it helenmost happydelighted beyond expressionand if that be all the obstacle to our union it is demolished and you mustyou shall be mine and starting from my seat in a frenzy of ardour i seized her hand and would have pressed it to my lips but she as suddenly caught it away exclaiming in the bitterness of intense afflictionno no it is not all what is it then
you promised i should know some time and you shall know some timebut not nowmy head aches terribly she said pressing her hand to her forehead and i must have some reposeand surely i have had misery enough today she added almost wildly
but it could not harm you to tell it i persisted it would ease your mind and i should then know how to comfort you she shook her head despondingly
if you knew all you too would blame meperhaps even more than i deservethough i have cruelly wronged you she added in a low murmur as if she mused aloud
you helen
impossible yes not willingly for i did not know the strength and depth of your attachment
i thoughtat least i endeavoured to think your regard for me was as cold and fraternal as you professed it to be or as yours or as mineought to have beenof such a light and selfish superficial nature that there indeed you wronged me illustration i know i did and sometimes i suspected it then but i thought upon the whole there could be no great harm in leaving your fancies and your hopes to dream themselves to nothingor flutter away to some more fitting object while your friendly sympathies remained with me but if i had known the depth of your regard the generous disinterested affection you seem to feel seem helen that you do feel then i would have acted differently how
you could not have given me less encouragement or treated me with greater severity than you did
and if you think you have wronged me by giving me your friendship and occasionally admitting me to the enjoyment of your company and conversation when all hopes of closer intimacy were vainas indeed you always gave me to understandif you think you have wronged me by this you are mistaken for such favours in themselves alone are not only delightful to my heart but purifying exalting ennobling to my soul and i would rather have your friendship than the love of any other woman in the world little comforted by this she clasped her hands upon her knee and glancing upward seemed in silent anguish to implore divine assistance then turning to me she calmly saidtomorrow if you meet me on the moor about midday i will tell you all you seek to know and perhaps you will then see the necessity of discontinuing our intimacyif indeed you do not willingly resign me as one no longer worthy of regard i can safely answer no to that you cannot have such grave confessions to makeyou must be trying my faith helen no no no she earnestly repeatedi wish it were so
thank heaven she added i have no great crime to confess but i have more than you will like to hear or perhaps can readily excuseand more than i can tell you now so let me entreat you to leave me i will but answer me this one question firstdo you love me i will not answer it then i will conclude you do and so goodnight she turned from me to hide the emotion she could not quite control but i took her hand and fervently kissed it
gilbert do leave me she cried in a tone of such thrilling anguish that i felt it would be cruel to disobey
but i gave one look back before i closed the door and saw her leaning forward on the table with her hands pressed against her eyes sobbing convulsively yet i withdrew in silence
i felt that to obtrude my consolations on her then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings
to tell you all the questionings and conjecturesthe fears and hopes and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as i descended the hill would almost fill a volume in itself
but before i was halfway down a sentiment of strong sympathy for her i had left behind me had displaced all other feelings and seemed imperatively to draw me back i began to think why am i hurrying so fast in this direction
can i find comfort or consolationpeace certainty contentment allor anything that i want at home
and can i leave all perturbation sorrow and anxiety behind me there and i turned round to look at the old hall
there was little besides the chimneys visible above my contracted horizon
i walked back to get a better view of it
when it rose in sight i stood still a moment to look and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction
something called me nearernearer stilland why not pray
might i not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile with the full moon in the cloudless heaven shining so calmly above itwith that warm yellow lustre peculiar to an august nightand the mistress of my soul within than in returning to my home where all comparatively was light and life and cheerfulness and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mindand the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veinsand how could i endure to hear it openly declared or cautiously insinuatedwhich was worsei had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that would keep whispering in my ear it may be true till i had shouted aloud it is false
i defy you to make me suppose it i could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlour window
i went up to the garden wall and stood leaning over it with my eyes fixed upon the lattice wondering what she was doing thinking or suffering now and wishing i could speak to her but one word or even catch one glimpse of her before i went
i had not thus looked and wished and wondered long before i vaulted over the barrier unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window just to see if she were more composed than when we partedand if i found her still in deep distress perhaps i might venture attempt a word of comfortto utter one of the many things i should have said before instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity
i looked
her chair was vacant so was the room
but at that moment some one opened the outer door and a voiceher voicesaidcome outi want to see the moon and breathe the evening air they will do me goodif anything will here then were she and rachel coming to take a walk in the garden
i wished myself safe back over the wall
i stood however in the shadow of the tall hollybush which standing between the window and the porch at present screened me from observation but did not prevent me from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlight mrs graham followed by anothernot rachel but a young man slender and rather tall
o heavens how my temples throbbed
intense anxiety darkened my sight but i thoughtyes and the voice confirmed itit was mr lawrence
you should not let it worry you so much helen said he i will be more cautious in future and in time i did not hear the rest of the sentence for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that i could not catch the words
my heart was splitting with hatred but i listened intently for her reply
i heard it plainly enough
but i must leave this place frederick she saidi never can be happy herenor anywhere else indeed she added with a mirthless laughbut i cannot rest here but where could you find a better place replied he so secludedso near me if you think anything of that yes interrupted she it is all i could wish if they could only have left me alone but wherever you go helen there will be the same sources of annoyance
i cannot consent to lose you i must go with you or come to you and there are meddling fools elsewhere as well as here while thus conversing they had sauntered slowly past me down the walk and i heard no more of their discourse but i saw him put his arm round her waist while she lovingly rested her hand on his shoulderand then a tremulous darkness obscured my sight my heart sickened and my head burned like fire i half rushed half staggered from the spot where horror had kept me rooted and leaped or tumbled over the walli hardly know whichbut i know that afterwards like a passionate child i dashed myself on the ground and lay there in a paroxysm of anger and despairhow long i cannot undertake to say but it must have been a considerable time for when having partially relieved myself by a torment of tears and looked up at the moon shining so calmly and carelessly on as little influenced by my misery as i was by its peaceful radiance and earnestly prayed for death or forgetfulness i had risen and journeyed homewardslittle regarding the way but carried instinctively by my feet to the door i found it bolted against me and every one in bed except my mother who hastened to answer my impatient knocking and received me with a shower of questions and rebukes
oh gilbert
how could you do so
where have you been
do come in and take your supper
ive got it all ready though you dont deserve it for keeping me in such a fright after the strange manner you left the house this evening
mr millward was quitebless the boy
how ill he looks
oh gracious
what is the matter nothing nothinggive me a candle but wont you take some supper no i want to go to bed said i taking a candle and lighting it at the one she held in her hand
oh gilbert how you tremble exclaimed my anxious parent
how white you look
do tell me what it is
has anything happened its nothing cried i ready to stamp with vexation because the candle would not light
then suppressing my irritation i added ive been walking too fast thats all
goodnight and marched off to bed regardless of the walking too fast
where have you been that was called after me from below
my mother followed me to the very door of my room with her questionings and advice concerning my health and my conduct but i implored her to let me alone till morning and she withdrew and at length i had the satisfaction to hear her close her own door
there was no sleep for me however that night as i thought and instead of attempting to solicit it i employed myself in rapidly pacing the chamber having first removed my boots lest my mother should hear me
but the boards creaked and she was watchful
i had not walked above a quarter of an hour before she was at the door again
gilbert why are you not in bedyou said you wanted to go confound it
im going said i
but why are you so long about it
you must have something on your mind for heavens sake let me alone and get to bed yourself can it be that mrs graham that distresses you so no no i tell youits nothing i wish to goodness it maynt murmured she with a sigh as she returned to her own apartment while i threw myself on the bed feeling most undutifully disaffected towards her for having deprived me of what seemed the only shadow of a consolation that remained and chained me to that wretched couch of thorns
never did i endure so long so miserable a night as that
and yet it was not wholly sleepless
towards morning my distracting thoughts began to lose all pretensions to coherency and shape themselves into confused and feverish dreams and at length there followed an interval of unconscious slumber
but then the dawn of bitter recollection that succeededthe waking to find life a blank and worse than a blank teeming with torment and miserynot a mere barren wilderness but full of thorns and briersto find myself deceived duped hopeless my affections trampled upon my angel not an angel and my friend a fiend incarnateit was worse than if i had not slept at all
it was a dull gloomy morning the weather had changed like my prospects and the rain was pattering against the window
i rose nevertheless and went out not to look after the farm though that would serve as my excuse but to cool my brain and regain if possible a sufficient degree of composure to meet the family at the morning meal without exciting inconvenient remarks
if i got a wetting that in conjunction with a pretended overexertion before breakfast might excuse my sudden loss of appetite and if a cold ensued the severer the betterit would help to account for the sullen moods and moping melancholy likely to cloud my brow for long enough
my dear gilbert i wish you would try to be a little more amiable said my mother one morning after some display of unjustifiable illhumour on my part
you say there is nothing the matter with you and nothing has happened to grieve you and yet i never saw anyone so altered as you within these last few days
you havent a good word for anybodyfriends and strangers equals and inferiorsits all the same
i do wish youd try to check it check what why your strange temper
you dont know how it spoils you
im sure a finer disposition than yours by nature could not be if youd let it have fair play so youve no excuse that way while she thus remonstrated i took up a book and laying it open on the table before me pretended to be deeply absorbed in its perusal for i was equally unable to justify myself and unwilling to acknowledge my errors and i wished to have nothing to say on the matter
but my excellent parent went on lecturing and then came to coaxing and began to stroke my hair and i was getting to feel quite a good boy but my mischievous brother who was idling about the room revived my corruption by suddenly calling out dont touch him mother
hell bite
hes a very tiger in human form
ive given him up for my partfairly disowned himcast him off root and branch
its as much as my life is worth to come within six yards of him
the other day he nearly fractured my skull for singing a pretty inoffensive lovesong on purpose to amuse him oh gilbert
how could you exclaimed my mother
i told you to hold your noise first you know fergus said i
yes but when i assured you it was no trouble and went on with the next verse thinking you might like it better you clutched me by the shoulder and dashed me away right against the wall there with such force that i thought i had bitten my tongue in two and expected to see the place plastered with my brains and when i put my hand to my head and found my skull not broken i thought it was a miracle and no mistake
but poor fellow added he with a sentimental sighhis hearts brokenthats the truth of itand his heads will you be silent now cried i starting up and eyeing the fellow so fiercely that my mother thinking i meant to inflict some grievous bodily injury laid her hand on my arm and besought me to let him alone and he walked leisurely out with his hands in his pockets singing provokinglyshall i because a womans fair c im not going to defile my fingers with him said i in answer to the maternal intercession
i wouldnt touch him with the tongs i now recollected that i had business with robert wilson concerning the purchase of a certain field adjoining my farma business i had been putting off from day to day for i had no interest in anything now and besides i was misanthropically inclined and moreover had a particular objection to meeting jane wilson or her mother for though i had too good reason now to credit their reports concerning mrs graham i did not like them a bit the better for itor eliza millward eitherand the thought of meeting them was the more repugnant to me that i could not now defy their seeming calumnies and triumph in my own convictions as before
but today i determined to make an effort to return to my duty
though i found no pleasure in it it would be less irksome than idlenessat all events it would be more profitable
if life promised no enjoyment within my vocation at least it offered no allurements out of it and henceforth i would put my shoulder to the wheel and toil away like any poor drudge of a carthorse that was fairly broken in to its labour and plod through life not wholly useless if not agreeable and uncomplaining if not contented with my lot
thus resolving with a kind of sullen resignation if such a term may be allowed i wended my way to ryecote farm scarcely expecting to find its owner within at this time of day but hoping to learn in what part of the premises he was most likely to be found
absent he was but expected home in a few minutes and i was desired to step into the parlour and wait
mrs wilson was busy in the kitchen but the room was not empty and i scarcely checked an involuntary recoil as i entered it for there sat miss wilson chattering with eliza millward
however i determined to be cool and civil
eliza seemed to have made the same resolution on her part
we had not met since the evening of the teaparty but there was no visible emotion either of pleasure or pain no attempt at pathos no display of injured pride she was cool in temper civil in demeanour
there was even an ease and cheerfulness about her air and manner that i made no pretension to but there was a depth of malice in her too expressive eye that plainly told me i was not forgiven for though she no longer hoped to win me to herself she still hated her rival and evidently delighted to wreak her spite on me
on the other hand miss wilson was as affable and courteous as heart could wish and though i was in no very conversable humour myself the two ladies between them managed to keep up a pretty continuous fire of small talk
but eliza took advantage of the first convenient pause to ask if i had lately seen mrs graham in a tone of merely casual inquiry but with a sidelong glanceintended to be playfully mischievousreally brimful and running over with malice
not lately i replied in a careless tone but sternly repelling her odious glances with my eyes for i was vexed to feel the colour mounting to my forehead despite my strenuous efforts to appear unmoved
what
are you beginning to tire already
i thought so noble a creature would have power to attach you for a year at least i would rather not speak of her now ah
then you are convinced at last of your mistakeyou have at length discovered that your divinity is not quite the immaculate i desired you not to speak of her miss eliza oh i beg your pardon
i perceive cupids arrows have been too sharp for you the wounds being more than skindeep are not yet healed and bleed afresh at every mention of the loved ones name say rather interposed miss wilson that mr markham feels that name is unworthy to be mentioned in the presence of rightminded females
i wonder eliza you should think of referring to that unfortunate personyou might know the mention of her would be anything but agreeable to any one here present how could this be borne
i rose and was about to clap my hat upon my head and burst away in wrathful indignation from the house but recollectingjust in time to save my dignitythe folly of such a proceeding and how it would only give my fair tormentors a merry laugh at my expense for the sake of one i acknowledged in my own heart to be unworthy of the slightest sacrificethough the ghost of my former reverence and love so hung about me still that i could not bear to hear her name aspersed by othersi merely walked to the window and having spent a few seconds in vengibly biting my lips and sternly repressing the passionate heavings of my chest i observed to miss wilson that i could see nothing of her brother and added that as my time was precious it would perhaps be better to call again tomorrow at some time when i should be sure to find him at home
oh no said she if you wait a minute he will be sure to come for he has business at l that was our markettown and will require a little refreshment before he goes i submitted accordingly with the best grace i could and happily i had not long to wait
mr wilson soon arrived and indisposed for business as i was at that moment and little as i cared for the field or its owner i forced my attention to the matter in hand with very creditable determination and quickly concluded the bargainperhaps more to the thrifty farmers satisfaction than he cared to acknowledge
then leaving him to the discussion of his substantial refreshment i gladly quitted the house and went to look after my reapers
leaving them busy at work on the side of the valley i ascended the hill intending to visit a cornfield in the more elevated regions and see when it would be ripe for the sickle
but i did not visit it that day for as i approached i beheld at no great distance mrs graham and her son coming down in the opposite direction
they saw me and arthur already was running to meet me but i immediately turned back and walked steadily homeward for i had fully determined never to encounter his mother again and regardless of the shrill voice in my ear calling upon me to wait a moment i pursued the even tenor of my way and he soon relinquished the pursuit as hopeless or was called away by his mother
at all events when i looked back five minutes after not a trace of either was to be seen
this incident agitated and disturbed me most unaccountablyunless you would account for it by saying that cupids arrows not only had been too sharp for me but they were barbed and deeply rooted and i had not yet been able to wrench them from my heart
however that be i was rendered doubly miserable for the remainder of the day
next morning i bethought me i too had business at l so i mounted my horse and set forth on the expedition soon after breakfast
it was a dull drizzly day but that was no matter it was all the more suitable to my frame of mind
it was likely to be a lonely journey for it was no marketday and the road i traversed was little frequented at any other time but that suited me all the better too
as i trotted along however chewing the cud ofbitter fancies i heard another horse at no great distance behind me but i never conjectured who the rider might be or troubled my head about him till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle acclivity or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walkfor rapt in my own reflections i was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought properi lost ground and my fellowtraveller overtook me
he accosted me by name for it was no strangerit was mr lawrence
instinctively the fingers of my whiphand tingled and grasped their charge with convulsive energy but i restrained the impulse and answering his salutation with a nod attempted to push on but he pushed on beside me and began to talk about the weather and the crops
i gave the briefest possible answers to his queries and observations and fell back
he fell back too and asked if my horse was lame
i replied with a look at which he placidly smiled
i was as much astonished as exasperated at this singular pertinacity and imperturbable assurance on his part
i had thought the circumstances of our last meeting would have left such an impression on his mind as to render him cold and distant ever after instead of that he appeared not only to have forgotten all former offences but to be impenetrable to all present incivilities
formerly the slightest hint or mere fancied coldness in tone or glance had sufficed to repulse him now positive rudeness could not drive him away
had he heard of my disappointment and was he come to witness the result and triumph in my despair
i grasped my whip with more determined energy than beforebut still forbore to raise it and rode on in silence waiting for some more tangible cause of offence before i opened the floodgates of my soul and poured out the dammedup fury that was foaming and swelling within
markham said he in his usual quiet tone why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter
you have found your hopes defeated but how am i to blame for it
i warned you beforehand you know but you would not he said no more for impelled by some fiend at my elbow i had seized my whip by the small end andswift and sudden as a flash of lightningbrought the other down upon his head
it was not without a feeling of savage satisfaction that i beheld the instant deadly pallor that overspread his face and the few red drops that trickled down his forehead while he reeled a moment in his saddle and then fell backward to the ground
the pony surprised to be so strangely relieved of its burden started and capered and kicked a little and then made use of its freedom to go and crop the grass of the hedgebank while its master lay as still and silent as a corpse
had i killed himan icy hand seemed to grasp my heart and check its pulsation as i bent over him gazing with breathless intensity upon the ghastly upturned face
but no he moved his eyelids and uttered a slight groan
i breathed againhe was only stunned by the fall
it served him rightit would teach him better manners in future
should i help him to his horse
no
for any other combination of offences i would but his were too unpardonable
he might mount it himself if he likedin a while already he was beginning to stir and look about himand there it was for him quietly browsing on the roadside
so with a muttered execration i left the fellow to his fate and clapping spurs to my own horse galloped away excited by a combination of feelings it would not be easy to analyse and perhaps if i did so the result would not be very creditable to my disposition for i am not sure that a species of exultation in what i had done was not one principal concomitant
shortly however the effervescence began to abate and not many minutes elapsed before i had turned and gone back to look after the fate of my victim
it was no generous impulseno kind relentings that led me to thisnor even the fear of what might be the consequences to myself if i finished my assault upon the squire by leaving him thus neglected and exposed to further injury it was simply the voice of conscience and i took great credit to myself for attending so promptly to its dictatesand judging the merit of the deed by the sacrifice it cost i was not far wrong
mr lawrence and his pony had both altered their positions in some degree
the pony had wandered eight or ten yards further away and he had managed somehow to remove himself from the middle of the road i found him seated in a recumbent position on the banklooking very white and sickly still and holding his cambric handkerchief now more red than white to his head
it must have been a powerful blow but half the creditor the blame of it which you please must be attributed to the whip which was garnished with a massive horses head of plated metal
the grass being sodden with rain afforded the young gentleman a rather inhospitable couch his clothes were considerably bemired and his hat was rolling in the mud on the other side of the road
but his thoughts seemed chiefly bent upon his pony on which he was wistfully gazinghalf in helpless anxiety and half in hopeless abandonment to his fate
i dismounted however and having fastened my own animal to the nearest tree first picked up his hat intending to clap it on his head but either he considered his head unfit for a hat or the hat in its present condition unfit for his head for shrinking away the one he took the other from my hand and scornfully cast it aside
its good enough for you i muttered
my next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him which was soon accomplished for the beast was quiet enough in the main and only winced and flirted a trifle till i got hold of the bridlebut then i must see him in the saddle
here you fellowscoundreldoggive me your hand and ill help you to mount no he turned from me in disgust
i attempted to take him by the arm
he shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch
what you wont
well
you may sit there till doomsday for what i care
but i suppose you dont want to lose all the blood in your bodyill just condescend to bind that up for you let me alone if you please humph with all my heart
you may go to the dl if you chooseand say i sent you but before i abandoned him to his fate i flung his ponys bridle over a stake in the hedge and threw him my handkerchief as his own was now saturated with blood
he took it and cast it back to me in abhorrence and contempt with all the strength he could muster
it wanted but this to fill the measure of his offences
with execrations not loud but deep i left him to live or die as he could well satisfied that i had done my duty in attempting to save himbut forgetting how i had erred in bringing him into such a condition and how insultingly my afterservices had been offeredand sullenly prepared to meet the consequences if he should choose to say i had attempted to murder himwhich i thought not unlikely as it seemed probable he was actuated by such spiteful motives in so perseveringly refusing my assistance
having remounted my horse i just looked back to see how he was getting on before i rode away
he had risen from the ground and grasping his ponys mane was attempting to resume his seat in the saddle but scarcely had he put his foot in the stirrup when a sickness or dizziness seemed to overpower him he leant forward a moment with his head drooped on the animals back and then made one more effort which proving ineffectual he sank back on the bank where i left him reposing his head on the oozy turf and to all appearance as calmly reclining as if he had been taking his rest on his sofa at home
i ought to have helped him in spite of himselfto have bound up the wound he was unable to staunch and insisted upon getting him on his horse and seeing him safe home but besides my bitter indignation against himself there was the question what to say to his servantsand what to my own family
either i should have to acknowledge the deed which would set me down as a madman unless i acknowledged the motive tooand that seemed impossibleor i must get up a lie which seemed equally out of the questionespecially as mr lawrence would probably reveal the whole truth and thereby bring me to tenfold disgraceunless i were villain enough presuming on the absence of witnesses to persist in my own version of the case and make him out a still greater scoundrel than he was
no he had only received a cut above the temple and perhaps a few bruises from the fall or the hoofs of his own pony that could not kill him if he lay there half the day and if he could not help himself surely some one would be coming by it would be impossible that a whole day should pass and no one traverse the road but ourselves
as for what he might choose to say hereafter i would take my chance about it if he told lies i would contradict him if he told the truth i would bear it as best i could
i was not obliged to enter into explanations further than i thought proper
perhaps he might choose to be silent on the subject for fear of raising inquiries as to the cause of the quarrel and drawing the public attention to his connection with mrs graham which whether for her sake or his own he seemed so very desirous to conceal
thus reasoning i trotted away to the town where i duly transacted my business and performed various little commissions for my mother and rose with very laudable exactitude considering the different circumstances of the case
in returning home i was troubled with sundry misgivings about the unfortunate lawrence
the question what if i should find him lying still on the damp earth fairly dying of cold and exhaustionor already stark and chill
thrust itself most unpleasantly upon my mind and the appalling possibility pictured itself with painful vividness to my imagination as i approached the spot where i had left him
but no thank heaven both man and horse were gone and nothing was left to witness against me but two objectsunpleasant enough in themselves to be sure and presenting a very ugly not to say murderous appearancein one place the hat saturated with rain and coated with mud indented and broken above the brim by that villainous whiphandle in another the crimson handkerchief soaking in a deeply tinctured pool of waterfor much rain had fallen in the interim
bad news flies fast it was hardly four oclock when i got home but my mother gravely accosted me withoh gilbertsuch an accident
rose has been shopping in the village and shes heard that mr lawrence has been thrown from his horse and brought home dying this shocked me a trifle as you may suppose but i was comforted to hear that he had frightfully fractured his skull and broken a leg for assured of the falsehood of this i trusted the rest of the story was equally exaggerated and when i heard my mother and sister so feelingly deploring his condition i had considerable difficulty in preventing myself from telling them the real extent of the injuries as far as i knew them
you must go and see him tomorrow said my mother
or today suggested rose theres plenty of time and you can have the pony as your horse is tired
wont you gilbertas soon as youve had something to eat no nohow can we tell that it isnt all a false report
its highly im oh im sure it isnt for the village is all alive about it and i saw two people that had seen others that had seen the man that found him
that sounds farfetched but it isnt so when you think of it well but lawrence is a good rider it is not likely he would fall from his horse at all and if he did it is highly improbable he would break his bones in that way
it must be a gross exaggeration at least no but the horse kicked himor something what his quiet little pony how do you know it was that he seldom rides any other at any rate said my mother you will call tomorrow
whether it be true or false exaggerated or otherwise we shall like to know how he is fergus may go why not you he has more time
i am busy just now oh
but gilbert how can you be so composed about it
you wont mind business for an hour or two in a case of this sort when your friend is at the point of death he is not i tell you for anything you know he may be you cant tell till you have seen him
at all events he must have met with some terrible accident and you ought to see him hell take it very unkind if you dont confound it
i cant
he and i have not been on good terms of late oh my dear boy
surely surely you are not so unforgiving as to carry your little differences to such a length as little differences indeed i muttered
well but only remember the occasion
think how well well dont bother me nowill see about it i replied
and my seeing about it was to send fergus next morning with my mothers compliments to make the requisite inquiries for of course my going was out of the questionor sending a message either
he brought back intelligence that the young squire was laid up with the complicated evils of a broken head and certain contusions occasioned by a fallof which he did not trouble himself to relate the particularsand the subsequent misconduct of his horse and a severe cold the consequence of lying on the wet ground in the rain but there were no broken bones and no immediate prospects of dissolution
it was evident then that for mrs grahams sake it was not his intention to criminate me
that day was rainy like its predecessor but towards evening it began to clear up a little and the next morning was fair and promising
i was out on the hill with the reapers
a light wind swept over the corn and all nature laughed in the sunshine
the lark was rejoicing among the silvery floating clouds
the late rain had so sweetly freshened and cleared the air and washed the sky and left such glittering gems on branch and blade that not even the farmers could have the heart to blame it
but no ray of sunshine could reach my heart no breeze could freshen it nothing could fill the void my faith and hope and joy in helen graham had left or drive away the keen regrets and bitter dregs of lingering love that still oppressed it
while i stood with folded arms abstractedly gazing on the undulating swell of the corn not yet disturbed by the reapers something gently pulled my skirts and a small voice no longer welcome to my ears aroused me with the startling wordsmr
markham mamma wants you wants me arthur yes
why do you look so queer said he half laughing half frightened at the unexpected aspect of my face in suddenly turning towards himand why have you kept so long away
come
wont you come im busy just now i replied scarce knowing what to answer
he looked up in childish bewilderment but before i could speak again the lady herself was at my side
gilbert i must speak with you said she in a tone of suppressed vehemence
i looked at her pale cheek and glittering eye but answered nothing
only for a moment pleaded she
just step aside into this other field she glanced at the reapers some of whom were directing looks of impertinent curiosity towards her
i wont keep you a minute i accompanied her through the gap
arthur darling run and gather those bluebells said she pointing to some that were gleaming at some distance under the hedge along which we walked
the child hesitated as if unwilling to quit my side
go love repeated she more urgently and in a tone which though not unkind demanded prompt obedience and obtained it
well mrs graham said i calmly and coldly for though i saw she was miserable and pitied her i felt glad to have it in my power to torment her
she fixed her eyes upon me with a look that pierced me to the heart and yet it made me smile
i dont ask the reason of this change gilbert said she with bitter calmness i know it too well but though i could see myself suspected and condemned by every one else and bear it with calmness i cannot endure it from youwhy did you not come to hear my explanation on the day i appointed to give it because i happened in the interim to learn all you would have told meand a trifle more i imagine impossible for i would have told you all cried she passionatelybut i wont now for i see you are not worthy of it and her pale lips quivered with agitation
why not may i ask she repelled my mocking smile with a glance of scornful indignation
because you never understood me or you would not soon have listened to my traducersmy confidence would be misplaced in youyou are not the man i thought you
go
i wont care what you think of me she turned away and i went for i thought that would torment her as much as anything and i believe i was right for looking back a minute after i saw her turn half round as if hoping or expecting to find me still beside her and then she stood still and cast one look behind
it was a look less expressive of anger than of bitter anguish and despair but i immediately assumed an aspect of indifference and affected to be gazing carelessly around me and i suppose she went on for after lingering awhile to see if she would come back or call i ventured one more glance and saw her a good way off moving rapidly up the field with little arthur running by her side and apparently talking as he went but she kept her face averted from him as if to hide some uncontrollable emotion
and i returned to my business
but i soon began to regret my precipitancy in leaving her so soon
it was evident she loved meprobably she was tired of mr lawrence and wished to exchange him for me and if i had loved and reverenced her less to begin with the preference might have gratified and amused me but now the contrast between her outward seeming and her inward mind as i supposedbetween my former and my present opinion of her was so harrowingso distressing to my feelings that it swallowed up every lighter consideration
but still i was curious to know what sort of an explanation she would have given meor would give now if i pressed her for ithow much she would confess and how she would endeavour to excuse herself
i longed to know what to despise and what to admire in her how much to pity and how much to hateand what was more i would know
i would see her once more and fairly satisfy myself in what light to regard her before we parted
lost to me she was for ever of course but still i could not bear to think that we had parted for the last time with so much unkindness and misery on both sides
that last look of hers had sunk into my heart i could not forget it
but what a fool i was
had she not deceived me injured meblighted my happiness for life
well ill see her however was my concluding resolve but not today today and tonight she may think upon her sins and be as miserable as she will tomorrow i will see her once again and know something more about her
the interview may be serviceable to her or it may not
at any rate it will give a breath of excitement to the life she has doomed to stagnation and may calm with certainty some agitating thoughts i did go on the morrow but not till towards evening after the business of the day was concluded that is between six and seven and the westering sun was gleaming redly on the old hall and flaming in the latticed windows as i reached it imparting to the place a cheerfulness not its own
i need not dilate upon the feelings with which i approached the shrine of my former divinitythat spot teeming with a thousand delightful recollections and glorious dreamsall darkened now by one disastrous truth
rachel admitted me into the parlour and went to call her mistress for she was not there but there was her desk left open on the little round table beside the highbacked chair with a book laid upon it
her limited but choice collection of books was almost as familiar to me as my own but this volume i had not seen before
i took it up
it was sir humphry davys last days of a philosopher and on the first leaf was written frederick lawrence i closed the book but kept it in my hand and stood facing the door with my back to the fireplace calmly waiting her arrival for i did not doubt she would come
and soon i heard her step in the hall
my heart was beginning to throb but i checked it with an internal rebuke and maintained my composureoutwardly at least
she entered calm pale collected
to what am i indebted for this favour mr markham said she with such severe but quiet dignity as almost disconcerted me but i answered with a smile and impudently enough well i am come to hear your explanation i told you i would not give it said she
i said you were unworthy of my confidence oh very well replied i moving to the door
stay a moment said she
this is the last time i shall see you dont go just yet i remained awaiting her further commands
tell me resumed she on what grounds you believe these things against me who told you and what did they say i paused a moment
she met my eye as unflinchingly as if her bosom had been steeled with conscious innocence
she was resolved to know the worst and determined to dare it too
i can crush that bold spirit thought i
but while i secretly exulted in my power i felt disposed to dally with my victim like a cat
showing her the book that i still held in my hand and pointing to the name on the flyleaf but fixing my eye upon her face i askeddo you know that gentleman of course i do replied she and a sudden flush suffused her featureswhether of shame or anger i could not tell it rather resembled the latter
what next sir how long is it since you saw him who gave you the right to catechize me on this or any other subject oh no oneits quite at your option whether to answer or not
and now let me askhave you heard what has lately befallen this friend of yoursbecause if you have not i will not be insulted mr markham cried she almost infuriated at my manner
so you had better leave the house at once if you came only for that i did not come to insult you i came to hear your explanation and i tell you i wont give it retorted she pacing the room in a state of strong excitement with her hands clasped tightly together breathing short and flashing fires of indignation from her eyes
i will not condescend to explain myself to one that can make a jest of such horrible suspicions and be so easily led to entertain them i do not make a jest of them mrs graham returned i dropping at once my tone of taunting sarcasm
i heartily wish i could find them a jesting matter
and as to being easily led to suspect god only knows what a blind incredulous fool i have hitherto been perseveringly shutting my eyes and stopping my ears against everything that threatened to shake my confidence in you till proof itself confounded my infatuation what proof sir well ill tell you
you remember that evening when i was here last i do even then you dropped some hints that might have opened the eyes of a wiser man but they had no such effect upon me i went on trusting and believing hoping against hope and adoring where i could not comprehend
it so happened however that after i left you i turned backdrawn by pure depth of sympathy and ardour of affectionnot daring to intrude my presence openly upon you but unable to resist the temptation of catching one glimpse through the window just to see how you were for i had left you apparently in great affliction and i partly blamed my own want of forbearance and discretion as the cause of it
if i did wrong love alone was my incentive and the punishment was severe enough for it was just as i had reached that tree that you came out into the garden with your friend
not choosing to show myself under the circumstances i stood still in the shadow till you had both passed by and how much of our conversation did you hear i heard quite enough helen
and it was well for me that i did hear it for nothing less could have cured my infatuation
i always said and thought that i would never believe a word against you unless i heard it from your own lips
all the hints and affirmations of others i treated as malignant baseless slanders your own selfaccusations i believed to be overstrained and all that seemed unaccountable in your position i trusted that you could account for if you chose mrs graham had discontinued her walk
she leant against one end of the chimneypiece opposite that near which i was standing with her chin resting on her closed hand her eyesno longer burning with anger but gleaming with restless excitementsometimes glancing at me while i spoke then coursing the opposite wall or fixed upon the carpet
you should have come to me after all said she and heard what i had to say in my own justification
it was ungenerous and wrong to withdraw yourself so secretly and suddenly immediately after such ardent protestations of attachment without ever assigning a reason for the change
you should have told me allno matter how bitterly
it would have been better than this silence to what end should i have done so
you could not have enlightened me further on the subject which alone concerned me nor could you have made me discredit the evidence of my senses
i desired our intimacy to be discontinued at once as you yourself had acknowledged would probably be the case if i knew all but i did not wish to upbraid youthough as you also acknowledged you had deeply wronged me
yes you have done me an injury you can never repairor any other eitheryou have blighted the freshness and promise of youth and made my life a wilderness
i might live a hundred years but i could never recover from the effects of this withering blowand never forget it
hereafteryou smile mrs graham said i suddenly stopping short checked in my passionate declamation by unutterable feelings to behold her actually smiling at the picture of the ruin she had wrought
did i replied she looking seriously up i was not aware of it
if i did it was not for pleasure at the thoughts of the harm i had done you
heaven knows i have had torment enough at the bare possibility of that it was for joy to find that you had some depth of soul and feeling after all and to hope that i had not been utterly mistaken in your worth
but smiles and tears are so alike with me they are neither of them confined to any particular feelings i often cry when i am happy and smile when i am sad she looked at me again and seemed to expect a reply but i continued silent
would you be very glad resumed she to find that you were mistaken in your conclusions how can you ask it helen i dont say i can clear myself altogether said she speaking low and fast while her heart beat visibly and her bosom heaved with excitementbut would you be glad to discover i was better than you think me anything that could in the least degree tend to restore my former opinion of you to excuse the regard i still feel for you and alleviate the pangs of unutterable regret that accompany it would be only too gladly too eagerly received her cheeks burned and her whole frame trembled now with excess of agitation
she did not speak but flew to her desk and snatching thence what seemed a thick album or manuscript volume hastily tore away a few leaves from the end and thrust the rest into my hand saying you neednt read it all but take it home with you and hurried from the room
but when i had left the house and was proceeding down the walk she opened the window and called me back
it was only to saybring it back when you have read it and dont breathe a word of what it tells you to any living being
i trust to your honour before i could answer she had closed the casement and turned away
i saw her cast herself back in the old oak chair and cover her face with her hands
her feelings had been wrought to a pitch that rendered it necessary to seek relief in tears
panting with eagerness and struggling to suppress my hopes i hurried home and rushed upstairs to my room having first provided myself with a candle though it was scarcely twilight yetthen shut and bolted the door determined to tolerate no interruption and sitting down before the table opened out my prize and delivered myself up to its perusalfirst hastily turning over the leaves and snatching a sentence here and there and then setting myself steadily to read it through
i have it now before me and though you could not of course peruse it with half the interest that i did i know you would not be satisfied with an abbreviation of its contents and you shall have the whole save perhaps a few passages here and there of merely temporary interest to the writer or such as would serve to encumber the story rather than elucidate it
it begins somewhat abruptly thusbut we will reserve its commencement for another chapter
june st we have just returned to staningleythat is we returned some days ago and i am not yet settled and feel as if i never should be
we left town sooner than was intended in consequence of my uncles indispositioni wonder what would have been the result if we had stayed the full time
i am quite ashamed of my newsprung distaste for country life
all my former occupations seem so tedious and dull my former amusements so insipid and unprofitable
i cannot enjoy my music because there is no one to hear it
i cannot enjoy my walks because there is no one to meet
i cannot enjoy my books because they have not power to arrest my attention my head is so haunted with the recollections of the last few weeks that i cannot attend to them
my drawing suits me best for i can draw and think at the same time and if my productions cannot now be seen by any one but myself and those who do not care about them they possibly may be hereafter
but then there is one face i am always trying to paint or to sketch and always without success and that vexes me
as for the owner of that face i cannot get him out of my mindand indeed i never try
i wonder whether he ever thinks of me and i wonder whether i shall ever see him again
and then might follow a train of other wondermentsquestions for time and fate to answerconcluding withsupposing all the rest be answered in the affirmative i wonder whether i shall ever repent it
as my aunt would tell me i should if she knew what i was thinking about
how distinctly i remember our conversation that evening before our departure for town when we were sitting together over the fire my uncle having gone to bed with a slight attack of the gout
helen said she after a thoughtful silence do you ever think about marriage yes aunt often and do you ever contemplate the possibility of being married yourself or engaged before the season is over sometimes but i dont think it at all likely that i ever shall why so because i imagine there must be only a very very few men in the world that i should like to marry and of those few it is ten to one i may never be acquainted with one or if i should it is twenty to one he may not happen to be single or to take a fancy to me that is no argument at all
it may be very trueand i hope is true that there are very few men whom you would choose to marry of yourself
it is not indeed to be supposed that you would wish to marry any one till you were asked a girls affections should never be won unsought
but when they are soughtwhen the citadel of the heart is fairly besiegedit is apt to surrender sooner than the owner is aware of and often against her better judgment and in opposition to all her preconceived ideas of what she could have loved unless she be extremely careful and discreet
now i want to warn you helen of these things and to exhort you to be watchful and circumspect from the very commencement of your career and not to suffer your heart to be stolen from you by the first foolish or unprincipled person that covets the possession of ityou know my dear you are only just eighteen there is plenty of time before you and neither your uncle nor i are in any hurry to get you off our hands and i may venture to say there will be no lack of suitors for you can boast a good family a pretty considerable fortune and expectations and i may as well tell you likewisefor if i dont others willthat you have a fair share of beauty besidesand i hope you may never have cause to regret it i hope not aunt but why should you fear it because my dear beauty is that quality which next to money is generally the most attractive to the worst kinds of men and therefore it is likely to entail a great deal of trouble on the possessor have you been troubled in that way aunt no helen said she with reproachful gravity but i know many that have and some through carelessness have been the wretched victims of deceit and some through weakness have fallen into snares and temptations terrible to relate well i shall be neither careless nor weak remember peter helen
dont boast but watch
keep a guard over your eyes and ears as the inlets of your heart and over your lips as the outlet lest they betray you in a moment of unwariness
receive coldly and dispassionately every attention till you have ascertained and duly considered the worth of the aspirant and let your affections be consequent upon approbation alone
first study then approve then love
let your eyes be blind to all external attractions your ears deaf to all the fascinations of flattery and light discoursethese are nothingand worse than nothingsnares and wiles of the tempter to lure the thoughtless to their own destruction
principle is the first thing after all and next to that good sense respectability and moderate wealth
if you should marry the handsomest and most accomplished and superficially agreeable man in the world you little know the misery that would overwhelm you if after all you should find him to be a worthless reprobate or even an impracticable fool but what are all the poor fools and reprobates to do aunt
if everybody followed your advice the world would soon come to an end never fear my dear
the male fools and reprobates will never want for partners while there are so many of the other sex to match them but do you follow my advice
and this is no subject for jesting heleni am sorry to see you treat the matter in that light way
believe me matrimony is a serious thing and she spoke it so seriously that one might have fancied she had known it to her cost but i asked no more impertinent questions and merely answered i know it is and i know there is truth and sense in what you say but you need not fear me for i not only should think it wrong to marry a man that was deficient in sense or in principle but i should never be tempted to do it for i could not like him if he were ever so handsome and ever so charming in other respects i should hate himdespise himpity himanything but love him
my affections not only ought to be founded on approbation but they will and must be so for without approving i cannot love
it is needless to say i ought to be able to respect and honour the man i marry as well as love him for i cannot love him without
so set your mind at rest i hope it may be so answered she
i know it is so persisted i
you have not been tried yet helenwe can but hope said she in her cold cautious way
i was vexed at her incredulity but i am not sure her doubts were entirely without sagacity i fear i have found it much easier to remember her advice than to profit by itindeed i have sometimes been led to question the soundness of her doctrines on those subjects
her counsels may be good as far as they goin the main points at leastbut there are some things she has overlooked in her calculations
i wonder if she was ever in love
i commenced my careeror my first campaign as my uncle calls itkindling with bright hopes and fancieschiefly raised by this conversationand full of confidence in my own discretion
at first i was delighted with the novelty and excitement of our london life but soon i began to weary of its mingled turbulence and constraint and sigh for the freshness and freedom of home
my new acquaintances both male and female disappointed my expectations and vexed and depressed me by turns for i soon grew tired of studying their peculiarities and laughing at their foiblesparticularly as i was obliged to keep my criticisms to myself for my aunt would not hear themand theythe ladies especiallyappeared so provokingly mindless and heartless and artificial
the gentlemen seemed better but perhaps it was because i knew them lessperhaps because they flattered me but i did not fall in love with any of them and if their attentions pleased me one moment they provoked me the next because they put me out of humour with myself by revealing my vanity and making me fear i was becoming like some of the ladies i so heartily despised
there was one elderly gentleman that annoyed me very much a rich old friend of my uncles who i believe thought i could not do better than marry him but besides being old he was ugly and disagreeableand wicked i am sure though my aunt scolded me for saying so but she allowed he was no saint
and there was another less hateful but still more tiresome because she favoured him and was always thrusting him upon me and sounding his praises in my earsmr
boarham by name boreem as i prefer spelling it for a terrible bore he was i shudder still at the remembrance of his voicedrone drone drone in my earwhile he sat beside me prosing away by the halfhour together and beguiling himself with the notion that he was improving my mind by useful information or impressing his dogmas upon me and reforming my errors of judgment or perhaps that he was talking down to my level and amusing me with entertaining discourse
yet he was a decent man enough in the main i daresay and if he had kept his distance i never would have hated him
as it was it was almost impossible to help it for he not only bothered me with the infliction of his own presence but he kept me from the enjoyment of more agreeable society
one night however at a ball he had been more than usually tormenting and my patience was quite exhausted
it appeared as if the whole evening was fated to be insupportable i had just had one dance with an emptyheaded coxcomb and then mr boarham had come upon me and seemed determined to cling to me for the rest of the night
he never danced himself and there he sat poking his head in my face and impressing all beholders with the idea that he was a confirmed acknowledged lover my aunt looking complacently on all the time and wishing him godspeed
in vain i attempted to drive him away by giving a loose to my exasperated feelings even to positive rudeness nothing could convince him that his presence was disagreeable
sullen silence was taken for rapt attention and gave him greater room to talk sharp answers were received as smart sallies of girlish vivacity that only required an indulgent rebuke and flat contradictions were but as oil to the flames calling forth new strains of argument to support his dogmas and bringing down upon me endless floods of reasoning to overwhelm me with conviction
but there was one present who seemed to have a better appreciation of my frame of mind
a gentleman stood by who had been watching our conference for some time evidently much amused at my companions remorseless pertinacity and my manifest annoyance and laughing to himself at the asperity and uncompromising spirit of my replies
at length however he withdrew and went to the lady of the house apparently for the purpose of asking an introduction to me for shortly after they both came up and she introduced him as mr huntingdon the son of a late friend of my uncles
he asked me to dance
i gladly consented of course and he was my companion during the remainder of my stay which was not long for my aunt as usual insisted upon an early departure
i was sorry to go for i had found my new acquaintance a very lively and entertaining companion
there was a certain graceful ease and freedom about all he said and did that gave a sense of repose and expansion to the mind after so much constraint and formality as i had been doomed to suffer
there might be it is true a little too much careless boldness in his manner and address but i was in so good a humour and so grateful for my late deliverance from mr boarham that it did not anger me
well helen how do you like mr boarham now said my aunt as we took our seats in the carriage and drove away
worse than ever i replied
she looked displeased but said no more on that subject
who was the gentleman you danced with last resumed she after a pausethat was so officious in helping you on with your shawl he was not officious at all aunt he never attempted to help me till he saw mr boarham coming to do so and then he stepped laughingly forward and said come ill preserve you from that infliction who was it i ask said she with frigid gravity
it was mr huntingdon the son of uncles old friend i have heard your uncle speak of young mr huntingdon
ive heard him say hes a fine lad that young huntingdon but a bit wildish i fancy so id have you beware what does a bit wildish mean i inquired
it means destitute of principle and prone to every vice that is common to youth but ive heard uncle say he was a sad wild fellow himself when he was young she sternly shook her head
he was jesting then i suppose said i and here he was speaking at randomat least i cannot believe there is any harm in those laughing blue eyes false reasoning helen said she with a sigh
well we ought to be charitable you know auntbesides i dont think it is false i am an excellent physiognomist and i always judge of peoples characters by their looksnot by whether they are handsome or ugly but by the general cast of the countenance
for instance i should know by your countenance that you were not of a cheerful sanguine disposition and i should know by mr wilmots that he was a worthless old reprobate and by mr boarhams that he was not an agreeable companion and by mr huntingdons that he was neither a fool nor a knave though possibly neither a sage nor a saintbut that is no matter to me as i am not likely to meet him againunless as an occasional partner in the ballroom it was not so however for i met him again next morning
he came to call upon my uncle apologising for not having done so before by saying he was only lately returned from the continent and had not heard till the previous night of my uncles arrival in town and after that i often met him sometimes in public sometimes at home for he was very assiduous in paying his respects to his old friend who did not however consider himself greatly obliged by the attention
i wonder what the deuce the lad means by coming so often he would saycan you tell helenhey
he wants none o my company nor i histhats certain i wish youd tell him so then said my aunt
why what for
if i dont want him somebody does mayhap winking at me
besides hes a pretty tidy fortune peggy you knownot such a catch as wilmot but then helen wont hear of that match for somehow these old chaps dont go down with the girlswith all their money and their experience to boot
ill bet anything shed rather have this young fellow without a penny than wilmot with his house full of gold
wouldnt you nell yes uncle but thats not saying much for mr huntingdon for id rather be an old maid and a pauper than mrs wilmot and mrs huntingdon
what would you rather be than mrs huntingdoneh ill tell you when ive considered the matter ah
it needs consideration then
but come nowwould you rather be an old maidlet alone the pauper i cant tell till im asked and i left the room immediately to escape further examination
but five minutes after in looking from my window i beheld mr boarham coming up to the door
i waited nearly halfanhour in uncomfortable suspense expecting every minute to be called and vainly longing to hear him go
then footsteps were heard on the stairs and my aunt entered the room with a solemn countenance and closed the door behind her
here is mr boarham helen said she
he wishes to see you oh auntcant you tell him im indisposedim sure i amto see him nonsense my dear
this is no trifling matter
he is come on a very important errandto ask your hand in marriage of your uncle and me i hope my uncle and you told him it was not in your power to give it
what right had he to ask any one before me helen what did my uncle say he said he would not interfere in the matter if you liked to accept mr boarhams obliging offer you did he say obliging offer no he said if you liked to take him you might and if not you might please yourself he said right and what did you say it is no matter what i said
what will you saythat is the question
he is now waiting to ask you himself but consider well before you go and if you intend to refuse him give me your reasons i shall refuse him of course but you must tell me how for i want to be civil and yet decidedand when ive got rid of him ill give you my reasons afterwards but stay helen sit down a little and compose yourself
mr boarham is in no particular hurry for he has little doubt of your acceptance and i want to speak with you
tell me my dear what are your objections to him
do you deny that he is an upright honourable man no do you deny that he is sensible sober respectable no he may be all this but but helen
how many such men do you expect to meet with in the world
upright honourable sensible sober respectable
is this such an everyday character that you should reject the possessor of such noble qualities without a moments hesitation
yes noble i may call them for think of the full meaning of each and how many inestimable virtues they include and i might add many more to the list and consider that all this is laid at your feet
it is in your power to secure this inestimable blessing for lifea worthy and excellent husband who loves you tenderly but not too fondly so as to blind him to your faults and will be your guide throughout lifes pilgrimage and your partner in eternal bliss
think how but i hate him aunt said i interrupting this unusual flow of eloquence
hate him helen
is this a christian spirityou hate him and he so good a man i dont hate him as a man but as a husband
as a man i love him so much that i wish him a better wife than ione as good as himself or betterif you think that possibleprovided she could like him but i never could and therefore but why not
what objection do you find firstly he is at least forty years oldconsiderably more i should thinkand i am but eighteen secondly he is narrowminded and bigoted in the extreme thirdly his tastes and feelings are wholly dissimilar to mine fourthly his looks voice and manner are particularly displeasing to me and finally i have an aversion to his whole person that i never can surmount then you ought to surmount it
and please to compare him for a moment with mr huntingdon and good looks apart which contribute nothing to the merit of the man or to the happiness of married life and which you have so often professed to hold in light esteem tell me which is the better man i have no doubt mr huntingdon is a much better man than you think him but we are not talking about him now but about mr boarham and as i would rather grow live and die in single blessednessthan be his wife it is but right that i should tell him so at once and put him out of suspenseso let me go but dont give him a flat denial he has no idea of such a thing and it would offend him greatly say you have no thoughts of matrimony at present but i have thoughts of it or that you desire a further acquaintance but i dont desire a further acquaintancequite the contrary and without waiting for further admonitions i left the room and went to seek mr boarham
he was walking up and down the drawingroom humming snatches of tunes and nibbling the end of his cane
my dear young lady said he bowing and smirking with great complacency i have your kind guardians permission i know sir said i wishing to shorten the scene as much as possible and i am greatly obliged for your preference but must beg to decline the honour you wish to confer for i think we were not made for each other as you yourself would shortly discover if the experiment were tried my aunt was right
it was quite evident he had had little doubt of my acceptance and no idea of a positive denial
he was amazed astounded at such an answer but too incredulous to be much offended and after a little humming and hawing he returned to the attack
i know my dear that there exists a considerable disparity between us in years in temperament and perhaps some other things but let me assure you i shall not be severe to mark the faults and foibles of a young and ardent nature such as yours and while i acknowledge them to myself and even rebuke them with all a fathers care believe me no youthful lover could be more tenderly indulgent towards the object of his affections than i to you and on the other hand let me hope that my more experienced years and graver habits of reflection will be no disparagement in your eyes as i shall endeavour to make them all conducive to your happiness
come now
what do you say
let us have no young ladys affectations and caprices but speak out at once i will but only to repeat what i said before that i am certain we were not made for each other you really think so i do but you dont know meyou wish for a further acquaintancea longer time to no i dont
i know you as well as i ever shall and better than you know me or you would never dream of uniting yourself to one so incongruousso utterly unsuitable to you in every way but my dear young lady i dont look for perfection i can excuse thank you mr boarham but i wont trespass upon your goodness
you may save your indulgence and consideration for some more worthy object that wont tax them so heavily but let me beg you to consult your aunt that excellent lady i am sure will i have consulted her and i know her wishes coincide with yours but in such important matters i take the liberty of judging for myself and no persuasion can alter my inclinations or induce me to believe that such a step would be conducive to my happiness or yoursand i wonder that a man of your experience and discretion should think of choosing such a wife ah well said he i have sometimes wondered at that myself
i have sometimes said to myself now boarham what is this youre after
take care manlook before you leap
this is a sweet bewitching creature but remember the brightest attractions to the lover too often prove the husbands greatest torments i assure you my choice has not been made without much reasoning and reflection
the seeming imprudence of the match has cost me many an anxious thought by day and many a sleepless hour by night but at length i satisfied myself that it was not in very deed imprudent
i saw my sweet girl was not without her faults but of these her youth i trusted was not one but rather an earnest of virtues yet unblowna strong ground of presumption that her little defects of temper and errors of judgment opinion or manner were not irremediable but might easily be removed or mitigated by the patient efforts of a watchful and judicious adviser and where i failed to enlighten and control i thought i might safely undertake to pardon for the sake of her many excellences
therefore my dearest girl since i am satisfied why should you objecton my account at least but to tell you the truth mr boarham it is on my own account i principally object so let usdrop the subject i would have said for it is worse than useless to pursue it any further but he pertinaciously interrupted me withbut why so
i would love you cherish you protect you c c i shall not trouble myself to put down all that passed between us
suffice it to say that i found him very troublesome and very hard to convince that i really meant what i said and really was so obstinate and blind to my own interests that there was no shadow of a chance that either he or my aunt would ever be able to overcome my objections
indeed i am not sure that i succeeded after all though wearied with his so pertinaciously returning to the same point and repeating the same arguments over and over again forcing me to reiterate the same replies i at length turned short and sharp upon him and my last words werei tell you plainly that it cannot be
no consideration can induce me to marry against my inclinations
i respect youat least i would respect you if you would behave like a sensible manbut i cannot love you and never couldand the more you talk the further you repel me so pray dont say any more about it whereupon he wished me a goodmorning and withdrew disconcerted and offended no doubt but surely it was not my fault
the next day i accompanied my uncle and aunt to a dinnerparty at mr wilmots
he had two ladies staying with him his niece annabella a fine dashing girl or rather young womanof some fiveandtwenty too great a flirt to be married according to her own assertion but greatly admired by the gentlemen who universally pronounced her a splendid woman and her gentle cousin milicent hargrave who had taken a violent fancy to me mistaking me for something vastly better than i was
and i in return was very fond of her
i should entirely exclude poor milicent in my general animadversions against the ladies of my acquaintance
but it was not on her account or her cousins that i have mentioned the party it was for the sake of another of mr wilmots guests to wit mr huntingdon
i have good reason to remember his presence there for this was the last time i saw him
he did not sit near me at dinner for it was his fate to hand in a capacious old dowager and mine to be handed in by mr grimsby a friend of his but a man i very greatly disliked there was a sinister cast in his countenance and a mixture of lurking ferocity and fulsome insincerity in his demeanour that i could not away with
what a tiresome custom that is bythebyone among the many sources of factitious annoyance of this ultracivilised life
if the gentlemen must lead the ladies into the diningroom why cannot they take those they like best
i am not sure however that mr huntingdon would have taken me if he had been at liberty to make his own selection
it is quite possible he might have chosen miss wilmot for she seemed bent upon engrossing his attention to herself and he seemed nothing loth to pay the homage she demanded
i thought so at least when i saw how they talked and laughed and glanced across the table to the neglect and evident umbrage of their respective neighboursand afterwards as the gentlemen joined us in the drawingroom when she immediately upon his entrance loudly called upon him to be the arbiter of a dispute between herself and another lady and he answered the summons with alacrity and decided the question without a moments hesitation in her favourthough to my thinking she was obviously in the wrongand then stood chatting familiarly with her and a group of other ladies while i sat with milicent hargrave at the opposite end of the room looking over the latters drawings and aiding her with my critical observations and advice at her particular desire
but in spite of my efforts to remain composed my attention wandered from the drawings to the merry group and against my better judgment my wrath rose and doubtless my countenance lowered for milicent observing that i must be tired of her daubs and scratches begged i would join the company now and defer the examination of the remainder to another opportunity
but while i was assuring her that i had no wish to join them and was not tired mr huntingdon himself came up to the little round table at which we sat
are these yours said he carelessly taking up one of the drawings
no they are miss hargraves oh
well lets have a look at them and regardless of miss hargraves protestations that they were not worth looking at he drew a chair to my side and receiving the drawings one by one from my hand successively scanned them over and threw them on the table but said not a word about them though he was talking all the time
i dont know what milicent hargrave thought of such conduct but i found his conversation extremely interesting though as i afterwards discovered when i came to analyse it it was chiefly confined to quizzing the different members of the company present and albeit he made some clever remarks and some excessively droll ones i do not think the whole would appear anything very particular if written here without the adventitious aids of look and tone and gesture and that ineffable but indefinite charm which cast a halo over all he did and said and which would have made it a delight to look in his face and hear the music of his voice if he had been talking positive nonsenseand which moreover made me feel so bitter against my aunt when she put a stop to this enjoyment by coming composedly forward under pretence of wishing to see the drawings that she cared and knew nothing about and while making believe to examine them addressing herself to mr huntingdon with one of her coldest and most repellent aspects and beginning a series of the most commonplace and formidably formal questions and observations on purpose to wrest his attention from meon purpose to vex me as i thought and having now looked through the portfolio i left them to their ttette and seated myself on a sofa quite apart from the companynever thinking how strange such conduct would appear but merely to indulge at first the vexation of the moment and subsequently to enjoy my private thoughts
but i was not left long alone for mr wilmot of all men the least welcome took advantage of my isolated position to come and plant himself beside me
i had flattered myself that i had so effectually repulsed his advances on all former occasions that i had nothing more to apprehend from his unfortunate predilection but it seems i was mistaken so great was his confidence either in his wealth or his remaining powers of attraction and so firm his conviction of feminine weakness that he thought himself warranted to return to the siege which he did with renovated ardour enkindled by the quantity of wine he had drunka circumstance that rendered him infinitely the more disgusting but greatly as i abhorred him at that moment i did not like to treat him with rudeness as i was now his guest and had just been enjoying his hospitality and i was no hand at a polite but determined rejection nor would it have greatly availed me if i had for he was too coarseminded to take any repulse that was not as plain and positive as his own effrontery
the consequence was that he waxed more fulsomely tender and more repulsively warm and i was driven to the very verge of desperation and about to say i know not what when i felt my hand that hung over the arm of the sofa suddenly taken by another and gently but fervently pressed
instinctively i guessed who it was and on looking up was less surprised than delighted to see mr huntingdon smiling upon me
it was like turning from some purgatorial fiend to an angel of light come to announce that the season of torment was past
helen said he he frequently called me helen and i never resented the freedom i want you to look at this picture
mr wilmot will excuse you a moment im sure i rose with alacrity
he drew my arm within his and led me across the room to a splendid painting of vandykes that i had noticed before but not sufficiently examined
after a moment of silent contemplation i was beginning to comment on its beauties and peculiarities when playfully pressing the hand he still retained within his arm he interrupted me withnever mind the picture it was not for that i brought you here it was to get you away from that scoundrelly old profligate yonder who is looking as if he would like to challenge me for the affront i am very much obliged to you said i
this is twice you have delivered me from such unpleasant companionship dont be too thankful he answered it is not all kindness to you it is partly from a feeling of spite to your tormentors that makes me delighted to do the old fellows a bad turn though i dont think i have any great reason to dread them as rivals
have i helen you know i detest them both and me i have no reason to detest you but what are your sentiments towards me
helenspeak
how do you regard me and again he pressed my hand but i feared there was more of conscious power than tenderness in his demeanour and i felt he had no right to extort a confession of attachment from me when he had made no correspondent avowal himself and knew not what to answer
at last i said how do you regard me sweet angel i adore you
i helen i want you a moment said the distinct low voice of my aunt close beside us
and i left him muttering maledictions against his evil angel
well aunt what is it
what do you want said i following her to the embrasure of the window
i want you to join the company when you are fit to be seen returned she severely regarding me but please to stay here a little till that shocking colour is somewhat abated and your eyes have recovered something of their natural expression
i should be ashamed for anyone to see you in your present state of course such a remark had no effect in reducing the shocking colour on the contrary i felt my face glow with redoubled fires kindled by a complication of emotions of which indignant swelling anger was the chief
i offered no reply however but pushed aside the curtain and looked into the nightor rather into the lamplit square
was mr huntingdon proposing to you helen inquired my too watchful relative
no what was he saying then
i heard something very like it i dont know what he would have said if you hadnt interrupted him and would you have accepted him helen if he had proposed of course notwithout consulting uncle and you oh
im glad my dear you have so much prudence left
well now she added after a moments pause you have made yourself conspicuous enough for one evening
the ladies are directing inquiring glances towards us at this moment i see i shall join them
do you come too when you are sufficiently composed to appear as usual i am so now speak gently then and dont look so malicious said my calm but provoking aunt
we shall return home shortly and then she added with solemn significance i have much to say to you so i went home prepared for a formidable lecture
little was said by either party in the carriage during our short transit homewards but when i had entered my room and thrown myself into an easychair to reflect on the events of the day my aunt followed me thither and having dismissed rachel who was carefully stowing away my ornaments closed the door and placing a chair beside me or rather at right angles with mine sat down
with due deference i offered her my more commodious seat
she declined it and thus opened the conference do you remember helen our conversation the night but one before we left staningley yes aunt and do you remember how i warned you against letting your heart be stolen from you by those unworthy of its possession and fixing your affections where approbation did not go before and where reason and judgment withheld their sanction yes but my reason pardon meand do you remember assuring me that there was no occasion for uneasiness on your account for you should never be tempted to marry a man who was deficient in sense or principle however handsome or charming in other respects he might be for you could not love him you should hatedespisepityanything but love himwere not those your words yes but and did you not say that your affection must be founded on approbation and that unless you could approve and honour and respect you could not love yes but i do approve and honour and respect how so my dear
is mr huntingdon a good man he is a much better man than you think him that is nothing to the purpose
is he a good man yesin some respects
he has a good disposition is he a man of principle perhaps not exactly but it is only for want of thought
if he had some one to advise him and remind him of what is right he would soon learn you thinkand you yourself would willingly undertake to be his teacher
but my dear he is i believe full ten years older than youhow is it that you are so beforehand in moral acquirements thanks to you aunt i have been well brought up and had good examples always before me which he most likely has not and besides he is of a sanguine temperament and a gay thoughtless temper and i am naturally inclined to reflection well now you have made him out to be deficient in both sense and principle by your own confession then my sense and my principle are at his service that sounds presumptuous helen
do you think you have enough for both and do you imagine your merry thoughtless profligate would allow himself to be guided by a young girl like you no i should not wish to guide him but i think i might have influence sufficient to save him from some errors and i should think my life well spent in the effort to preserve so noble a nature from destruction
he always listens attentively now when i speak seriously to him and i often venture to reprove his random way of talking and sometimes he says that if he had me always by his side he should never do or say a wicked thing and that a little daily talk with me would make him quite a saint
it may he partly jest and partly flattery but still but still you think it may be truth if i do think there is any mixture of truth in it it is not from confidence in my own powers but in his natural goodness
and you have no right to call him a profligate aunt he is nothing of the kind who told you so my dear
what was that story about his intrigue with a married ladylady who was itmiss wilmot herself was telling you the other day it was falsefalse i cried
i dont believe a word of it you think then that he is a virtuous wellconducted young man i know nothing positive respecting his character
i only know that i have heard nothing definite against itnothing that could be proved at least and till people can prove their slanderous accusations i will not believe them
and i know this that if he has committed errors they are only such as are common to youth and such as nobody thinks anything about for i see that everybody likes him and all the mammas smile upon him and their daughtersand miss wilmot herselfare only too glad to attract his attention helen the world may look upon such offences as venial a few unprincipled mothers may be anxious to catch a young man of fortune without reference may his character and thoughtless girls may be glad to win the smiles of so handsome a gentleman without seeking to penetrate beyond the surface but you i trusted were better informed than to see with their eyes and judge with their perverted judgment
i did not think you would call these venial errors nor do i aunt but if i hate the sins i love the sinner and would do much for his salvation even supposing your suspicions to be mainly true which i do not and will not believe well my dear ask your uncle what sort of company he keeps and if he is not banded with a set of loose profligate young men whom he calls his friends his jolly companions and whose chief delight is to wallow in vice and vie with each other who can run fastest and furthest down the headlong road to the place prepared for the devil and his angels then i will save him from them oh helen helen
you little know the misery of uniting your fortunes to such a man i have such confidence in him aunt notwithstanding all you say that i would willingly risk my happiness for the chance of securing his
i will leave better men to those who only consider their own advantage
if he has done amiss i shall consider my life well spent in saving him from the consequences of his early errors and striving to recall him to the path of virtue
god grant me success here the conversation ended for at this juncture my uncles voice was heard from his chamber loudly calling upon my aunt to come to bed
he was in a bad humour that night for his gout was worse
it had been gradually increasing upon him ever since we came to town and my aunt took advantage of the circumstance next morning to persuade him to return to the country immediately without waiting for the close of the season
his physician supported and enforced her arguments and contrary to her usual habits she so hurried the preparations for removal as much for my sake as my uncles i think that in a very few days we departed and i saw no more of mr huntingdon
my aunt flatters herself i shall soon forget himperhaps she thinks i have forgotten him already for i never mention his name and she may continue to think so till we meet againif ever that should be
i wonder if it will
august thi am now quite settled down to my usual routine of steady occupations and quiet amusementstolerably contented and cheerful but still looking forward to spring with the hope of returning to town not for its gaieties and dissipations but for the chance of meeting mr huntingdon once again for still he is always in my thoughts and in my dreams
in all my employments whatever i do or see or hear has an ultimate reference to him whatever skill or knowledge i acquire is some day to be turned to his advantage or amusement whatever new beauties in nature or art i discover are to be depicted to meet his eye or stored in my memory to be told him at some future period
this at least is the hope that i cherish the fancy that lights me on my lonely way
it may be only an ignis fatuus after all but it can do no harm to follow it with my eyes and rejoice in its lustre as long as it does not lure me from the path i ought to keep and i think it will not for i have thought deeply on my aunts advice and i see clearly now the folly of throwing myself away on one that is unworthy of all the love i have to give and incapable of responding to the best and deepest feelings of my inmost heartso clearly that even if i should see him again and if he should remember me and love me still which alas
is too little probable considering how he is situated and by whom surrounded and if he should ask me to marry himi am determined not to consent until i know for certain whether my aunts opinion of him or mine is nearest the truth for if mine is altogether wrong it is not he that i love it is a creature of my own imagination
but i think it is not wrongno nothere is a secret somethingan inward instinct that assures me i am right
there is essential goodness in himand what delight to unfold it
if he has wandered what bliss to recall him
if he is now exposed to the baneful influence of corrupting and wicked companions what glory to deliver him from them
oh
if i could but believe that heaven has designed me for this
today is the first of september but my uncle has ordered the gamekeeper to spare the partridges till the gentlemen come
what gentlemen i asked when i heard it
a small party he had invited to shoot
his friend mr wilmot was one and my aunts friend mr boarham another
this struck me as terrible news at the moment but all regret and apprehension vanished like a dream when i heard that mr huntingdon was actually to be a third
my aunt is greatly against his coming of course she earnestly endeavoured to dissuade my uncle from asking him but he laughing at her objections told her it was no use talking for the mischief was already done he had invited huntingdon and his friend lord lowborough before we left london and nothing now remained but to fix the day for their coming
so he is safe and i am sure of seeing him
i cannot express my joy
i find it very difficult to conceal it from my aunt but i dont wish to trouble her with my feelings till i know whether i ought to indulge them or not
if i find it my absolute duty to suppress them they shall trouble no one but myself and if i can really feel myself justified in indulging this attachment i can dare anything even the anger and grief of my best friend for its objectsurely i shall soon know
but they are not coming till about the middle of the month
we are to have two lady visitors also mr wilmot is to bring his niece and her cousin milicent
i suppose my aunt thinks the latter will benefit me by her society and the salutary example of her gentle deportment and lowly and tractable spirit and the former i suspect she intends as a species of counterattraction to win mr huntingdons attention from me
i dont thank her for this but i shall be glad of milicents company she is a sweet good girl and i wish i were like hermore like her at least than i am
ththey are come
they came the day before yesterday
the gentlemen are all gone out to shoot and the ladies are with my aunt at work in the drawingroom
i have retired to the library for i am very unhappy and i want to be alone
books cannot divert me so having opened my desk i will try what may be done by detailing the cause of my uneasiness
this paper will serve instead of a confidential friend into whose ear i might pour forth the overflowings of my heart
it will not sympathise with my distresses but then it will not laugh at them and if i keep it close it cannot tell again so it is perhaps the best friend i could have for the purpose
first let me speak of his arrivalhow i sat at my window and watched for nearly two hours before his carriage entered the parkgatesfor they all came before himand how deeply i was disappointed at every arrival because it was not his
first came mr wilmot and the ladies
when milicent had got into her room i quitted my post a few minutes to look in upon her and have a little private conversation for she was now my intimate friend several long epistles having passed between us since our parting
on returning to my window i beheld another carriage at the door
was it his
no it was mr boarhams plain dark chariot and there stood he upon the steps carefully superintending the dislodging of his various boxes and packages
what a collection
one would have thought he projected a visit of six months at least
a considerable time after came lord lowborough in his barouche
is he one of the profligate friends i wonder
i should think not for no one could call him a jolly companion im sureand besides he appears too sober and gentlemanly in his demeanour to merit such suspicions
he is a tall thin gloomylooking man apparently between thirty and forty and of a somewhat sickly careworn aspect
at last mr huntingdons light phaeton came bowling merrily up the lawn
i had but a transient glimpse of him for the moment it stopped he sprang out over the side on to the portico steps and disappeared into the house
i now submitted to be dressed for dinnera duty which rachel had been urging upon me for the last twenty minutes and when that important business was completed i repaired to the drawingroom where i found mr and miss wilmot and milicent hargrave already assembled
shortly after lord lowborough entered and then mr boarham who seemed quite willing to forget and forgive my former conduct and to hope that a little conciliation and steady perseverance on his part might yet succeed in bringing me to reason
while i stood at the window conversing with milicent he came up to me and was beginning to talk in nearly his usual strain when mr huntingdon entered the room
how will he greet me i wonder said my bounding heart and instead of advancing to meet him i turned to the window to hide or subdue my emotion
but having saluted his host and hostess and the rest of the company he came to me ardently squeezed my hand and murmured he was glad to see me once again
at that moment dinner was announced my aunt desired him to take miss hargrave into the diningroom and odious mr wilmot with unspeakable grimaces offered his arm to me and i was condemned to sit between himself and mr boarham
but afterwards when we were all again assembled in the drawingroom i was indemnified for so much suffering by a few delightful minutes of conversation with mr huntingdon
in the course of the evening miss wilmot was called upon to sing and play for the amusement of the company and i to exhibit my drawings and though he likes music and she is an accomplished musician i think i am right in affirming that he paid more attention to my drawings than to her music
so far so goodbut hearing him pronounce sotto voce but with peculiar emphasis concerning one of the pieces this is better than alli looked up curious to see which it was and to my horror beheld him complacently gazing at the back of the pictureit was his own face that i had sketched there and forgotten to rub out
to make matters worse in the agony of the moment i attempted to snatch it from his hand but he prevented me and exclaiming noby george ill keep it placed it against his waistcoat and buttoned his coat upon it with a delighted chuckle
then drawing a candle close to his elbow he gathered all the drawings to himself as well what he had seen as the others and muttering i must look at both sides now he eagerly commenced an examination which i watched at first with tolerable composure in the confidence that his vanity would not be gratified by any further discoveries for though i must plead guilty to having disfigured the backs of several with abortive attempts to delineate that too fascinating physiognomy i was sure that with that one unfortunate exception i had carefully obliterated all such witnesses of my infatuation
but the pencil frequently leaves an impression upon cardboard that no amount of rubbing can efface
such it seems was the case with most of these and i confess i trembled when i saw him holding them so close to the candle and poring so intently over the seeming blanks but still i trusted he would not be able to make out these dim traces to his own satisfaction
i was mistaken however
having ended his scrutiny he quietly remarkedi perceive the backs of young ladies drawings like the postscripts of their letters are the most important and interesting part of the concern then leaning back in his chair he reflected a few minutes in silence complacently smiling to himself and while i was concocting some cutting speech wherewith to check his gratification he rose and passing over to where annabella wilmot sat vehemently coquetting with lord lowborough seated himself on the sofa beside her and attached himself to her for the rest of the evening
so then thought i he despises me because he knows i love him and the reflection made me so miserable i knew not what to do
milicent came and began to admire my drawings and make remarks upon them but i could not talk to heri could talk to no one and upon the introduction of tea i took advantage of the open door and the slight diversion caused by its entrance to slip outfor i was sure i could not take anyand take refuge in the library
my aunt sent thomas in quest of me to ask if i were not coming to tea but i bade him say i should not take any tonight and happily she was too much occupied with her guests to make any further inquiries at the time
as most of the company had travelled far that day they retired early to rest and having heard them all as i thought go upstairs i ventured out to get my candlestick from the drawingroom sideboard
but mr huntingdon had lingered behind the rest
he was just at the foot of the stairs when i opened the door and hearing my step in the hallthough i could hardly hear it myselfhe instantly turned back
helen is that you said he
why did you run away from us goodnight mr huntingdon said i coldly not choosing to answer the question
and i turned away to enter the drawingroom
but youll shake hands wont you said he placing himself in the doorway before me
and he seized my hand and held it much against my will
let me go mr huntingdon said i
i want to get a candle the candle will keep returned he
i made a desperate effort to free my hand from his grasp
why are you in such a hurry to leave me helen he said with a smile of the most provoking selfsufficiency
you dont hate me you know yes i doat this moment not you
it is annabella wilmot you hate not me i have nothing to do with annabella wilmot said i burning with indignation
but i have you know returned he with peculiar emphasis
that is nothing to me sir i retorted
is it nothing to you helen
will you swear it
will you no i wont mr huntingdon
and i will go cried i not knowing whether to laugh or to cry or to break out into a tempest of fury
go then you vixen he said but the instant he released my hand he had the audacity to put his arm round my neck and kiss me
trembling with anger and agitation and i dont know what besides i broke away and got my candle and rushed upstairs to my room
he would not have done so but for that hateful picture
and there he had it still in his possession an eternal monument to his pride and my humiliation
it was but little sleep i got that night and in the morning i rose perplexed and troubled with the thoughts of meeting him at breakfast
i knew not how it was to be done
an assumption of dignified cold indifference would hardly do after what he knew of my devotionto his face at least
yet something must be done to check his presumptioni would not submit to be tyrannised over by those bright laughing eyes
and accordingly i received his cheerful morning salutation as calmly and coldly as my aunt could have wished and defeated with brief answers his one or two attempts to draw me into conversation while i comported myself with unusual cheerfulness and complaisance towards every other member of the party especially annabella wilmot and even her uncle and mr boarham were treated with an extra amount of civility on the occasion not from any motives of coquetry but just to show him that my particular coolness and reserve arose from no general illhumour or depression of spirits
he was not however to be repelled by such acting as this
he did not talk much to me but when he did speak it was with a degree of freedom and openness and kindliness too that plainly seemed to intimate he knew his words were music to my ears and when his looks met mine it was with a smilepresumptuous it might bebut oh
so sweet so bright so genial that i could not possibly retain my anger every vestige of displeasure soon melted away beneath it like morning clouds before the summer sun
soon after breakfast all the gentlemen save one with boyish eagerness set out on their expedition against the hapless partridges my uncle and mr wilmot on their shooting ponies mr huntingdon and lord lowborough on their legs the one exception being mr boarham who in consideration of the rain that had fallen during the night thought it prudent to remain behind a little and join them in a while when the sun had dried the grass
and he favoured us all with a long and minute disquisition upon the evils and dangers attendant upon damp feet delivered with the most imperturbable gravity amid the jeers and laughter of mr huntingdon and my uncle who leaving the prudent sportsman to entertain the ladies with his medical discussions sallied forth with their guns bending their steps to the stables first to have a look at the horses and let out the dogs
not desirous of sharing mr boarhams company for the whole of the morning i betook myself to the library and there brought forth my easel and began to paint
the easel and the painting apparatus would serve as an excuse for abandoning the drawingroom if my aunt should come to complain of the desertion and besides i wanted to finish the picture
it was one i had taken great pains with and i intended it to be my masterpiece though it was somewhat presumptuous in the design
by the bright azure of the sky and by the warm and brilliant lights and deep long shadows i had endeavoured to convey the idea of a sunny morning
i had ventured to give more of the bright verdure of spring or early summer to the grass and foliage than is commonly attempted in painting
the scene represented was an open glade in a wood
a group of dark scotch firs was introduced in the middle distance to relieve the prevailing freshness of the rest but in the foreground was part of the gnarled trunk and of the spreading boughs of a large foresttree whose foliage was of a brilliant golden greennot golden from autumnal mellowness but from the sunshine and the very immaturity of the scarce expanded leaves
upon this bough that stood out in bold relief against the sombre firs were seated an amorous pair of turtle doves whose soft sadcoloured plumage afforded a contrast of another nature and beneath it a young girl was kneeling on the daisyspangled turf with head thrown back and masses of fair hair falling on her shoulders her hands clasped lips parted and eyes intently gazing upward in pleased yet earnest contemplation of those feathered loverstoo deeply absorbed in each other to notice her
i had scarcely settled to my work which however wanted but a few touches to the finishing when the sportsmen passed the window on their return from the stables
it was partly open and mr huntingdon must have seen me as he went by for in half a minute he came back and setting his gun against the wall threw up the sash and sprang in and set himself before my picture
very pretty ifaith said he after attentively regarding it for a few seconds and a very fitting study for a young lady
spring just opening into summermorning just approaching noongirlhood just ripening into womanhood and hope just verging on fruition
shes a sweet creature
but why didnt you make her black hair i thought light hair would suit her better
you see i have made her blueeyed and plump and fair and rosy upon my worda very hebe
i should fall in love with her if i hadnt the artist before me
sweet innocent
shes thinking there will come a time when she will be wooed and won like that pretty hendove by as fond and fervent a lover and shes thinking how pleasant it will be and how tender and faithful he will find her and perhaps suggested i how tender and faithful she shall find him perhaps for there is no limit to the wild extravagance of hopes imaginings at such an age do you call that then one of her wild extravagant delusions no my heart tells me it is not
i might have thought so once but now i say give me the girl i love and i will swear eternal constancy to her and her alone through summer and winter through youth and age and life and death
if age and death must come he spoke this in such serious earnest that my heart bounded with delight but the minute after he changed his tone and asked with a significant smile if i had any more portraits no replied i reddening with confusion and wrath
but my portfolio was on the table he took it up and coolly sat down to examine its contents
mr
huntingdon those are my unfinished sketches cried i and i never let any one see them and i placed my hand on the portfolio to wrest it from him but he maintained his hold assuring me that he liked unfinished sketches of all things but i hate them to be seen returned i
i cant let you have it indeed let me have its bowels then said he and just as i wrenched the portfolio from his hand he deftly abstracted the greater part of its contents and after turning them over a moment he cried outbless my stars heres another and slipped a small oval of ivory paper into his waistcoat pocketa complete miniature portrait that i had sketched with such tolerable success as to be induced to colour it with great pains and care
but i was determined he should not keep it
mr
huntingdon cried i i insist upon having that back
it is mine and you have no right to take it
give it me directlyill never forgive you if you dont but the more vehemently i insisted the more he aggravated my distress by his insulting gleeful laugh
at length however he restored it to me sayingwell well since you value it so much ill not deprive you of it to show him how i valued it i tore it in two and threw it into the fire
he was not prepared for this
his merriment suddenly ceasing he stared in mute amazement at the consuming treasure and then with a careless humph
ill go and shoot now he turned on his heel and vacated the apartment by the window as he came and setting on his hat with an air took up his gun and walked away whistling as he wentand leaving me not too much agitated to finish my picture for i was glad at the moment that i had vexed him
when i returned to the drawingroom i found mr boarham had ventured to follow his comrades to the field and shortly after lunch to which they did not think of returning i volunteered to accompany the ladies in a walk and show annabella and milicent the beauties of the country
we took a long ramble and reentered the park just as the sportsmen were returning from their expedition
toilspent and travelstained the main body of them crossed over the grass to avoid us but mr huntingdon all spattered and splashed as he was and stained with the blood of his preyto the no small offence of my aunts strict sense of proprietycame out of his way to meet us with cheerful smiles and words for all but me and placing himself between annabella wilmot and myself walked up the road and began to relate the various exploits and disasters of the day in a manner that would have convulsed me with laughter if i had been on good terms with him but he addressed himself entirely to annabella and i of course left all the laughter and all the badinage to her and affecting the utmost indifference to whatever passed between them walked along a few paces apart and looking every way but theirs while my aunt and milicent went before linked arm in arm and gravely discoursing together
at length mr huntingdon turned to me and addressing me in a confidential whisper saidhelen why did you burn my picture because i wished to destroy it i answered with an asperity it is useless now to lament
oh very good was the reply if you dont value me i must turn to somebody that will i thought it was partly in jesta halfplayful mixture of mock resignation and pretended indifference but immediately he resumed his place beside miss wilmot and from that hour to thisduring all that evening and all the next day and the next and the next and all this morning the nd he has never given me one kind word or one pleasant looknever spoken to me but from pure necessitynever glanced towards me but with a cold unfriendly look i thought him quite incapable of assuming
my aunt observes the change and though she has not inquired the cause or made any remark to me on the subject i see it gives her pleasure
miss wilmot observes it too and triumphantly ascribes it to her own superior charms and blandishments but i am truly miserablemore so than i like to acknowledge to myself
pride refuses to aid me
it has brought me into the scrape and will not help me out of it
he meant no harmit was only his joyous playful spirit and i by my acrimonious resentmentso serious so disproportioned to the offencehave so wounded his feelings so deeply offended him that i fear he will never forgive meand all for a mere jest
he thinks i dislike him and he must continue to think so
i must lose him for ever and annabella may win him and triumph as she will
but it is not my loss nor her triumph that i deplore so greatly as the wreck of my fond hopes for his advantage and her unworthiness of his affection and the injury he will do himself by trusting his happiness to her
she does not love him she thinks only of herself
she cannot appreciate the good that is in him she will neither see it nor value it nor cherish it
she will neither deplore his faults nor attempt their amendment but rather aggravate them by her own
and i doubt whether she will not deceive him after all
i see she is playing double between him and lord lowborough and while she amuses herself with the lively huntingdon she tries her utmost to enslave his moody friend and should she succeed in bringing both to her feet the fascinating commoner will have but little chance against the lordly peer
if he observes her artful byplay it gives him no uneasiness but rather adds new zest to his diversion by opposing a stimulating check to his otherwise too easy conquest
messrs wilmot and boarham have severally taken occasion by his neglect of me to renew their advances and if i were like annabella and some others i should take advantage of their perseverance to endeavour to pique him into a revival of affection but justice and honesty apart i could not bear to do it
i am annoyed enough by their present persecutions without encouraging them further and even if i did it would have precious little effect upon him
he sees me suffering under the condescending attentions and prosaic discourses of the one and the repulsive obtrusions of the other without so much as a shadow of commiseration for me or resentment against my tormentors
he never could have loved me or he would not have resigned me so willingly and he would not go on talking to everybody else so cheerfully as he doeslaughing and jesting with lord lowborough and my uncle teasing milicent hargrave and flirting with annabella wilmotas if nothing were on his mind
oh
why cant i hate him
i must be infatuated or i should scorn to regret him as i do
but i must rally all the powers i have remaining and try to tear him from my heart
there goes the dinnerbell and here comes my aunt to scold me for sitting here at my desk all day instead of staying with the company wish the company weregone
twentysecond nightwhat have i done
and what will be the end of it
i cannot calmly reflect upon it i cannot sleep
i must have recourse to my diary again i will commit it to paper tonight and see what i shall think of it tomorrow
i went down to dinner resolving to be cheerful and wellconducted and kept my resolution very creditably considering how my head ached and how internally wretched i felt
i dont know what is come over me of late my very energies both mental and physical must be strangely impaired or i should not have acted so weakly in many respects as i have done but i have not been well this last day or two
i suppose it is with sleeping and eating so little and thinking so much and being so continually out of humour
but to return
i was exerting myself to sing and play for the amusement and at the request of my aunt and milicent before the gentlemen came into the drawingroom miss wilmot never likes to waste her musical efforts on ladies ears alone
milicent had asked for a little scotch song and i was just in the middle of it when they entered
the first thing mr huntingdon did was to walk up to annabella
now miss wilmot wont you give us some music tonight said he
do now
i know you will when i tell you that i have been hungering and thirsting all day for the sound of your voice
come
the pianos vacant it was for i had quitted it immediately upon hearing his petition
had i been endowed with a proper degree of selfpossession i should have turned to the lady myself and cheerfully joined my entreaties to his whereby i should have disappointed his expectations if the affront had been purposely given or made him sensible of the wrong if it had only arisen from thoughtlessness but i felt it too deeply to do anything but rise from the musicstool and throw myself back on the sofa suppressing with difficulty the audible expression of the bitterness i felt within
i knew annabellas musical talents were superior to mine but that was no reason why i should be treated as a perfect nonentity
the time and the manner of his asking her appeared like a gratuitous insult to me and i could have wept with pure vexation
meantime she exultingly seated herself at the piano and favoured him with two of his favourite songs in such superior style that even i soon lost my anger in admiration and listened with a sort of gloomy pleasure to the skilful modulations of her fulltoned and powerful voice so judiciously aided by her rounded and spirited touch and while my ears drank in the sound my eyes rested on the face of her principal auditor and derived an equal or superior delight from the contemplation of his speaking countenance as he stood beside herthat eye and brow lighted up with keen enthusiasm and that sweet smile passing and appearing like gleams of sunshine on an april day
no wonder he should hunger and thirst to hear her sing
i now forgave him from my heart his reckless slight of me and i felt ashamed at my pettish resentment of such a trifleashamed too of those bitter envious pangs that gnawed my inmost heart in spite of all this admiration and delight
there now said she playfully running her fingers over the keys when she had concluded the second song
what shall i give you next but in saying this she looked back at lord lowborough who was standing a little behind leaning against the back of a chair an attentive listener too experiencing to judge by his countenance much the same feelings of mingled pleasure and sadness as i did
but the look she gave him plainly said do you choose for me now i have done enough for him and will gladly exert myself to gratify you and thus encouraged his lordship came forward and turning over the music presently set before her a little song that i had noticed before and read more than once with an interest arising from the circumstance of my connecting it in my mind with the reigning tyrant of my thoughts
and now with my nerves already excited and half unstrung i could not hear those words so sweetly warbled forth without some symptoms of emotion i was not able to suppress
tears rose unbidden to my eyes and i buried my face in the sofapillow that they might flow unseen while i listened
the air was simple sweet and sad
it is still running in my head and so are the words farewell to thee
but not farewell to all my fondest thoughts of thee within my heart they still shall dwell and they shall cheer and comfort me
o beautiful and full of grace
if thou hadst never met mine eye i had not dreamed a living face could fancied charms so far outvie
if i may neer behold again that form and face so dear to me nor hear thy voice still would i fain preserve for aye their memory
that voice the magic of whose tone can wake an echo in my breast creating feelings that alone can make my tranced spirit blest
that laughing eye whose sunny beam my memory would not cherish less and oh that smile
i whose joyous gleam no mortal languish can express
adieu
but let me cherish still the hope with which i cannot part
contempt may wound and coldness chill but still it lingers in my heart
and who can tell but heaven at last may answer all my thousand prayers and bid the future pay the past with joy for anguish smiles for tears
when it ceased i longed for nothing so much as to be out of the room
the sofa was not far from the door but i did not dare to raise my head for i knew mr huntingdon was standing near me and i knew by the sound of his voice as he spoke in answer to some remark of lord lowboroughs that his face was turned towards me
perhaps a halfsuppressed sob had caught his ear and caused him to look roundheaven forbid
but with a violent effort i checked all further signs of weakness dried my tears and when i thought he had turned away again rose and instantly left the apartment taking refuge in my favourite resort the library
there was no light there but the faint red glow of the neglected firebut i did not want a light i only wanted to indulge my thoughts unnoticed and undisturbed and sitting down on a low stool before the easychair i sunk my head upon its cushioned seat and thought and thought until the tears gushed out again and i wept like any child
presently however the door was gently opened and someone entered the room
i trusted it was only a servant and did not stir
the door was closed againbut i was not alone a hand gently touched my shoulder and a voice said softlyhelen what is the matter i could not answer at the moment
you must and shall tell me was added more vehemently and the speaker threw himself on his knees beside me on the rug and forcibly possessed himself of my hand but i hastily caught it away and repliedit is nothing to you mr huntingdon are you sure it is nothing to me he returned can you swear that you were not thinking of me while you wept this was unendurable
i made an effort to rise but he was kneeling on my dress
tell me continued hei want to knowbecause if you were i have something to say to youand if not ill go go then i cried but fearing he would obey too well and never come again i hastily addedor say what you have to say and have done with it but which said hefor i shall only say it if you really were thinking of me
so tell me helen youre excessively impertinent mr huntingdon not at alltoo pertinent you mean
so you wont tell mewell ill spare your womans pride and construing your silence into yes ill take it for granted that i was the subject of your thoughts and the cause of your affliction indeed sir if you deny it i wont tell you my secret threatened he and i did not interrupt him again or even attempt to repulse him though he had taken my hand once more and half embraced me with his other arm i was scarcely conscious of it at the time
it is this resumed he that annabella wilmot in comparison with you is like a flaunting peony compared with a sweet wild rosebud gemmed with dewand i love you to distractionnow tell me if that intelligence gives you any pleasure
silence again
that means yes
then let me add that i cannot live without you and if you answer no to this last question you will drive me madwill you bestow yourself upon meyou will he cried nearly squeezing me to death in his arms
no no i exclaimed struggling to free myself from himyou must ask my uncle and aunt they wont refuse me if you dont im not so sure of thatmy aunt dislikes you but you dont helensay you love me and ill go i wish you would go i replied
i will this instantif youll only say you love me you know i do i answered
and again he caught me in his arms and smothered me with kisses
at that moment my aunt opened wide the door and stood before us candle in hand in shocked and horrified amazement gazing alternately at mr huntingdon and mefor we had both started up and now stood wide enough asunder
but his confusion was only for a moment
rallying in an instant with the most enviable assurance he begani beg ten thousand pardons mrs maxwell
dont be too severe upon me
ive been asking your sweet niece to take me for better for worse and she like a good girl informs me she cannot think of it without her uncles and aunts consent
so let me implore you not to condemn me to eternal wretchedness if you favour my cause i am safe for mr maxwell i am certain can refuse you nothing we will talk of this tomorrow sir said my aunt coldly
it is a subject that demands mature and serious deliberation
at present you had better return to the drawingroom but meantime pleaded he let me commend my cause to your most indulgent no indulgence for you mr huntingdon must come between me and the consideration of my nieces happiness ah true
i know she is an angel and i am a presumptuous dog to dream of possessing such a treasure but nevertheless i would sooner die than relinquish her in favour of the best man that ever went to heavenand as for her happiness i would sacrifice my body and soul body and soul mr huntingdonsacrifice your soul well i would lay down life you would not be required to lay it down i would spend it thendevote my lifeand all its powers to the promotion and preservation another time sir we will talk of thisand i should have felt disposed to judge more favourably of your pretensions if you too had chosen another time and place and let me addanother manner for your declaration why you see mrs maxwell he began pardon me sir said she with dignitythe company are inquiring for you in the other room and she turned to me
then you must plead for me helen said he and at length withdrew
you had better retire to your room helen said my aunt gravely
i will discuss this matter with you too tomorrow dont be angry aunt said i
my dear i am not angry she replied i am surprised
if it is true that you told him you could not accept his offer without our consent it is true interrupted i
then how could you permit i couldnt help it aunt i cried bursting into tears
they were not altogether the tears of sorrow or of fear for her displeasure but rather the outbreak of the general tumultuous excitement of my feelings
but my good aunt was touched at my agitation
in a softer tone she repeated her recommendation to retire and gently kissing my forehead bade me goodnight and put her candle in my hand and i went but my brain worked so i could not think of sleeping
i feel calmer now that i have written all this and i will go to bed and try to win tired natures sweet restorer
september thin the morning i rose light and cheerfulnay intensely happy
the hovering cloud cast over me by my aunts views and by the fear of not obtaining her consent was lost in the bright effulgence of my own hopes and the too delightful consciousness of requited love
it was a splendid morning and i went out to enjoy it in a quiet ramble in company with my own blissful thoughts
the dew was on the grass and ten thousand gossamers were waving in the breeze the happy redbreast was pouring out its little soul in song and my heart overflowed with silent hymns of gratitude and praise to heaven
but i had not wandered far before my solitude was interrupted by the only person that could have disturbed my musings at that moment without being looked upon as an unwelcome intruder mr huntingdon came suddenly upon me
so unexpected was the apparition that i might have thought it the creation of an overexcited imagination had the sense of sight alone borne witness to his presence but immediately i felt his strong arm round my waist and his warm kiss on my cheek while his keen and gleeful salutation my own helen was ringing in my ear
not yours yet said i hastily swerving aside from this too presumptuous greeting
remember my guardians
you will not easily obtain my aunts consent
dont you see she is prejudiced against you i do dearest and you must tell me why that i may best know how to combat her objections
i suppose she thinks i am a prodigal pursued he observing that i was unwilling to reply and concludes that i shall have but little worldly goods wherewith to endow my better half
if so you must tell her that my property is mostly entailed and i cannot get rid of it
there may be a few mortgages on the resta few trifling debts and incumbrances here and there but nothing to speak of and though i acknowledge i am not so rich as i might beor have beenstill i think we could manage pretty comfortably on whats left
my father you know was something of a miser and in his latter days especially saw no pleasure in life but to amass riches and so it is no wonder that his son should make it his chief delight to spend them which was accordingly the case until my acquaintance with you dear helen taught me other views and nobler aims
and the very idea of having you to care for under my roof would force me to moderate my expenses and live like a christiannot to speak of all the prudence and virtue you would instil into my mind by your wise counsels and sweet attractive goodness but it is not that said i it is not money my aunt thinks about
she knows better than to value worldly wealth above its price what is it then she wishes me toto marry none but a really good man what a man of decided pietyahemwell come ill manage that too
its sunday today isnt it
ill go to church morning afternoon and evening and comport myself in such a godly sort that she shall regard me with admiration and sisterly love as a brand plucked from the burning
ill come home sighing like a furnace and full of the savour and unction of dear mr blatants discourse mr
leighton said i dryly
is mr leighton a sweet preacher helena dear delightful heavenlyminded man he is a good man mr huntingdon
i wish i could say half as much for you oh i forgot you are a saint too
i crave your pardon dearestbut dont call me mr huntingdon my name is arthur ill call you nothingfor ill have nothing at all to do with you if you talk in that way any more
if you really mean to deceive my aunt as you say you are very wicked and if not you are very wrong to jest on such a subject i stand corrected said he concluding his laugh with a sorrowful sigh
now resumed he after a momentary pause let us talk about something else
and come nearer to me helen and take my arm and then ill let you alone
i cant be quiet while i see you walking there i complied but said we must soon return to the house
no one will be down to breakfast yet for long enough he answered
you spoke of your guardians just now helen but is not your father still living yes but i always look upon my uncle and aunt as my guardians for they are so in deed though not in name
my father has entirely given me up to their care
i have never seen him since dear mamma died when i was a very little girl and my aunt at her request offered to take charge of me and took me away to staningley where i have remained ever since and i dont think he would object to anything for me that she thought proper to sanction but would he sanction anything to which she thought proper to object no i dont think he cares enough about me he is very much to blamebut he doesnt know what an angel he has for his daughterwhich is all the better for me as if he did he would not be willing to part with such a treasure and mr huntingdon said i i suppose you know i am not an heiress he protested he had never given it a thought and begged i would not disturb his present enjoyment by the mention of such uninteresting subjects
i was glad of this proof of disinterested affection for annabella wilmot is the probable heiress to all her uncles wealth in addition to her late fathers property which she has already in possession
i now insisted upon retracing our steps to the house but we walked slowly and went on talking as we proceeded
i need not repeat all we said let me rather refer to what passed between my aunt and me after breakfast when mr huntingdon called my uncle aside no doubt to make his proposals and she beckoned me into another room where she once more commenced a solemn remonstrance which however entirely failed to convince me that her view of the case was preferable to my own
you judge him uncharitably aunt i know said i
his very friends are not half so bad as you represent them
there is walter hargrave milicents brother for one he is but a little lower than the angels if half she says of him is true
she is continually talking to me about him and lauding his many virtues to the skies you will form a very inadequate estimate of a mans character replied she if you judge by what a fond sister says of him
the worst of them generally know how to hide their misdeeds from their sisters eyes and their mothers too and there is lord lowborough continued i quite a decent man who told you so
lord lowborough is a desperate man
he has dissipated his fortune in gambling and other things and is now seeking an heiress to retrieve it
i told miss wilmot so but youre all alike she haughtily answered she was very much obliged to me but she believed she knew when a man was seeking her for her fortune and when for herself she flattered herself she had had experience enough in those matters to be justified in trusting to her own judgmentand as for his lordships lack of fortune she cared nothing about that as she hoped her own would suffice for both and as for his wildness she supposed he was no worse than othersbesides he was reformed now
yes they can all play the hypocrite when they want to take in a fond misguided woman well i think hes about as good as she is said i
but when mr huntingdon is married he wont have many opportunities of consorting with his bachelor friendsand the worse they are the more i long to deliver him from them to be sure my dear and the worse he is i suppose the more you long to deliver him from himself yes provided he is not incorrigiblethat is the more i long to deliver him from his faultsto give him an opportunity of shaking off the adventitious evil got from contact with others worse than himself and shining out in the unclouded light of his own genuine goodnessto do my utmost to help his better self against his worse and make him what he would have been if he had not from the beginning had a bad selfish miserly father who to gratify his own sordid passions restricted him in the most innocent enjoyments of childhood and youth and so disgusted him with every kind of restraintand a foolish mother who indulged him to the top of his bent deceiving her husband for him and doing her utmost to encourage those germs of folly and vice it was her duty to suppressand then such a set of companions as you represent his friends to be poor man said she sarcastically his kind have greatly wronged him they have cried iand they shall wrong him no morehis wife shall undo what his mother did well said she after a short pause i must say helen i thought better of your judgment than thisand your taste too
how you can love such a man i cannot tell or what pleasure you can find in his company for what fellowship hath light with darkness or he that believeth with an infidel he is not an infideland i am not light and he is not darkness his worst and only vice is thoughtlessness and thoughtlessness pursued my aunt may lead to every crime and will but poorly excuse our errors in the sight of god
mr huntingdon i suppose is not without the common faculties of men he is not so lightheaded as to be irresponsible his maker has endowed him with reason and conscience as well as the rest of us the scriptures are open to him as well as to othersand if he hear not them neither will he hear though one rose from the dead and remember helen continued she solemnly the wicked shall be turned into hell and they that forget god and suppose even that he should continue to love you and you him and that you should pass through life together with tolerable comforthow will it be in the end when you see yourselves parted for ever you perhaps taken into eternal bliss and he cast into the lake that burneth with unquenchable firethere for ever to not for ever i exclaimed only till he has paid the uttermost farthing for if any mans work abide not the fire he shall suffer loss yet himself shall be saved but so as by fire and he that is able to subdue all things to himself will have all men to be saved and will in the fulness of time gather together in one all things in christ jesus who tasted death for every man and in whom god will reconcile all things to himself whether they be things in earth or things in heaven oh helen
where did you learn all this in the bible aunt
i have searched it through and found nearly thirty passages all tending to support the same theory and is that the use you make of your bible
and did you find no passages tending to prove the danger and the falsity of such a belief no i found indeed some passages that taken by themselves might seem to contradict that opinion but they will all bear a different construction to that which is commonly given and in most the only difficulty is in the word which we translate everlasting or eternal i dont know the greek but i believe it strictly means for ages and might signify either endless or longenduring
and as for the danger of the belief i would not publish it abroad if i thought any poor wretch would be likely to presume upon it to his own destruction but it is a glorious thought to cherish in ones own heart and i would not part with it for all the world can give here our conference ended for it was now high time to prepare for church
every one attended the morning service except my uncle who hardly ever goes and mr wilmot who stayed at home with him to enjoy a quiet game of cribbage
in the afternoon miss wilmot and lord lowborough likewise excused themselves from attending but mr huntingdon vouchsafed to accompany us again
whether it was to ingratiate himself with my aunt i cannot tell but if so he certainly should have behaved better
i must confess i did not like his conduct during service at all
holding his prayerbook upside down or open at any place but the right he did nothing but stare about him unless he happened to catch my aunts eye or mine and then he would drop his own on his book with a puritanical air of mock solemnity that would have been ludicrous if it had not been too provoking
once during the sermon after attentively regarding mr leighton for a few minutes he suddenly produced his gold pencilcase and snatched up a bible
perceiving that i observed the movement he whispered that he was going to make a note of the sermon but instead of that as i sat next him i could not help seeing that he was making a caricature of the preacher giving to the respectable pious elderly gentleman the air and aspect of a most absurd old hypocrite
and yet upon his return he talked to my aunt about the sermon with a degree of modest serious discrimination that tempted me to believe he had really attended to and profited by the discourse
just before dinner my uncle called me into the library for the discussion of a very important matter which was dismissed in few words
now nell said he this young huntingdon has been asking for you what must i say about it
your aunt would answer nobut what say you i say yes uncle replied i without a moments hesitation for i had thoroughly made up my mind on the subject
very good cried he
now thats a good honest answerwonderful for a girlwell ill write to your father tomorrow
hes sure to give his consent so you may look on the matter as settled
youd have done a deal better if youd taken wilmot i can tell you but that you wont believe
at your time of life its love that rules the roast at mine its solid serviceable gold
i suppose now youd never dream of looking into the state of your husbands finances or troubling your head about settlements or anything of that sort i dont think i should well be thankful then that youve wiser heads to think for you
i havent had time yet to examine thoroughly into this young rascals affairs but i see that a great part of his fathers fine property has been squandered awaybut still i think theres a pretty fair share of it left and a little careful nursing may make a handsome thing of it yet and then we must persuade your father to give you a decent fortune as he has only one besides yourself to care forand if you behave well who knows but what i may be induced to remember you in my will continued he putting his fingers to his nose with a knowing wink
thanks uncle for that and all your kindness replied i
well and i questioned this young spark on the matter of settlements continued he and he seemed disposed to be generous enough on that point i knew he would said i
but pray dont trouble your heador his or mine about that for all i have will be his and all he has will be mine and what more could either of us require and i was about to make my exit but he called me back
stop stop cried he we havent mentioned the time yet
when must it be
your aunt would put it off till the lord knows when but he is anxious to be bound as soon as may be he wont hear of waiting beyond next month and you i guess will be of the same mind so not at all uncle on the contrary i should like to wait till after christmas at least oh
pooh pooh
never tell me that talei know better cried he and he persisted in his incredulity
nevertheless it is quite true
i am in no hurry at all
how can i be when i think of the momentous change that awaits me and of all i have to leave
it is happiness enough to know that we are to be united and that he really loves me and i may love him as devotedly and think of him as often as i please
however i insisted upon consulting my aunt about the time of the wedding for i determined her counsels should not be utterly disregarded and no conclusions on that particular are come to yet
october stall is settled now
my father has given his consent and the time is fixed for christmas by a sort of compromise between the respective advocates for hurry and delay
milicent hargrave is to be one bridesmaid and annabella wilmot the othernot that i am particularly fond of the latter but she is an intimate of the family and i have not another friend
when i told milicent of my engagement she rather provoked me by her manner of taking it
after staring a moment in mute surprise she said well helen i suppose i ought to congratulate youand i am glad to see you so happy but i did not think you would take him and i cant help feeling surprised that you should like him so much why so because you are so superior to him in every way and theres something so bold and reckless about himso i dont know howbut i always feel a wish to get out of his way when i see him approach you are timid milicent but thats no fault of his and then his look continued she
people say hes handsome and of course he is but i dont like that kind of beauty and i wonder that you should why so pray well you know i think theres nothing noble or lofty in his appearance in fact you wonder that i can like any one so unlike the stilted heroes of romance
well give me my flesh and blood lover and ill leave all the sir herberts and valentines to youif you can find them i dont want them said she
ill be satisfied with flesh and blood tooonly the spirit must shine through and predominate
but dont you think mr huntingdons face is too red no cried i indignantly
it is not red at all
there is just a pleasant glow a healthy freshness in his complexionthe warm pinky tint of the whole harmonising with the deeper colour of the cheeks exactly as it ought to do
i hate a man to be red and white like a painted doll or all sickly white or smoky black or cadaverous yellow well tastes differbut i like pale or dark replied she
but to tell you the truth helen i had been deluding myself with the hope that you would one day be my sister
i expected walter would be introduced to you next season and i thought you would like him and was certain he would like you and i flattered myself i should thus have the felicity of seeing the two persons i like best in the worldexcept mammaunited in one
he maynt be exactly what you would call handsome but hes far more distinguishedlooking and nicer and better than mr huntingdonand im sure you would say so if you knew him impossible milicent
you think so because youre his sister and on that account ill forgive you but nobody else should so disparage arthur huntingdon to me with impunity miss wilmot expressed her feelings on the subject almost as openly
and so helen said she coming up to me with a smile of no amiable import you are to be mrs huntingdon i suppose yes replied i
dont you envy me oh dear no she exclaimed
i shall probably be lady lowborough some day and then you know dear i shall be in a capacity to inquire dont you envy me henceforth i shall envy no one returned i
indeed
are you so happy then said she thoughtfully and something very like a cloud of disappointment shadowed her face
and does he love youi mean does he idolise you as much as you do him she added fixing her eyes upon me with illdisguised anxiety for the reply
i dont want to be idolised i answered but i am well assured that he loves me more than anybody else in the worldas i do him exactly said she with a nod
i wish she paused
what do you wish asked i annoyed at the vindictive expression of her countenance
i wish returned she with a short laugh that all the attractive points and desirable qualifications of the two gentlemen were united in onethat lord lowborough had huntingdons handsome face and good temper and all his wit and mirth and charm or else that huntingdon had lowboroughs pedigree and title and delightful old family seat and i had him and you might have the other and welcome thank you dear annabella i am better satisfied with things as they are for my own part and for you i wish you were as well content with your intended as i am with mine said i and it was true enough for though vexed at first at her unamiable spirit her frankness touched me and the contrast between our situations was such that i could well afford to pity her and wish her well
mr huntingdons acquaintances appear to be no better pleased with our approaching union than mine
this mornings post brought him letters from several of his friends during the perusal of which at the breakfasttable he excited the attention of the company by the singular variety of his grimaces
but he crushed them all into his pocket with a private laugh and said nothing till the meal was concluded
then while the company were hanging over the fire or loitering through the room previous to settling to their various morning avocations he came and leant over the back of my chair with his face in contact with my curls and commencing with a quiet little kiss poured forth the following complaints into my ear helen you witch do you know that youve entailed upon me the curses of all my friends
i wrote to them the other day to tell them of my happy prospects and now instead of a bundle of congratulations ive got a pocketful of bitter execrations and reproaches
theres not one kind wish for me or one good word for you among them all
they say therell be no more fun now no more merry days and glorious nightsand all my faulti am the first to break up the jovial band and others in pure despair will follow my example
i was the very life and prop of the community they do me the honour to say and i have shamefully betrayed my trust you may join them again if you like said i somewhat piqued at the sorrowful tone of his discourse
i should be sorry to stand between any manor body of men and so much happiness and perhaps i can manage to do without you as well as your poor deserted friends bless you no murmured he
its all for love or the world well lost with me
let them go towhere they belong to speak politely
but if you saw how they abuse me helen you would love me all the more for having ventured so much for your sake he pulled out his crumpled letters
i thought he was going to show them to me and told him i did not wish to see them
im not going to show them to you love said he
theyre hardly fit for a ladys eyesthe most part of them
but look here
this is grimsbys scrawlonly three lines the sulky dog
he doesnt say much to be sure but his very silence implies more than all the others words and the less he says the more he thinksand this is hargraves missive
he is particularly grieved at me because forsooth he had fallen in love with you from his sisters reports and meant to have married you himself as soon as he had sown his wild oats im vastly obliged to him observed i
and so am i said he
and look at this
this is hattersleysevery page stuffed full of railing accusations bitter curses and lamentable complaints ending up with swearing that hell get married himself in revenge hell throw himself away on the first old maid that chooses to set her cap at himas if i cared what he did with himself well said i if you do give up your intimacy with these men i dont think you will have much cause to regret the loss of their society for its my belief they never did you much good maybe not but wed a merry time of it too though mingled with sorrow and pain as lowborough knows to his costha ha and while he was laughing at the recollection of lowboroughs troubles my uncle came and slapped him on the shoulder
come my lad said he
are you too busy making love to my niece to make war with the pheasantsfirst of october remember
sun shines outrain ceasedeven boarhams not afraid to venture in his waterproof boots and wilmot and i are going to beat you all
i declare we old uns are the keenest sportsmen of the lot ill show you what i can do today however said my companion
ill murder your birds by wholesale just for keeping me away from better company than either you or them and so saying he departed and i saw no more of him till dinner
it seemed a weary time i wonder what i shall do without him
it is very true that the three elder gentlemen have proved themselves much keener sportsmen than the two younger ones for both lord lowborough and arthur huntingdon have of late almost daily neglected the shooting excursions to accompany us in our various rides and rambles
but these merry times are fast drawing to a close
in less than a fortnight the party break up much to my sorrow for every day i enjoy it more and morenow that messrs boarham and wilmot have ceased to tease me and my aunt has ceased to lecture me and i have ceased to be jealous of annabellaand even to dislike herand now that mr huntingdon is become my arthur and i may enjoy his society without restraint
what shall i do without him i repeat
october thmy cup of sweets is not unmingled it is dashed with a bitterness that i cannot hide from myself disguise it as i will
i may try to persuade myself that the sweetness overpowers it i may call it a pleasant aromatic flavour but say what i will it is still there and i cannot but taste it
i cannot shut my eyes to arthurs faults and the more i love him the more they trouble me
his very heart that i trusted so is i fear less warm and generous than i thought it
at least he gave me a specimen of his character today that seemed to merit a harder name than thoughtlessness
he and lord lowborough were accompanying annabella and me in a long delightful ride he was riding by my side as usual and annabella and lord lowborough were a little before us the latter bending towards his companion as if in tender and confidential discourse
those two will get the start of us helen if we dont look sharp observed huntingdon
theyll make a match of it as sure as can be
that lowboroughs fairly besotted
but hell find himself in a fix when hes got her i doubt and shell find herself in a fix when shes got him said i if what ive heard of him is true not a bit of it
she knows what shes about but he poor fool deludes himself with the notion that shell make him a good wife and because she has amused him with some rodomontade about despising rank and wealth in matters of love and marriage he flatters himself that shes devotedly attached to him that she will not refuse him for his poverty and does not court him for his rank but loves him for himself alone but is not he courting her for her fortune no not he
that was the first attraction certainly but now he has quite lost sight of it it never enters his calculations except merely as an essential without which for the ladys own sake he could not think of marrying her
no hes fairly in love
he thought he never could be again but hes in for it once more
he was to have been married before some two or three years ago but he lost his bride by losing his fortune
he got into a bad way among us in london he had an unfortunate taste for gambling and surely the fellow was born under an unlucky star for he always lost thrice where he gained once
thats a mode of selftorment i never was much addicted to
when i spend my money i like to enjoy the full value of it i see no fun in wasting it on thieves and blacklegs and as for gaining money hitherto i have always had sufficient its time enough to be clutching for more i think when you begin to see the end of what you have
but i have sometimes frequented the gaminghouses just to watch the ongoings of those mad votaries of chancea very interesting study i assure you helen and sometimes very diverting ive had many a laugh at the boobies and bedlamites
lowborough was quite infatuatednot willingly but of necessityhe was always resolving to give it up and always breaking his resolutions
every venture was the just once more if he gained a little he hoped to gain a little more next time and if he lost it would not do to leave off at that juncture he must go on till he had retrieved that last misfortune at least bad luck could not last for ever and every lucky hit was looked upon as the dawn of better times till experience proved the contrary
at length he grew desperate and we were daily on the lookout for a case of felodeseno great matter some of us whispered as his existence had ceased to be an acquisition to our club
at last however he came to a check
he made a large stake which he determined should be the last whether he lost or won
he had often so determined before to be sure and as often broken his determination and so it was this time
he lost and while his antagonist smilingly swept away the stakes he turned chalky white drew back in silence and wiped his forehead
i was present at the time and while he stood with folded arms and eyes fixed on the ground i knew well enough what was passing in his mind
is it to be the last lowborough said i stepping up to him
the last but one he answered with a grim smile and then rushing back to the table he struck his hand upon it and raising his voice high above all the confusion of jingling coins and muttered oaths and curses in the room he swore a deep and solemn oath that come what would this trial should be the last and imprecated unspeakable curses on his head if ever he should shuffle a card or rattle a dicebox again
he then doubled his former stake and challenged any one present to play against him
grimsby instantly presented himself
lowborough glared fiercely at him for grimsby was almost as celebrated for his luck as he was for his illfortune
however they fell to work
but grimsby had much skill and little scruple and whether he took advantage of the others trembling blinded eagerness to deal unfairly by him i cannot undertake to say but lowborough lost again and fell dead sick
youd better try once more said grimsby leaning across the table
and then he winked at me
ive nothing to try with said the poor devil with a ghastly smile
oh huntingdon will lend you what you want said the other
no you heard my oath answered lowborough turning away in quiet despair
and i took him by the arm and led him out
is it to be the last lowborough i asked when i got him into the street
the last he answered somewhat against my expectation
and i took him homethat is to our clubfor he was as submissive as a childand plied him with brandyandwater till he began to look rather brighterrather more alive at least
huntingdon im ruined said he taking the third glass from my handhe had drunk the others in dead silence
not you said i
youll find a man can live without his money as merrily as a tortoise without its head or a wasp without its body but im in debt said hedeep in debt
and i can never never get out of it well what of that
many a better man than you has lived and died in debt and they cant put you in prison you know because youre a peer and i handed him his fourth tumbler
but i hate to be in debt he shouted
i wasnt born for it and i cannot bear it what cant be cured must be endured said i beginning to mix the fifth
and then ive lost my caroline and he began to snivel then for the brandy had softened his heart
no matter i answered there are more carolines in the world than one theres only one for me he replied with a dolorous sigh
and if there were fifty more whos to get them i wonder without money oh somebody will take you for your title and then youve your family estate yet thats entailed you know i wish to god i could sell it to pay my debts he muttered
and then said grimsby who had just come in you can try again you know
i would have more than one chance if i were you
id never stop here i wont i tell you shouted he
and he started up and left the roomwalking rather unsteadily for the liquor had got into his head
he was not so much used to it then but after that he took to it kindly to solace his cares
he kept his oath about gambling not a little to the surprise of us all though grimsby did his utmost to tempt him to break it but now he had got hold of another habit that bothered him nearly as much for he soon discovered that the demon of drink was as black as the demon of play and nearly as hard to get rid ofespecially as his kind friends did all they could to second the promptings of his own insatiable cravings then they were demons themselves cried i unable to contain my indignation
and you mr huntingdon it seems were the first to tempt him well what could we do replied he deprecatinglywe meant it in kindnesswe couldnt bear to see the poor fellow so miserableand besides he was such a damper upon us sitting there silent and glum when he was under the threefold influenceof the loss of his sweetheart the loss of his fortune and the reaction of the lost nights debauch whereas when he had something in him if he was not merry himself he was an unfailing source of merriment to us
even grimsby could chuckle over his odd sayings they delighted him far more than my merry jests or hattersleys riotous mirth
but one evening when we were sitting over our wine after one of our club dinners and all had been hearty togetherlowborough giving us mad toasts and hearing our wild songs and bearing a hand in the applause if he did not help us to sing them himselfhe suddenly relapsed into silence sinking his head on his hand and never lifting his glass to his lipsbut this was nothing new so we let him alone and went on with our jollification till suddenly raising his head he interrupted us in the middle of a roar of laughter by exclaiming gentlemen where is all this to endwill you just tell me that nowwhere is it all to end he rose
a speech a speech shouted we
hear hear
lowboroughs going to give us a speech he waited calmly till the thunders of applause and jingling of glasses had ceased and then proceededits only this gentlementhat i think wed better go no further
wed better stop while we can just so cried hattersley stop poor sinner stop and think before you farther go no longer sport upon the brink of everlasting woe exactly replied his lordship with the utmost gravity
and if you choose to visit the bottomless pit i wont go with youwe must part company for i swear ill not move another step towards itwhats this he said taking up his glass of wine
taste it suggested i
this is hell broth he exclaimed
i renounce it for ever and he threw it out into the middle of the table
fill again said i handing him the bottleand let us drink to your renunciation its rank poison said he grasping the bottle by the neck and i forswear it
ive given up gambling and ill give up this too he was on the point of deliberately pouring the whole contents of the bottle on to the table but hargrave wrested it from him
on you be the curse then said he
and backing from the room he shouted farewell ye tempters and vanished amid shouts of laughter and applause
we expected him back among us the next day but to our surprise the place remained vacant we saw nothing of him for a whole week and we really began to think he was going to keep his word
at last one evening when we were most of us assembled together again he entered silent and grim as a ghost and would have quietly slipped into his usual seat at my elbow but we all rose to welcome him and several voices were raised to ask what he would have and several hands were busy with bottle and glass to serve him but i knew a smoking tumbler of brandyandwater would comfort him best and had nearly prepared it when he peevishly pushed it away saying do let me alone huntingdon
do be quiet all of you
im not come to join you im only come to be with you awhile because i cant bear my own thoughts and he folded his arms and leant back in his chair so we let him be
but i left the glass by him and after awhile grimsby directed my attention towards it by a significant wink and on turning my head i saw it was drained to the bottom
he made me a sign to replenish and quietly pushed up the bottle
i willingly complied but lowborough detected the pantomime and nettled at the intelligent grins that were passing between us snatched the glass from my hand dashed the contents of it in grimsbys face threw the empty tumbler at me and then bolted from the room i hope he broke your head said i
no love replied he laughing immoderately at the recollection of the whole affair he would have done soand perhaps spoilt my face too but providentially this forest of curls taking off his hat and showing his luxuriant chestnut locks saved my skull and prevented the glass from breaking till it reached the table after that he continued lowborough kept aloof from us a week or two longer
i used to meet him occasionally in the town and then as i was too goodnatured to resent his unmannerly conduct and he bore no malice against mehe was never unwilling to talk to me on the contrary he would cling to me and follow me anywhere but to the club and the gaminghouses and suchlike dangerous places of resorthe was so weary of his own moping melancholy mind
at last i got him to come in with me to the club on condition that i would not tempt him to drink and for some time he continued to look in upon us pretty regularly of an eveningstill abstaining with wonderful perseverance from the rank poison he had so bravely forsworn
but some of our members protested against this conduct
they did not like to have him sitting there like a skeleton at a feast instead of contributing his quota to the general amusement casting a cloud over all and watching with greedy eyes every drop they carried to their lipsthey vowed it was not fair and some of them maintained that he should either be compelled to do as others did or expelled from the society and swore that next time he showed himself they would tell him as much and if he did not take the warning proceed to active measures
however i befriended him on this occasion and recommended them to let him be for a while intimating that with a little patience on our parts he would soon come round again
but to be sure it was rather provoking for though he refused to drink like an honest christian it was well known to me that he kept a private bottle of laudanum about him which he was continually soaking ator rather holding off and on with abstaining one day and exceeding the nextjust like the spirits
one night however during one of our orgiesone of our high festivals i meanhe glided in like the ghost in macbeth and seated himself as usual a little back from the table in the chair we always placed for the spectre whether it chose to fill it or not
i saw by his face that he was suffering from the effects of an overdose of his insidious comforter but nobody spoke to him and he spoke to nobody
a few sidelong glances and a whispered observation that the ghost was come was all the notice he drew by his appearance and we went on with our merry carousals as before till he startled us all by suddenly drawing in his chair and leaning forward with his elbows on the table and exclaiming with portentous solemnity well
it puzzles me what you can find to be so merry about
what you see in life i dont knowi see only the blackness of darkness and a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation all the company simultaneously pushed up their glasses to him and i set them before him in a semicircle and tenderly patting him on the back bid him drink and he would soon see as bright a prospect as any of us but he pushed them back muttering take them away
i wont taste it i tell you
i wonti wont so i handed them down again to the owners but i saw that he followed them with a glare of hungry regret as they departed
then he clasped his hands before his eyes to shut out the sight and two minutes after lifted his head again and said in a hoarse but vehement whisper and yet i must
huntingdon get me a glass take the bottle man said i thrusting the brandybottle into his handbut stop im telling too much muttered the narrator startled at the look i turned upon him
but no matter he recklessly added and thus continued his relation in his desperate eagerness he seized the bottle and sucked away till he suddenly dropped from his chair disappearing under the table amid a tempest of applause
the consequence of this imprudence was something like an apoplectic fit followed by a rather severe brain fever and what did you think of yourself sir said i quickly
of course i was very penitent he replied
i went to see him once or twicenay twice or thriceor byr lady some four timesand when he got better i tenderly brought him back to the fold what do you mean i mean i restored him to the bosom of the club and compassionating the feebleness of his health and extreme lowness of his spirits i recommended him to take a little wine for his stomachs sake and when he was sufficiently reestablished to embrace the mediavia nijamaisnitoujours plannot to kill himself like a fool and not to abstain like a ninnyin a word to enjoy himself like a rational creature and do as i did for dont think helen that im a tippler im nothing at all of the kind and never was and never shall be
i value my comfort far too much
i see that a man cannot give himself up to drinking without being miserable onehalf his days and mad the other besides i like to enjoy my life at all sides and ends which cannot be done by one that suffers himself to be the slave of a single propensityand moreover drinking spoils ones good looks he concluded with a most conceited smile that ought to have provoked me more than it did
and did lord lowborough profit by your advice i asked
why yes in a manner
for a while he managed very well indeed he was a model of moderation and prudencesomething too much so for the tastes of our wild community but somehow lowborough had not the gift of moderation if he stumbled a little to one side he must go down before he could right himself if he overshot the mark one night the effects of it rendered him so miserable the next day that he must repeat the offence to mend it and so on from day to day till his clamorous conscience brought him to a stand
and then in his sober moments he so bothered his friends with his remorse and his terrors and woes that they were obliged in selfdefence to get him to drown his sorrows in wine or any more potent beverage that came to hand and when his first scruples of conscience were overcome he would need no more persuading he would often grow desperate and be as great a blackguard as any of them could desirebut only to lament his own unutterable wickedness and degradation the more when the fit was over
at last one day when he and i were alone together after pondering awhile in one of his gloomy abstracted moods with his arms folded and his head sunk on his breast he suddenly woke up and vehemently grasping my arm said huntingdon this wont do
im resolved to have done with it what are you going to shoot yourself said i
no im going to reform oh thats nothing new
youve been going to reform these twelve months and more yes but you wouldnt let me and i was such a fool i couldnt live without you
but now i see what it is that keeps me back and whats wanted to save me and id compass sea and land to get itonly im afraid theres no chance and he sighed as if his heart would break
what is it lowborough said i thinking he was fairly cracked at last
a wife he answered for i cant live alone because my own mind distracts me and i cant live with you because you take the devils part against me whoi yesall of you doand you more than any of them you know
but if i could get a wife with fortune enough to pay off my debts and set me straight in the world to be sure said i
and sweetness and goodness enough he continued to make home tolerable and to reconcile me to myself i think i should do yet
i shall never be in love again thats certain but perhaps that would be no great matter it would enable me to choose with my eyes openand i should make a good husband in spite of it but could any one be in love with methats the question
with your good looks and powers of fascination he was pleased to say i might hope but as it is huntingdon do you think anybody would take meruined and wretched as i am yes certainly who why any neglected old maid fast sinking in despair would be delighted to no no said heit must be somebody that i can love why you just said you never could be in love again well love is not the wordbut somebody that i can like
ill search all england through at all events he cried with a sudden burst of hope or desperation
succeed or fail it will be better than rushing headlong to destruction at that dd club so farewell to it and you
whenever i meet you on honest ground or under a christian roof i shall be glad to see you but never more shall you entice me to that devils den this was shameful language but i shook hands with him and we parted
he kept his word and from that time forward he has been a pattern of propriety as far as i can tell but till lately i have not had very much to do with him
he occasionally sought my company but as frequently shrunk from it fearing lest i should wile him back to destruction and i found his not very entertaining especially as he sometimes attempted to awaken my conscience and draw me from the perdition he considered himself to have escaped but when i did happen to meet him i seldom failed to ask after the progress of his matrimonial efforts and researches and in general he could give me but a poor account
the mothers were repelled by his empty coffers and his reputation for gambling and the daughters by his cloudy brow and melancholy temperbesides he didnt understand them he wanted the spirit and assurance to carry his point
i left him at it when i went to the continent and on my return at the years end i found him still a disconsolate bachelorthough certainly looking somewhat less like an unblest exile from the tomb than before
the young ladies had ceased to be afraid of him and were beginning to think him quite interesting but the mammas were still unrelenting
it was about this time helen that my good angel brought me into conjunction with you and then i had eyes and ears for nobody else
but meantime lowborough became acquainted with our charming friend miss wilmotthrough the intervention of his good angel no doubt he would tell you though he did not dare to fix his hopes on one so courted and admired till after they were brought into closer contact here at staningley and she in the absence of her other admirers indubitably courted his notice and held out every encouragement to his timid advances
then indeed he began to hope for a dawn of brighter days and if for a while i darkened his prospects by standing between him and his sunand so nearly plunged him again into the abyss of despairit only intensified his ardour and strengthened his hopes when i chose to abandon the field in the pursuit of a brighter treasure
in a word as i told you he is fairly besotted
at first he could dimly perceive her faults and they gave him considerable uneasiness but now his passion and her art together have blinded him to everything but her perfections and his amazing good fortune
last night he came to me brimful of his newfound felicity huntingdon i am not a castaway said he seizing my hand and squeezing it like a vice
there is happiness in store for me yeteven in this lifeshe loves me indeed said i
has she told you so no but i can no longer doubt it
do you not see how pointedly kind and affectionate she is
and she knows the utmost extent of my poverty and cares nothing about it
she knows all the folly and all the wickedness of my former life and is not afraid to trust meand my rank and title are no allurements to her for them she utterly disregards
she is the most generous highminded being that can be conceived of
she will save me body and soul from destruction
already she has ennobled me in my own estimation and made me three times better wiser greater than i was
oh
if i had but known her before how much degradation and misery i should have been spared
but what have i done to deserve so magnificent a creature and the cream of the jest continued mr huntingdon laughing is that the artful minx loves nothing about him but his title and pedigree and that delightful old family seat how do you know said i
she told me so herself she said as for the man himself i thoroughly despise him but then i suppose it is time to be making my choice and if i waited for some one capable of eliciting my esteem and affection i should have to pass my life in single blessedness for i detest you all ha ha
i suspect she was wrong there but however it is evident she has no love for him poor fellow then you ought to tell him so what
and spoil all her plans and prospects poor girl
no no that would be a breach of confidence wouldnt it helen
ha ha
besides it would break his heart and he laughed again
well mr huntingdon i dont know what you see so amazingly diverting in the matter i see nothing to laugh at im laughing at you just now love said he redoubling his machinations
and leaving him to enjoy his merriment alone i touched ruby with the whip and cantered on to rejoin our companions for we had been walking our horses all this time and were consequently a long way behind
arthur was soon at my side again but not disposed to talk to him i broke into a gallop
he did the same and we did not slacken our pace till we came up with miss wilmot and lord lowborough which was within half a mile of the parkgates
i avoided all further conversation with him till we came to the end of our ride when i meant to jump off my horse and vanish into the house before he could offer his assistance but while i was disengaging my habit from the crutch he lifted me off and held me by both hands asserting that he would not let me go till i had forgiven him
i have nothing to forgive said i
you have not injured me no darlinggod forbid that i should
but you are angry because it was to me that annabella confessed her lack of esteem for her lover no arthur it is not that that displeases me it is the whole system of your conduct towards your friend and if you wish me to forget it go now and tell him what sort of a woman it is that he adores so madly and on whom he has hung his hopes of future happiness i tell you helen it would break his heartit would be the death of himbesides being a scandalous trick to poor annabella
there is no help for him now he is past praying for
besides she may keep up the deception to the end of the chapter and then he will be just as happy in the illusion as if it were reality or perhaps he will only discover his mistake when he has ceased to love her and if not it is much better that the truth should dawn gradually upon him
so now my angel i hope i have made out a clear case and fully convinced you that i cannot make the atonement you require
what other requisition have you to make
speak and i will gladly obey i have none but this said i as gravely as before that in future you will never make a jest of the sufferings of others and always use your influence with your friends for their own advantage against their evil propensities instead of seconding their evil propensities against themselves i will do my utmost said he to remember and perform the injunctions of my angel monitress and after kissing both my gloved hands he let me go
when i entered my room i was surprised to see annabella wilmot standing before my toilettable composedly surveying her features in the glass with one hand flirting her goldmounted whip and the other holding up her long habit
she certainly is a magnificent creature thought i as i beheld that tall finely developed figure and the reflection of the handsome face in the mirror before me with the glossy dark hair slightly and not ungracefully disordered by the breezy ride the rich brown complexion glowing with exercise and the black eyes sparkling with unwonted brilliance
on perceiving me she turned round exclaiming with a laugh that savoured more of malice than of mirth why helen
what have you been doing so long
i came to tell you my good fortune she continued regardless of rachels presence
lord lowborough has proposed and i have been graciously pleased to accept him
dont you envy me dear no love said ior him either i mentally added
and do you like him annabella like him
yes to be sureover head and ears in love well i hope youll make him a good wife thank you my dear
and what besides do you hope i hope you will both love each other and both be happy thanks and i hope you will make a very good wife to mr huntingdon said she with a queenly bow and retired
oh miss
how could you say so to her cried rachel
say what replied i
why that you hoped she would make him a good wife
i never heard such a thing because i do hope it or rather i wish it shes almost past hope well said she im sure i hope hell make her a good husband
they tell queer things about him downstairs
they were saying i know rachel
ive heard all about him but hes reformed now
and they have no business to tell tales about their masters no mumor else they have said some things about mr huntingdon too i wont hear them rachel they tell lies yes mum said she quietly as she went on arranging my hair
do you believe them rachel i asked after a short pause
no miss not all
you know when a lot of servants gets together they like to talk about their betters and some for a bit of swagger likes to make it appear as though they knew more than they do and to throw out hints and things just to astonish the others
but i think if i was you miss helen id look very well before i leaped
i do believe a young lady cant be too careful who she marries of course not said i but be quick will you rachel
i want to be dressed and indeed i was anxious to be rid of the good woman for i was in such a melancholy frame i could hardly keep the tears out of my eyes while she dressed me
it was not for lord lowboroughit was not for annabellait was not for myselfit was for arthur huntingdon that they rose
ththey are gone and he is gone
we are to be parted for more than two months above ten weeks
a long long time to live and not to see him
but he has promised to write often and made me promise to write still oftener because he will be busy settling his affairs and i shall have nothing better to do
well i think i shall always have plenty to say
but oh
for the time when we shall be always together and can exchange our thoughts without the intervention of these cold gobetweens pen ink and paper
ndi have had several letters from arthur already
they are not long but passing sweet and just like himself full of ardent affection and playful lively humour but there is always a but in this imperfect world and i do wish he would sometimes be serious
i cannot get him to write or speak in real solid earnest
i dont much mind it now but if it be always so what shall i do with the serious part of myself
feb early this morning arthur mounted his hunter and set off in high glee to meet the hounds
he will be away all day and so i will amuse myself with my neglected diary if i can give that name to such an irregular composition
it is exactly four months since i opened it last
i am married now and settled down as mrs huntingdon of grassdale manor
i have had eight weeks experience of matrimony
and do i regret the step i have taken
no though i must confess in my secret heart that arthur is not what i thought him at first and if i had known him in the beginning as thoroughly as i do now i probably never should have loved him and if i loved him first and then made the discovery i fear i should have thought it my duty not to have married him
to be sure i might have known him for every one was willing enough to tell me about him and he himself was no accomplished hypocrite but i was wilfully blind and now instead of regretting that i did not discern his full character before i was indissolubly bound to him i am glad for it has saved me a great deal of battling with my conscience and a great deal of consequent trouble and pain and whatever i ought to have done my duty now is plainly to love him and to cleave to him and this just tallies with my inclination
he is very fond of me almost too fond
i could do with less caressing and more rationality
i should like to be less of a pet and more of a friend if i might choose but i wont complain of that i am only afraid his affection loses in depth where it gains in ardour
i sometimes liken it to a fire of dry twigs and branches compared with one of solid coal very bright and hot but if it should burn itself out and leave nothing but ashes behind what shall i do
but it wont it shant i am determined and surely i have power to keep it alive
so let me dismiss that thought at once
but arthur is selfish i am constrained to acknowledge that and indeed the admission gives me less pain than might be expected for since i love him so much i can easily forgive him for loving himself he likes to be pleased and it is my delight to please him and when i regret this tendency of his it is for his own sake not for mine
the first instance he gave was on the occasion of our bridal tour
he wanted to hurry it over for all the continental scenes were already familiar to him many had lost their interest in his eyes and others had never had anything to lose
the consequence was that after a flying transit through part of france and part of italy i came back nearly as ignorant as i went having made no acquaintance with persons and manners and very little with things my head swarming with a motley confusion of objects and scenes some it is true leaving a deeper and more pleasing impression than others but these embittered by the recollection that my emotions had not been shared by my companion but that on the contrary when i had expressed a particular interest in anything that i saw or desired to see it had been displeasing to him inasmuch as it proved that i could take delight in anything disconnected with himself
illustration as for paris we only just touched at that and he would not give me time to see onetenth of the beauties and interesting objects of rome
he wanted to get me home he said to have me all to himself and to see me safely installed as the mistress of grassdale manor just as singleminded as nave and piquante as i was and as if i had been some frail butterfly he expressed himself fearful of rubbing the silver off my wings by bringing me into contact with society especially that of paris and rome and moreover he did not scruple to tell me that there were ladies in both places that would tear his eyes out if they happened to meet him with me
of course i was vexed at all this but still it was less the disappointment to myself that annoyed me than the disappointment in him and the trouble i was at to frame excuses to my friends for having seen and observed so little without imputing one particle of blame to my companion
but when we got hometo my new delightful homei was so happy and he was so kind that i freely forgave him all and i was beginning to think my lot too happy and my husband actually too good for me if not too good for this world when on the second sunday after our arrival he shocked and horrified me by another instance of his unreasonable exaction
we were walking home from the morning service for it was a fine frosty day and as we are so near the church i had requested the carriage should not be used
helen said he with unusual gravity i am not quite satisfied with you i desired to know what was wrong
but will you promise to reform if i tell you yes if i can and without offending a higher authority ah
there it is you see you dont love me with all your heart i dont understand you arthur at least i hope i dont pray tell me what i have done or said amiss it is nothing you have done or said it is something that you are you are too religious
now i like a woman to be religious and i think your piety one of your greatest charms but then like all other good things it may be carried too far
to my thinking a womans religion ought not to lessen her devotion to her earthly lord
she should have enough to purify and etherealise her soul but not enough to refine away her heart and raise her above all human sympathies and am i above all human sympathies said i
no darling but you are making more progress towards that saintly condition than i like for all these two hours i have been thinking of you and wanting to catch your eye and you were so absorbed in your devotions that you had not even a glance to spare for mei declare it is enough to make one jealous of ones makerwhich is very wrong you know so dont excite such wicked passions again for my souls sake i will give my whole heart and soul to my maker if i can i answered and not one atom more of it to you than he allows
what are you sir that you should set yourself up as a god and presume to dispute possession of my heart with him to whom i owe all i have and all i am every blessing i ever did or ever can enjoyand yourself among the restif you are a blessing which i am half inclined to doubt dont be so hard upon me helen and dont pinch my arm so you are squeezing your fingers into the bone arthur continued i relaxing my hold of his arm you dont love me half as much as i do you and yet if you loved me far less than you do i would not complain provided you loved your maker more
i should rejoice to see you at any time so deeply absorbed in your devotions that you had not a single thought to spare for me
but indeed i should lose nothing by the change for the more you loved your god the more deep and pure and true would be your love to me at this he only laughed and kissed my hand calling me a sweet enthusiast
then taking off his hat he added but look here helenwhat can a man do with such a head as this the head looked right enough but when he placed my hand on the top of it it sunk in a bed of curls rather alarmingly low especially in the middle
you see i was not made to be a saint said he laughing if god meant me to be religious why didnt he give me a proper organ of veneration you are like the servant i replied who instead of employing his one talent in his masters service restored it to him unimproved alleging as an excuse that he knew him to be a hard man reaping where he had not sown and gathering where he had not strawed of him to whom less is given less will be required but our utmost exertions are required of us all
you are not without the capacity of veneration and faith and hope and conscience and reason and every other requisite to a christians character if you choose to employ them but all our talents increase in the using and every faculty both good and bad strengthens by exercise therefore if you choose to use the bad or those which tend to evil till they become your masters and neglect the good till they dwindle away you have only yourself to blame
but you have talents arthurnatural endowments both of heart and mind and temper such as many a better christian would be glad to possess if you would only employ them in gods service
i should never expect to see you a devotee but it is quite possible to be a good christian without ceasing to be a happy merryhearted man you speak like an oracle helen and all you say is indisputably true but listen here i am hungry and i see before me a good substantial dinner i am told that if i abstain from this today i shall have a sumptuous feast tomorrow consisting of all manner of dainties and delicacies
now in the first place i should be loth to wait till tomorrow when i have the means of appeasing my hunger already before me in the second place the solid viands of today are more to my taste than the dainties that are promised me in the third place i dont see tomorrows banquet and how can i tell that it is not all a fable got up by the greasyfaced fellow that is advising me to abstain in order that he may have all the good victuals to himself
in the fourth place this table must be spread for somebody and as solomon says who can eat or who else can hasten hereunto more than i and finally with your leave ill sit down and satisfy my cravings of today and leave tomorrow to shift for itselfwho knows but what i may secure both this and that but you are not required to abstain from the substantial dinner of today you are only advised to partake of these coarser viands in such moderation as not to incapacitate you from enjoying the choicer banquet of tomorrow
if regardless of that counsel you choose to make a beast of yourself now and overeat and overdrink yourself till you turn the good victuals into poison who is to blame if hereafter while you are suffering the torments of yesterdays gluttony and drunkenness you see more temperate men sitting down to enjoy themselves at that splendid entertainment which you are unable to taste most true my patron saint but again our friend solomon says there is nothing better for a man than to eat and to drink and to be merry and again returned i he says rejoice o young man in thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things god will bring thee into judgment well but helen im sure ive been very good these last few weeks
what have you seen amiss in me and what would you have me to do nothing more than you do arthur your actions are all right so far but i would have your thoughts changed i would have you to fortify yourself against temptation and not to call evil good and good evil i should wish you to think more deeply to look further and aim higher than you do march tharthur is getting tirednot of me i trust but of the idle quiet life he leadsand no wonder for he has so few sources of amusement he never reads anything but newspapers and sporting magazines and when he sees me occupied with a book he wont let me rest till i close it
in fine weather he generally manages to get through the time pretty well but on rainy days of which we have had a good many of late it is quite painful to witness his ennui
i do all i can to amuse him but it is impossible to get him to feel interested in what i most like to talk about while on the other hand he likes to talk about things that cannot interest meor even that annoy meand these please himthe most of all for his favourite amusement is to sit or loll beside me on the sofa and tell me stories of his former amours always turning upon the ruin of some confiding girl or the cozening of some unsuspecting husband and when i express my horror and indignation he lays it all to the charge of jealousy and laughs till the tears run down his cheeks
i used to fly into passions or melt into tears at first but seeing that his delight increased in proportion to my anger and agitation i have since endeavoured to suppress my feelings and receive his revelations in the silence of calm contempt but still he reads the inward struggle in my face and misconstrues my bitterness of soul for his unworthiness into the pangs of wounded jealousy and when he has sufficiently diverted himself with that or fears my displeasure will become too serious for his comfort he tries to kiss and soothe me into smiles againnever were his caresses so little welcome as then
this is double selfishness displayed to me and to the victims of his former love
there are times when with a momentary panga flash of wild dismay i ask myself helen what have you done but i rebuke the inward questioner and repel the obtrusive thoughts that crowd upon me for were he ten times as sensual and impenetrable to good and lofty thoughts i well know i have no right to complain
and i dont and wont complain
i do and will love him still and i do not and will not regret that i have linked my fate with his
april thwe have had a downright quarrel
the particulars are as follows arthur had told me at different intervals the whole story of his intrigue with lady f which i would not believe before
it was some consolation however to find that in this instance the lady had been more to blame than he for he was very young at the time and she had decidedly made the first advances if what he said was true
i hated her for it for it seemed as if she had chiefly contributed to his corruption and when he was beginning to talk about her the other day i begged he would not mention her for i detested the very sound of her name
not because you loved her arthur mind but because she injured you and deceived her husband and was altogether a very abominable woman whom you ought to be ashamed to mention but he defended her by saying that she had a doting old husband whom it was impossible to love
then why did she marry him said i
for his money was the reply
then that was another crime and her solemn promise to love and honour him was another that only increased the enormity of the last you are too severe upon the poor lady laughed he
but never mind helen i dont care for her now and i never loved any of them half as much as i do you so you neednt fear to be forsaken like them if you had told me these things before arthur i never should have given you the chance wouldnt you my darling most certainly not he laughed incredulously
i wish i could convince you of it now cried i starting up from beside him and for the first time in my life and i hope the last i wished i had not married him
helen said he more gravely do you know that if i believed you now i should be very angry
but thank heaven i dont
though you stand there with your white face and flashing eyes looking at me like a very tigress i know the heart within you perhaps a trifle better than you know it yourself without another word i left the room and locked myself up in my own chamber
in about half an hour he came to the door and first he tried the handle then he knocked
wont you let me in helen said he
no you have displeased me i replied and i dont want to see your face or hear your voice again till the morning he paused a moment as if dumfounded or uncertain how to answer such a speech and then turned and walked away
this was only an hour after dinner i knew he would find it very dull to sit alone all the evening and this considerably softened my resentment though it did not make me relent
i was determined to show him that my heart was not his slave and i could live without him if i chose and i sat down and wrote a long letter to my aunt of course telling her nothing of all this
soon after ten oclock i heard him come up again but he passed my door and went straight to his own dressingroom where he shut himself in for the night
i was rather anxious to see how he would meet me in the morning and not a little disappointed to behold him enter the breakfastroom with a careless smile
are you cross still helen said he approaching as if to salute me
i coldly turned to the table and began to pour out the coffee observing that he was rather late
he uttered a low whistle and sauntered away to the window where he stood for some minutes looking out upon the pleasing prospect of sullen grey clouds streaming rain soaking lawn and dripping leafless trees and muttering execrations on the weather and then sat down to breakfast
while taking his coffee he muttered it was dd cold you should not have left it so long said i
he made no answer and the meal was concluded in silence
it was a relief to both when the letterbag was brought in
it contained upon examination a newspaper and one or two letters for him and a couple of letters for me which he tossed across the table without a remark
one was from my brother the other from milicent hargrave who is now in london with her mother
his i think were business letters and apparently not much to his mind for he crushed them into his pocket with some muttered expletives that i should have reproved him for at any other time
the paper he set before him and pretended to be deeply absorbed in its contents during the remainder of breakfast and a considerable time after
the reading and answering of my letters and the direction of household concerns afforded me ample employment for the morning after lunch i got my drawing and from dinner till bedtime i read
meanwhile poor arthur was sadly at a loss for something to amuse him or to occupy his time
he wanted to appear as busy and as unconcerned as i did
had the weather at all permitted he would doubtless have ordered his horse and set off to some distant region no matter where immediately after breakfast and not returned till night had there been a lady anywhere within reach of any age between fifteen and fortyfive he would have sought revenge and found employment in getting up or trying to get up a desperate flirtation with her but being to my private satisfaction entirely cut off from both these sources of diversion his sufferings were truly deplorable
when he had done yawning over his paper and scribbling short answers to his shorter letters he spent the remainder of the morning and the whole of the afternoon in fidgeting about from room to room watching the clouds cursing the rain alternately petting and teasing and abusing his dogs sometimes lounging on the sofa with a book that he could not force himself to read and very often fixedly gazing at me when he thought i did not perceive it with the vain hope of detecting some traces of tears or some tokens of remorseful anguish in my face
but i managed to preserve an undisturbed though grave serenity throughout the day
i was not really angry i felt for him all the time and longed to be reconciled but i determined he should make the first advances or at least show some signs of an humble and contrite spirit first for if i began it would only minister to his selfconceit increase his arrogance and quite destroy the lesson i wanted to give him
he made a long stay in the diningroom after dinner and i fear took an unusual quantity of wine but not enough to loosen his tongue for when he came in and found me quietly occupied with my book too busy to lift my head on his entrance he merely murmured an expression of suppressed disapprobation and shutting the door with a bang went and stretched himself at full length on the sofa and composed himself to sleep
but his favourite cocker dash that had been lying at my feet took the liberty of jumping upon him and beginning to lick his face
he struck it off with a smart blow and the poor dog squeaked and ran cowering back to me
when he woke up about half an hour after he called it to him again but dash only looked sheepish and wagged the tip of his tail
he called again more sharply but dash only clung the closer to me and licked my hand as if imploring protection
enraged at this his master snatched up a heavy book and hurled it at his head
the poor dog set up a piteous outcry and ran to the door
i let him out and then quietly took up the book
give that book to me said arthur in no very courteous tone
i gave it to him
why did you let the dog out he asked you knew i wanted him by what token i replied by your throwing the book at him
but perhaps it was intended for me no but i see youve got a taste of it said he looking at my hand that had also been struck and was rather severely grazed
i returned to my reading and he endeavoured to occupy himself in the same manner but in a little while after several portentous yawns he pronounced his book to be cursed trash and threw it on the table
then followed eight or ten minutes of silence during the greater part of which i believe he was staring at me
at last his patience was tired out
what is that book helen he exclaimed
i told him
is it interesting yes very i went on reading or pretending to read at leasti cannot say there was much communication between my eyes and my brain for while the former ran over the pages the latter was earnestly wondering when arthur would speak next and what he would say and what i should answer
but he did not speak again till i rose to make the tea and then it was only to say he should not take any
he continued lounging on the sofa and alternately closing his eyes and looking at his watch and at me till bedtime when i rose and took my candle and retired
helen cried he the moment i had left the room
i turned back and stood awaiting his commands
what do you want arthur i said at length
nothing replied he
go i went but hearing him mutter something as i was closing the door i turned again
it sounded very like confounded slut but i was quite willing it should be something else
were you speaking arthur i asked
no was the answer and i shut the door and departed
i saw nothing more of him till the following morning at breakfast when he came down a full hour after the usual time
youre very late was my mornings salutation
you neednt have waited for me was his and he walked up to the window again
it was just such weather as yesterday
oh this confounded rain he muttered
but after studiously regarding it for a minute or two a bright idea seemed to strike him for he suddenly exclaimed but i know what ill do and then returned and took his seat at the table
the letterbag was already there waiting to be opened
he unlocked it and examined the contents but said nothing about them
is there anything for me i asked
no he opened the newspaper and began to read
youd better take your coffee suggested i it will be cold again you may go said he if youve done i dont want you i rose and withdrew to the next room wondering if we were to have another such miserable day as yesterday and wishing intensely for an end of these mutually inflicted torments
shortly after i heard him ring the bell and give some orders about his wardrobe that sounded as if he meditated a long journey
he then sent for the coachman and i heard something about the carriage and the horses and london and seven oclock tomorrow morning that startled and disturbed me not a little
i must not let him go to london whatever comes of it said i to myself he will run into all kinds of mischief and i shall be the cause of it
but the question is how am i to alter his purpose
well i will wait awhile and see if he mentions it i waited most anxiously from hour to hour but not a word was spoken on that or any other subject to me
he whistled and talked to his dogs and wandered from room to room much the same as on the previous day
at last i began to think i must introduce the subject myself and was pondering how to bring it about when john unwittingly came to my relief with the following message from the coachman please sir richard says one of the horses has got a very bad cold and he thinks sir if you could make it convenient to go the day after tomorrow instead of tomorrow he could physic it today so as confound his impudence interjected the master
please sir he says it would be a deal better if you could persisted john for he hopes therell be a change in the weather shortly and he says its not likely when a horse is so bad with a cold and physicked and all devil take the horse cried the gentleman
well tell him ill think about it he added after a moments reflection
he cast a searching glance at me as the servant withdrew expecting to see some token of deep astonishment and alarm but being previously prepared i preserved an aspect of stoical indifference
his countenance fell as he met my steady gaze and he turned away in very obvious disappointment and walked up to the fireplace where he stood in an attitude of undisguised dejection leaning against the chimneypiece with his forehead sunk upon his arm
where do you want to go arthur said i
to london replied he gravely
what for i asked
because i cannot be happy here why not because my wife doesnt love me she would love you with all her heart if you deserved it what must i do to deserve it this seemed humble and earnest enough and i was so much affected between sorrow and joy that i was obliged to pause a few seconds before i could steady my voice to reply
if she gives you her heart said i you must take it thankfully and use it well and not pull it in pieces and laugh in her face because she cannot snatch it away he now turned round and stood facing me with his back to the fire
come then helen are you going to be a good girl said he
this sounded rather too arrogant and the smile that accompanied it did not please me
i therefore hesitated to reply
perhaps my former answer had implied too much he had heard my voice falter and might have seen me brush away a tear
are you going to forgive me helen he resumed more humbly
are you penitent i replied stepping up to him and smiling in his face
heartbroken he answered with a rueful countenance yet with a merry smile just lurking within his eyes and about the corners of his mouth but this could not repulse me and i flew into his arms
he fervently embraced me and though i shed a torrent of tears i think i never was happier in my life than at that moment
then you wont go to london arthur i said when the first transport of tears and kisses had subsided
no loveunless you will go with me i will gladly i answered if you think the change will amuse you and if you will put off the journey till next week he readily consented but said there was no need of much preparation as he should not be for staying long for he did not wish me to be londonized and to lose my country freshness and originality by too much intercourse with the ladies of the world
i thought this folly but i did not wish to contradict him now i merely said that i was of very domestic habits as he well knew and had no particular wish to mingle with the world
so we are to go to london on monday the day after tomorrow
it is now four days since the termination of our quarrel and i am sure it has done us both good it has made me like arthur a great deal better and made him behave a great deal better to me
he has never once attempted to annoy me since by the most distant allusion to lady f or any of those disagreeable reminiscences of his former life
i wish i could blot them from my memory or else get him to regard such matters in the same light as i do
well
it is something however to have made him see that they are not fit subjects for a conjugal jest
he may see further some time
i will put no limits to my hopes and in spite of my aunts forebodings and my own unspoken fears i trust we shall be happy yet
on the eighth of april we went to london on the eighth of may i returned in obedience to arthurs wish very much against my own because i left him behind
if he had come with me i should have been very glad to get home again for he led me such a round of restless dissipation while there that in that short space of time i was quite tired out
he seemed bent upon displaying me to his friends and acquaintances in particular and the public in general on every possible occasion and to the greatest possible advantage
it was something to feel that he considered me a worthy object of pride but i paid dear for the gratification for in the first place to please him i had to violate my cherished predilections my almost rooted principles in favour of a plain dark sober style of dressi must sparkle in costly jewels and deck myself out like a painted butterfly just as i had long since determined i would never doand this was no trifling sacrifice in the second place i was continually straining to satisfy his sanguine expectations and do honour to his choice by my general conduct and deportment and fearing to disappoint him by some awkward misdemeanour or some trait of inexperienced ignorance about the customs of society especially when i acted the part of hostess which i was not unfrequently called upon to do and in the third place as i intimated before i was wearied of the throng and bustle the restless hurry and ceaseless change of a life so alien to all my previous habits
at last he suddenly discovered that the london air did not agree with me and i was languishing for my country home and must immediately return to grassdale
i laughingly assured him that the case was not so urgent as he appeared to think it but i was quite willing to go home if he was
he replied that he should be obliged to remain a week or two longer as he had business that required his presence
illustration then i will stay with you said i
but i cant do with you helen was his answer as long as you stay i shall attend to you and neglect my business but i wont let you i returned now that i know you have business to attend to i shall insist upon your attending to it and letting me alone and to tell the truth i shall be glad of a little rest
i can take my rides and walks in the park as usual and your business cannot occupy all your time i shall see you at mealtimes and in the evenings at least and that will be better than being leagues away and never seeing you at all but my love i cannot let you stay
how can i settle my affairs when i know that you are here neglected i shall not feel myself neglected while you are doing your duty arthur i shall never complain of neglect
if you had told me before that you had anything to do it would have been half done before this and now you must make up for lost time by redoubled exertions
tell me what it is and i will be your taskmaster instead of being a hindrance no no persisted the impracticable creature you must go home helen i must have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe and well though far away
your bright eyes are faded and that tender delicate bloom has quite deserted your cheek that is only with too much gaiety and fatigue it is not i tell you it is the london air you are pining for the fresh breezes of your country home and you shall feel them before you are two days older
and remember your situation dearest helen on your health you know depends the health if not the life of our future hope then you really wish to get rid of me positively i do and i will take you down myself to grassdale and then return
i shall not be absent above a week or fortnight at most but if i must go i will go alone if you must stay it is needless to waste your time in the journey there and back but he did not like the idea of sending me alone
why what helpless creature do you take me for i replied that you cannot trust me to go a hundred miles in our own carriage with our own footman and a maid to attend me
if you come with me i shall assuredly keep you
but tell me arthur what is this tiresome business and why did you never mention it before it is only a little business with my lawyer said he and he told me something about a piece of property he wanted to sell in order to pay off a part of the incumbrances on his estate but either the account was a little confused or i was rather dull of comprehension for i could not clearly understand how that should keep him in town a fortnight after me
still less can i now comprehend how it should keep him a month for it is nearly that time since i left him and no signs of his return as yet
in every letter he promises to be with me in a few days and every time deceives me or deceives himself
his excuses are vague and insufficient
i cannot doubt that he has got among his former companions again
oh why did i leave him
i wishi do intensely wish he would return
june thno arthur yet and for many days i have been looking and longing in vain for a letter
his letters when they come are kind if fair words and endearing epithets can give them a claim to the titlebut very short and full of trivial excuses and promises that i cannot trust and yet how anxiously i look forward to them
how eagerly i open and devour one of those little hastilyscribbled returns for the three or four long letters hitherto unanswered he has had from me
oh it is cruel to leave me so long alone
he knows i have no one but rachel to speak to for we have no neighbours here except the hargraves whose residence i can dimly descry from these upper windows embosomed among those low woody hills beyond the dale
i was glad when i learnt that milicent was so near us and her company would be a soothing solace to me now but she is still in town with her mother there is no one at the grove but little esther and her french governess for walter is always away
i saw that paragon of manly perfections in london he seemed scarcely to merit the eulogiums of his mother and sister though he certainly appeared more conversable and agreeable than lord lowborough more candid and highminded than mr grimsby and more polished and gentlemanly than mr hattersley arthurs only other friend whom he judged fit to introduce to meoh arthur why wont you come
why wont you write to me at least
you talked about my health how can you expect me to gather bloom and vigour here pining in solitude and restless anxiety from day to dayit would serve you right to come back and find my good looks entirely wasted away
i would beg my uncle and aunt or my brother to come and see me but i do not like to complain of my loneliness to them and indeed loneliness is the least of my sufferings
but what is he doingwhat is it that keeps him away
it is this everrecurring question and the horrible suggestions it raises that distract me
july rdmy last bitter letter has wrung from him an answer at last and a rather longer one than usual but still i dont know what to make of it
he playfully abuses me for the gall and vinegar of my latest effusion tells me i can have no conception of the multitudinous engagements that keep him away but avers that in spite of them all he will assuredly be with me before the close of next week though it is impossible for a man so circumstanced as he is to fix the precise day of his return meantime he exhorts me to the exercise of patience that first of womans virtues and desires me to remember the saying absence makes the heart grow fonder and comfort myself with the assurance that the longer he stays away the better he shall love me when he returns and till he does return he begs i will continue to write to him constantly for though he is sometimes too idle and often too busy to answer my letters as they come he likes to receive them daily and if i fulfil my threat of punishing his seeming neglect by ceasing to write he shall be so angry that he will do his utmost to forget me
he adds this piece of intelligence respecting poor milicent hargrave your little friend milicent is likely before long to follow your example and take upon her the yoke of matrimony in conjunction with a friend of mine
hattersley you know has not yet fulfilled his direful threat of throwing his precious person away on the first old maid that chose to evince a tenderness for him but he still preserves a resolute determination to see himself a married man before the year is out
only said he to me i must have somebody that will let me have my own way in everythingnot like your wife huntingdon she is a charming creature but she looks as if she had a will of her own and could play the vixen upon occasion i thought youre right there man but i didnt say so
i must have some good quiet soul that will let me just do what i like and go where i like keep at home or stay away without a word of reproach or complaint for i cant do with being bothered well said i i know somebody that will suit you to a tee if you dont care for money and thats hargraves sister milicent he desired to be introduced to her forthwith for he said he had plenty of the needful himself or should have when his old governor chose to quit the stage
so you see helen i have managed pretty well both for your friend and mine poor milicent
but i cannot imagine she will ever be led to accept such a suitorone so repugnant to all her ideas of a man to be honoured and loved
thalas
i was mistaken
i have got a long letter from her this morning telling me she is already engaged and expects to be married before the close of the month
i hardly know what to say about it she writes or what to think
to tell you the truth helen i dont like the thoughts of it at all
if i am to be mr hattersleys wife i must try to love him and i do try with all my might but i have made very little progress yet and the worst symptom of the case is that the further he is from me the better i like him he frightens me with his abrupt manners and strange hectoring ways and i dread the thoughts of marrying him
then why have you accepted him you will ask and i didnt know i had accepted him but mamma tells me i have and he seems to think so too
i certainly didnt mean to do so but i did not like to give him a flat refusal for fear mamma should be grieved and angry for i knew she wished me to marry him and i wanted to talk to her first about it so i gave him what i thought was an evasive half negative answer but she says it was as good as an acceptance and he would think me very capricious if i were to attempt to draw backand indeed i was so confused and frightened at the moment i can hardly tell what i said
and next time i saw him he accosted me in all confidence as his affianced bride and immediately began to settle matters with mamma
i had not courage to contradict them then and how can i do it now
i cannot they would think me mad
besides mamma is so delighted with the idea of the match she thinks she has managed so well for me and i cannot bear to disappoint her
i do object sometimes and tell her what i feel but you dont know how she talks
mr hattersley you know is the son of a rich banker and as esther and i have no fortunes and walter very little our dear mamma is very anxious to see us all well married that is united to rich partners
it is not my idea of being well married but she means it all for the best
she says when i am safe off her hands it will be such a relief to her mind and she assures me it will be a good thing for the family as well as for me
even walter is pleased at the prospect and when i confessed my reluctance to him he said it was all childish nonsense
do you think it nonsense helen
i should not care if i could see any prospect of being able to love and admire him but i cant
there is nothing about him to hang ones esteem and affection upon he is so diametrically opposite to what i imagined my husband should be
do write to me and say all you can to encourage me
dont attempt to dissuade me for my fate is fixed preparations for the important event are already going on around me and dont say a word against mr hattersley for i want to think well of him and though i have spoken against him myself it is for the last time hereafter i shall never permit myself to utter a word in his dispraise however he may seem to deserve it and whoever ventures to speak slightingly of the man i have promised to love to honour and obey must expect my serious displeasure
after all i think he is quite as good as mr huntingdon if not better and yet you love him and seem to be happy and contented and perhaps i may manage as well
you must tell me if you can that mr hattersley is better than he seemsthat he is upright honourable and openheartedin fact a perfect diamond in the rough
he may be all this but i dont know him
i know only the exterior and what i trust is the worst part of him she concludes with goodby dear helen
i am waiting anxiously for your advicebut mind you let it be all on the right side alas
poor milicent what encouragement can i give you
or what adviceexcept that it is better to make a bold stand now though at the expense of disappointing and angering both mother and brother and lover than to devote your whole life hereafter to misery and vain regret
saturday ththe week is over and he is not come
all the sweet summer is passing away without one breath of pleasure to me or benefit to him
and i had all along been looking forward to this season with the fond delusive hope that we should enjoy it so sweetly together and that with gods help and my exertions it would be the means of elevating his mind and refining his taste to a due appreciation of the salutary and pure delights of nature and peace and holy love
but nowat evening when i see the round red sun sink quietly down behind those woody hills leaving them sleeping in a warm red golden haze i only think another lovely day is lost to him and me and at morning when roused by the flutter and chirp of the sparrows and the gleeful twitter of the swallowsall intent upon feeding their young and full of life and joy in their own little framesi open the window to inhale the balmy soulreviving air and look out upon the lovely landscape laughing in dew and sunshinei too often shame that glorious scene with tears of thankless misery because he cannot feel its freshening influence and when i wander in the ancient woods and meet the little wild flowers smiling in my path or sit in the shadow of our noble ashtrees by the waterside with their branches gently swaying in the light summer breeze that murmurs through their feathery foliagemy ears full of that low music mingled with the dreamy hum of insects my eyes abstractedly gazing on the glassy surface of the little lake before me with the trees that crowd about its bank some gracefully bending to kiss its waters some rearing their stately heads high above but stretching their wide arms over its margin all faithfully mirrored far far down in its glassy depththough sometimes the images are partially broken by the sport of aquatic insects and sometimes for a moment the whole is shivered into trembling fragments by a transient breeze that sweeps the surface too roughlystill i have no pleasure for the greater the happiness that nature sets before me the more i lament that he is not here to taste it the greater the bliss we might enjoy together the more i feel our present wretchedness apart yes ours he must be wretched though he may not know it and the more my senses are pleased the more my heart is oppressed for he keeps it with him confined amid the dust and smoke of londonperhaps shut up within the walls of his own abominable club
but most of all at night when i enter my lonely chamber and look out upon the summer moon sweet regent of the sky floating above me in the black blue vault of heaven shedding a flood of silver radiance over park and wood and water so pure so peaceful so divineand think where is he nowwhat is he doing at this moment
wholly unconscious of this heavenly sceneperhaps revelling with his boon companions perhapsgod help me it is tootoo much
rdthank heaven he is come at last
but how altered
flushed and feverish listless and languid his beauty strangely diminished his vigour and vivacity quite departed
i have not upbraided him by word or look i have not even asked him what he has been doing
i have not the heart to do it for i think he is ashamed of himselfhe must be so indeed and such inquiries could not fail to be painful to both
my forbearance pleases himtouches him even i am inclined to think
he says he is glad to be home again and god knows how glad i am to get him back even as he is
he lies on the sofa nearly all day long and i play and sing to him for hours together
i write his letters for him and get him everything he wants and sometimes i read to him and sometimes i talk and sometimes only sit by him and soothe him with silent caresses
i know he does not deserve it and i fear i am spoiling him but this once i will forgive him freely and entirely
i will shame him into virtue if i can and i will never let him leave me again
he is pleased with my attentionsit may be grateful for them
he likes to have me near him and though he is peevish and testy with his servants and his dogs he is gentle and kind to me
what he would be if i did not so watchfully anticipate his wants and so carefully avoid or immediately desist from doing anything that has a tendency to irritate or disturb him with however little reason i cannot tell
how intensely i wish he were worthy of all this care
last night as i sat beside him with his head in my lap passing my fingers through his beautiful curls this thought made my eyes overflow with sorrowful tearsas it often does but this time a tear fell on his face and made him look up
he smiled but not insultingly
dear helen he saidwhy do you cry
you know that i love you and he pressed my hand to his feverish lips and what more could you desire only arthur that you would love yourself as truly and as faithfully as you are loved by me that would be hard indeed he replied tenderly squeezing my hand
august tharthur is himself again as lusty and reckless as light of heart and head as ever and as restless and hard to amuse as a spoilt child and almost as full of mischief too especially when wet weather keeps him within doors
i wish he had something to do some useful trade or profession or employmentanything to occupy his head or his hands for a few hours a day and give him something besides his own pleasure to think about
if he would play the country gentleman and attend to the farmbut that he knows nothing about and wont give his mind to consideror if he would take up with some literary study or learn to draw or to playas he is so fond of music i often try to persuade him to learn the piano but he is far too idle for such an undertaking he has no more idea of exerting himself to overcome obstacles than he has of restraining his natural appetites and these two things are the ruin of him
i lay them both to the charge of his harsh yet careless father and his madly indulgent motherif ever i am a mother i will zealously strive against this crime of overindulgence
i can hardly give it a milder name when i think of the evils it brings
happily it will soon be the shooting season and then if the weather permit he will find occupation enough in the pursuit and destruction of the partridges and pheasants we have no grouse or he might have been similarly occupied at this moment instead of lying under the acaciatree pulling poor dashs ears
but he says it is dull work shooting alone he must have a friend or two to help him
let them be tolerably decent then arthur said i
the word friend in his mouth makes me shudder i know it was some of his friends that induced him to stay behind me in london and kept him away so long indeed from what he has unguardedly told me or hinted from time to time i cannot doubt that he frequently showed them my letters to let them see how fondly his wife watched over his interests and how keenly she regretted his absence and that they induced him to remain week after week and to plunge into all manner of excesses to avoid being laughed at for a wiferidden fool and perhaps to show how far he could venture to go without danger of shaking the fond creatures devoted attachment
it is a hateful idea but i cannot believe it is a false one
well replied he i thought of lord lowborough for one but there is no possibility of getting him without his better half our mutual friend annabella so we must ask them both
youre not afraid of her are you helen he asked with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes
of course not i answered why should i
and who besides hargrave for one
he will be glad to come though his own place is so near for he has little enough land of his own to shoot over and we can extend our depredations into it if we like and he is thoroughly respectable you know helenquite a ladys man and i think grimsby for another hes a decent quiet fellow enough
youll not object to grimsby i hate him but however if you wish it ill try to endure his presence for a while all a prejudice helen a mere womans antipathy no i have solid grounds for my dislike
and is that all why yes i think so
hattersley will be too busy billing and cooing with his bride to have much time to spare for guns and dogs at present he replied
and that reminds me that i have had several letters from milicent since her marriage and that she either is or pretends to be quite reconciled to her lot
she professes to have discovered numberless virtues and perfections in her husband some of which i fear less partial eyes would fail to distinguish though they sought them carefully with tears and now that she is accustomed to his loud voice and abrupt uncourteous manners she affirms she finds no difficulty in loving him as a wife should do and begs i will burn that letter wherein she spoke so unadvisedly against him
so that i trust she may yet be happy but if she is it will be entirely the reward of her own goodness of heart for had she chosen to consider herself the victim of fate or of her mothers worldly wisdom she might have been thoroughly miserable and if for dutys sake she had not made every effort to love her husband she would doubtless have hated him to the end of her days
sept rdour guests arrived about three weeks ago
lord and lady lowborough have now been married above eight months and i will do the lady the credit to say that her husband is quite an altered man his looks his spirits and his temper are all perceptibly changed for the better since i last saw him
but there is room for improvement still
he is not always cheerful nor always contented and she often complains of his illhumour which however of all persons she ought to be the last to accuse him of as he never displays it against her except for such conduct as would provoke a saint
he adores her still and would go to the worlds end to please her
she knows her power and she uses it too but well knowing that to wheedle and coax is safer than to command she judiciously tempers her despotism with flattery and blandishments enough to make him deem himself a favoured and a happy man
but she has a way of tormenting him in which i am a fellowsufferer or might be if i chose to regard myself as such
this is by openly but not too glaringly coquetting with mr huntingdon who is quite willing to be her partner in the game but i dont care for it because with him i know there is nothing but personal vanity and a mischievous desire to excite my jealousy and perhaps to torment his friend and she no doubt is actuated by much the same motives only there is more of malice and less of playfulness in her manuvres
it is obviously therefore my interest to disappoint them both as far as i am concerned by preserving a cheerful undisturbed serenity throughout and accordingly i endeavour to show the fullest confidence in my husband and the greatest indifference to the arts of my attractive guest
i have never reproached the former but once and that was for laughing at lord lowboroughs depressed and anxious countenance one evening when they had both been particularly provoking and then indeed i said a good deal on the subject and rebuked him sternly enough but he only laughed and saidyou can feel for him helen cant you i can feel for anyone that is unjustly treated i replied and i can feel for those that injure them too why helen you are as jealous as he is cried he laughing still more and i found it impossible to convince him of his mistake
so from that time i have carefully refrained from any notice of the subject whatever and left lord lowborough to take care of himself
he either has not the sense or the power to follow my example though he does try to conceal his uneasiness as well as he can but still it will appear in his face and his illhumour will peep out at intervals though not in the expression of open resentmentthey never go far enough for that
but i confess i do feel jealous at times most painfully bitterly so when she sings and plays to him and he hangs over the instrument and dwells upon her voice with no affected interest for then i know he is really delighted and i have no power to awaken similar fervour
i can amuse and please him with my simple songs but not delight him thus
thyesterday we all went to the grove mr hargraves muchneglected home
his mother frequently asks us over that she may have the pleasure of her dear walters company and this time she had invited us to a dinnerparty and got together as many of the country gentry as were within reach to meet us
the entertainment was very well got up but i could not help thinking about the cost of it all the time
i dont like mrs hargrave she is a hard pretentious worldlyminded woman
she has money enough to live very comfortably if she only knew how to use it judiciously and had taught her son to do the same but she is ever straining to keep up appearances with that despicable pride that shuns the semblance of poverty as of a shameful crime
she grinds her dependents pinches her servants and deprives even her daughters and herself of the real comforts of life because she will not consent to yield the palm in outward show to those who have three times her wealth and above all because she is determined her cherished son shall be enabled to hold up his head with the highest gentlemen in the land this same son i imagine is a man of expensive habits no reckless spendthrift and no abandoned sensualist but one who likes to have everything handsome about him and to go to a certain length in youthful indulgences not so much to gratify his own tastes as to maintain his reputation as a man of fashion in the world and a respectable fellow among his own lawless companions while he is too selfish to consider how many comforts might be obtained for his fond mother and sisters with the money he thus wastes upon himself as long as they can contrive to make a respectable appearance once a year when they come to town he gives himself little concern about their private stintings and struggles at home
this is a harsh judgment to form of dear nobleminded generoushearted walter but i fear it is too just
mrs hargraves anxiety to make good matches for her daughters is partly the cause and partly the result of these errors by making a figure in the world and showing them off to advantage she hopes to obtain better chances for them and by thus living beyond her legitimate means and lavishing so much on their brother she renders them portionless and makes them burdens on her hands
poor milicent i fear has already fallen a sacrifice to the manuvrings of this mistaken mother who congratulates herself on having so satisfactorily discharged her maternal duty and hopes to do as well for esther
but esther is a child as yet a little merry romp of fourteen as honesthearted and as guileless and simple as her sister but with a fearless spirit of her own that i fancy her mother will find some difficulty in bending to her purposes
october thit was on the night of the th a little after tea that annabella had been singing and playing with arthur as usual at her side she had ended her song but still she sat at the instrument and he stood leaning on the back of her chair conversing in scarcely audible tones with his face in very close proximity with hers
i looked at lord lowborough
he was at the other end of the room talking with messrs hargrave and grimsby but i saw him dart towards his lady and his host a quick impatient glance expressive of intense disquietude at which grimsby smiled
determined to interrupt the ttette i rose and selecting a piece of music from the music stand stepped up to the piano intending to ask the lady to play it but i stood transfixed and speechless on seeing her seated there listening with what seemed an exultant smile on her flushed face to his soft murmurings with her hand quietly surrendered to his clasp
the blood rushed first to my heart and then to my head for there was more than this almost at the moment of my approach he cast a hurried glance over his shoulder towards the other occupants of the room and then ardently pressed the unresisting hand to his lips
on raising his eyes he beheld me and dropped them again confounded and dismayed
she saw me too and confronted me with a look of hard defiance
i laid the music on the piano and retired
i felt ill but i did not leave the room happily it was getting late and could not be long before the company dispersed
i went to the fire and leant my head against the chimneypiece
in a minute or two some one asked me if i felt unwell
i did not answer indeed at the time i knew not what was said but i mechanically looked up and saw mr hargrave standing beside me on the rug
shall i get you a glass of wine said he
no thank you i replied and turning from him i looked round
lady lowborough was beside her husband bending over him as he sat with her hand on his shoulder softly talking and smiling in his face and arthur was at the table turning over a book of engravings
i seated myself in the nearest chair and mr hargrave finding his services were not desired judiciously withdrew
shortly after the company broke up and as the guests were retiring to their rooms arthur approached me smiling with the utmost assurance
are you very angry helen murmured he
this is no jest arthur said i seriously but as calmly as i couldunless you think it a jest to lose my affection for ever what
so bitter he exclaimed laughingly clasping my hand between both his but i snatched it away in indignationalmost in disgust for he was obviously affected with wine
then i must go down on my knees said he and kneeling before me with clasped hands uplifted in mock humiliation he continued imploringlyforgive me helendear helen forgive me and ill never do it again and burying his face in his handkerchief he affected to sob aloud
leaving him thus employed i took my candle and slipping quietly from the room hastened upstairs as fast as i could
but he soon discovered that i had left him and rushing up after me caught me in his arms just as i had entered the chamber and was about to shut the door in his face
no no by heaven you shant escape me so he cried
then alarmed at my agitation he begged me not to put myself in such a passion telling me i was white in the face and should kill myself if i did so
let me go then i murmured and immediately he released meand it was well he did for i was really in a passion
i sank into the easychair and endeavoured to compose myself for i wanted to speak to him calmly
he stood beside me but did not venture to touch me or to speak for a few seconds then approaching a little nearer he dropped on one kneenot in mock humility but to bring himself nearer my level and leaning his hand on the arm of the chair he began in a low voice it is all nonsense helena jest a mere nothingnot worth a thought
will you never learn he continued more boldly that you have nothing to fear from me
that i love you wholly and entirelyor if he added with a lurking smile i ever give a thought to another you may well spare it for those fancies are here and gone like a flash of lightning while my love for you burns on steadily and for ever like the sun
you little exorbitant tyrant will not that be quiet a moment will you arthur said i and listen to meand dont think im in a jealous fury i am perfectly calm
feel my hand and i gravely extended it towards himbut closed it upon his with an energy that seemed to disprove the assertion and made him smile
you neednt smile sir said i still tightening my grasp and looking steadfastly on him till he almost quailed before me
you may think it all very fine mr huntingdon to amuse yourself with rousing my jealousy but take care you dont rouse my hate instead
and when you have once extinguished my love you will find it no easy matter to kindle it again well helen i wont repeat the offence
but i meant nothing by it i assure you
i had taken too much wine and i was scarcely myself at the time you often take too much and that is another practice i detest he looked up astonished at my warmth
yes i continued i never mentioned it before because i was ashamed to do so but now ill tell you that it distresses me and may disgust me if you go on and suffer the habit to grow upon you as it will if you dont check it in time
but the whole system of your conduct to lady lowborough is not referable to wine and this night you knew perfectly well what you were doing well im sorry for it replied he with more of sulkiness than contrition what more would you have you are sorry that i saw you no doubt i answered coldly
if you had not seen me he muttered fixing his eyes on the carpet it would have done no harm my heart felt ready to burst but i resolutely swallowed back my emotion and answered calmly you think not no replied he boldly
after all what have i done
its nothingexcept as you choose to make it a subject of accusation and distress what would lord lowborough your friend think if he knew all
or what would you yourself think if he or any other had acted the same part to me throughout as you have to annabella i would blow his brains out well then arthur how can you call it nothingan offence for which you would think yourself justified in blowing another mans brains out
is it nothing to trifle with your friends feelings and mineto endeavour to steal a womans affections from her husbandwhat he values more than his gold and therefore what it is more dishonest to take
are the marriage vows a jest and is it nothing to make it your sport to break them and to tempt another to do the same
can i love a man that does such things and coolly maintains it is nothing you are breaking your marriage vows yourself said he indignantly rising and pacing to and fro
you promised to honour and obey me and now you attempt to hector over me and threaten and accuse me and call me worse than a highwayman
if it were not for your situation helen i would not submit to it so tamely
i wont be dictated to by a woman though she be my wife what will you do then
will you go on till i hate you and then accuse me of breaking my vows he was silent a moment and then replied you never will hate me returning and resuming his former position at my feet he repeated more vehementlyyou cannot hate me as long as i love you but how can i believe that you love me if you continue to act in this way
just imagine yourself in my place would you think i loved you if i did so
would you believe my protestations and honour and trust me under such circumstances the cases are different he replied
it is a womans nature to be constantto love one and one only blindly tenderly and for everbless them dear creatures
and you above them all but you must have some commiseration for us helen you must give us a little more licence for as shakespeare has it however we do praise ourselves our fancies are more giddy and unfirm more longing wavering sooner lost and won than womens are do you mean by that that your fancies are lost to me and won by lady lowborough no
heaven is my witness that i think her mere dust and ashes in comparison with you and shall continue to think so unless you drive me from you by too much severity
she is a daughter of earth you are an angel of heaven only be not too austere in your divinity and remember that i am a poor fallible mortal
come now helen wont you forgive me he said gently taking my hand and looking up with an innocent smile
if i do you will repeat the offence i swear by dont swear ill believe your word as well as your oath
i wish i could have confidence in either try me then helen only trust and pardon me this once and you shall see
come i am in hells torments till you speak the word i did not speak it but i put my hand on his shoulder and kissed his forehead and then burst into tears
he embraced me tenderly and we have been good friends ever since
he has been decently temperate at table and wellconducted towards lady lowborough
the first day he held himself aloof from her as far as he could without any flagrant breach of hospitality since that he has been friendly and civil but nothing morein my presence at least nor i think at any other time for she seems haughty and displeased and lord lowborough is manifestly more cheerful and more cordial towards his host than before
but i shall be glad when they are gone for i have so little love for annabella that it is quite a task to be civil to her and as she is the only woman here besides myself we are necessarily thrown so much together
next time mrs hargrave calls i shall hail her advent as quite a relief
i have a good mind to ask arthurs leave to invite the old lady to stay with us till our guests depart
i think i will
she will take it as a kind attention and though i have little relish for her society she will be truly welcome as a third to stand between lady lowborough and me
the first time the latter and i were alone together after that unhappy evening was an hour or two after breakfast on the following day when the gentlemen were gone out after the usual time spent in the writing of letters the reading of newspapers and desultory conversation
we sat silent for two or three minutes
she was busy with her work and i was running over the columns of a paper from which i had extracted all the pith some twenty minutes before
it was a moment of painful embarrassment to me and i thought it must be infinitely more so to her but it seems i was mistaken
she was the first to speak and smiling with the coolest assurance she began your husband was merry last night helen is he often so my blood boiled in my face but it was better she should seem to attribute his conduct to this than to anything else
no replied i and never will be so again i trust you gave him a curtain lecture did you no
but i told him i disliked such conduct and he promised me not to repeat it i thought he looked rather subdued this morning she continued and you helen
youve been weeping i seethats our grand resource you know
but doesnt it make your eyes smart
and do you always find it to answer i never cry for effect nor can i conceive how any one can well i dont know i never had occasion to try it but i think if lowborough were to commit such improprieties id make him cry
i dont wonder at your being angry for im sure id give my husband a lesson he would not soon forget for a lighter offence than that
but then he never will do anything of the kind for i keep him in too good order for that are you sure you dont arrogate too much of the credit to yourself
lord lowborough was quite as remarkable for his abstemiousness for some time before you married him as he is now i have heard oh about the wine you meanyes hes safe enough for that
and as to looking askance to another woman hes safe enough for that too while i live for he worships the very ground i tread on indeed
and are you sure you deserve it why as to that i cant say you know were all fallible creatures helen we none of us deserve to be worshipped
but are you sure your darling huntingdon deserves all the love you give to him i knew not what to answer to this
i was burning with anger but i suppressed all outward manifestations of it and only bit my lip and pretended to arrange my work
at any rate resumed she pursuing her advantage you can console yourself with the assurance that you are worthy of all the love he gives to you you flatter me said i but at least i can try to be worthy of it and then i turned the conversation
december thlast christmas i was a bride with a heart overflowing with present bliss and full of ardent hopes for the future though not unmingled with foreboding fears
now i am a wife my bliss is sobered but not destroyed my hopes diminished but not departed my fears increased but not yet thoroughly confirmed and thank heaven i am a mother too
god has sent me a soul to educate for heaven and give me a new and calmer bliss and stronger hopes to comfort me
dec th another year is gone
my little arthur lives and thrives
he is healthy but not robust full of gentle playfulness and vivacity already affectionate and susceptible of passions and emotions it will be long ere he can find words to express
he has won his fathers heart at last and now my constant terror is lest he should be ruined by that fathers thoughtless indulgence
but i must beware of my own weakness too for i never knew till now how strong are a parents temptations to spoil an only child
i have need of consolation in my son for to this silent paper i may confess it i have but little in my husband
i love him still and he loves me in his own waybut oh how different from the love i could have given and once had hoped to receive
how little real sympathy there exists between us how many of my thoughts and feelings are gloomily cloistered within my own mind how much of my higher and better self is indeed unmarrieddoomed either to harden and sour in the sunless shade of solitude or to quite degenerate and fall away for lack of nutriment in this unwholesome soil
but i repeat i have no right to complain only let me state the truthsome of the truth at leastand see hereafter if any darker truths will blot these pages
we have now been full two years united the romance of our attachment must be worn away
surely i have now got down to the lowest gradation in arthurs affection and discovered all the evils of his nature if there be any further change it must be for the better as we become still more accustomed to each other surely we shall find no lower depth than this
and if so i can bear it wellas well at least as i have borne it hitherto
arthur is not what is commonly called a bad man he has many good qualities but he is a man without selfrestraint or lofty aspirations a lover of pleasure given up to animal enjoyments he is not a bad husband but his notions of matrimonial duties and comforts are not my notions
judging from appearances his idea of a wife is a thing to love one devotedly and to stay at home to wait upon her husband and amuse him and minister to his comfort in every possible way while he chooses to stay with her and when he is absent to attend to his interests domestic or otherwise and patiently wait his return no matter how he may be occupied in the meantime
early in spring he announced his intention of going to london his affairs there demanded his attendance he said and he could refuse it no longer
he expressed his regret at having to leave me but hoped i would amuse myself with the baby till he returned
but why leave me i said
i can go with you i can be ready at any time you would not take that child to town yes why not the thing was absurd the air of the town would be certain to disagree with him and with me as a nurse the late hours and london habits would not suit me under such circumstances and altogether he assured me that it would be excessively troublesome injurious and unsafe
i overruled his objections as well as i could for i trembled at the thoughts of his going alone and would sacrifice almost anything for myself much even for my child to prevent it but at length he told me plainly and somewhat testily that he could not do with me he was worn out with the babys restless nights and must have some repose
i proposed separate apartments but it would not do
the truth is arthur i said at last you are weary of my company and determined not to have me with you
you might as well have said so at once he denied it but i immediately left the room and flew to the nursery to hide my feelings if i could not soothe them there
i was too much hurt to express any further dissatisfaction with his plans or at all to refer to the subject again except for the necessary arrangements concerning his departure and the conduct of affairs during his absence till the day before he went when i earnestly exhorted him to take care of himself and keep out of the way of temptation
he laughed at my anxiety but assured me there was no cause for it and promised to attend to my advice
i suppose it is no use asking you to fix a day for your return said i
why no i hardly can under the circumstances but be assured love i shall not be long away i dont wish to keep you a prisoner at home i replied i should not grumble at your staying whole months awayif you can be happy so long without meprovided i knew you were safe but i dont like the idea of your being there among your friends as you call them pooh pooh you silly girl
do you think i cant take care of myself you didnt last time
but this time arthur i added earnestly show me that you can and teach me that i need not fear to trust you he promised fair but in such a manner as we seek to soothe a child
and did he keep his promise
no and henceforth i can never trust his word
bitter bitter confession
tears blind me while i write
it was early in march that he went and he did not return till july
this time he did not trouble himself to make excuses as before and his letters were less frequent and shorter and less affectionate especially after the first few weeks they came slower and slower and more terse and careless every time
but still when i omitted writing he complained of my neglect
when i wrote sternly and coldly as i confess i frequently did at the last he blamed my harshness and said it was enough to scare him from his home when i tried mild persuasion he was a little more gentle in his replies and promised to return but i had learnt at last to disregard his promises
those were four miserable months alternating between intense anxiety despair and indignation pity for him and pity for myself
and yet through all i was not wholly comfortless i had my darling sinless inoffensive little one to console me but even this consolation was embittered by the constantlyrecurring thought how shall i teach him hereafter to respect his father and yet to avoid his example but i remembered that i had brought all these afflictions in a manner wilfully upon myself and i determined to bear them without a murmur
at the same time i resolved not to give myself up to misery for the transgressions of another and endeavoured to divert myself as much as i could and besides the companionship of my child and my dear faithful rachel who evidently guessed my sorrows and felt for them though she was too discreet to allude to them i had my books and pencil my domestic affairs and the welfare and comfort of arthurs poor tenants and labourers to attend to and i sometimes sought and obtained amusement in the company of my young friend esther hargrave occasionally i rode over to see her and once or twice i had her to spend the day with me at the manor
mrs hargrave did not visit london that season having no daughter to marry she thought it as well to stay at home and economise and for a wonder walter came down to join her in the beginning of june and stayed till near the close of august
the first time i saw him was on a sweet warm evening when i was sauntering in the park with little arthur and rachel who is headnurse and ladysmaid in onefor with my secluded life and tolerably active habits i require but little attendance and as she had nursed me and coveted to nurse my child and was moreover so very trustworthy i preferred committing the important charge to her with a young nurserymaid under her directions to engaging any one else besides it saves money and since i have made acquaintance with arthurs affairs i have learnt to regard that as no trifling recommendation for by my own desire nearly the whole of the income of my fortune is devoted for years to come to the paying off of his debts and the money he contrives to squander away in london is incomprehensible
but to return to mr hargrave
i was standing with rachel beside the water amusing the laughing baby in her arms with a twig of willow laden with golden catkins when greatly to my surprise he entered the park mounted on his costly black hunter and crossed over the grass to meet me
he saluted me with a very fine compliment delicately worded and modestly delivered withal which he had doubtless concocted as he rode along
he told me he had brought a message from his mother who as he was riding that way had desired him to call at the manor and beg the pleasure of my company to a friendly family dinner tomorrow
there is no one to meet but ourselves said he but esther is very anxious to see you and my mother fears you will feel solitary in this great house so much alone and wishes she could persuade you to give her the pleasure of your company more frequently and make yourself at home in our more humble dwelling till mr huntingdons return shall render this a little more conducive to your comfort she is very kind i answered but i am not alone you seeand those whose time is fully occupied seldom complain of solitude will you not come tomorrow then
she will be sadly disappointed if you refuse i did not relish being thus compassionated for my loneliness but however i promised to come
what a sweet evening this is observed he looking round upon the sunny park with its imposing swell and slope its placid water and majestic clumps of trees
and what a paradise you live in it is a lovely evening answered i and i sighed to think how little i had felt its loveliness and how little of a paradise sweet grassdale was to mehow still less to the voluntary exile from its scenes
whether mr hargrave divined my thoughts i cannot tell but with a halfhesitating sympathising seriousness of tone and manner he asked if i had lately heard from mr huntingdon
not lately i replied
i thought not he muttered as if to himself looking thoughtfully on the ground
are you not lately returned from london i asked
only yesterday and did you see him there yesi saw him was he well yesthat is said he with increasing hesitation and an appearance of suppressed indignation he was as well asas he deserved to be but under circumstances i should have deemed incredible for a man so favoured as he is he here looked up and pointed the sentence with a serious bow to me
i suppose my face was crimson
pardon me mrs huntingdon he continued but i cannot suppress my indignation when i behold such infatuated blindness and perversion of tastebut perhaps you are not aware he paused
i am aware of nothing sirexcept that he delays his coming longer than i expected and if at present he prefers the society of his friends to that of his wife and the dissipations of the town to the quiet of country life i suppose i have those friends to thank for it
their tastes and occupations are similar to his and i dont see why his conduct should awaken either their indignation or surprise you wrong me cruelly answered he
i have shared but little of mr huntingdons society for the last few weeks and as for his tastes and occupations they are quite beyond melonely wanderer as i am
where i have but sipped and tasted he drains the cup to the dregs and if ever for a moment i have sought to drown the voice of reflection in madness and folly or if i have wasted too much of my time and talents among reckless and dissipated companions god knows i would gladly renounce them entirely and for ever if i had but half the blessings that man so thanklessly casts behind his backbut half the inducements to virtue and domestic orderly habits that he despisesbut such a home and such a partner to share it
it is infamous he muttered between his teeth
and dont think mrs huntingdon he added aloud that i could be guilty of inciting him to persevere in his present pursuits on the contrary i have remonstrated with him again and again i have frequently expressed my surprise at his conduct and reminded him of his duties and his privilegesbut to no purpose he only enough mr hargrave you ought to be aware that whatever my husbands faults may be it can only aggravate the evil for me to hear them from a strangers lips am i then a stranger said he in a sorrowful tone
i am your nearest neighbour your sons godfather and your husbands friend may i not be yours also intimate acquaintance must precede real friendship i know but little of you mr hargrave except from report have you then forgotten the six or seven weeks i spent under your roof last autumn
i have not forgotten them
and i know enough of you mrs huntingdon to think that your husband is the most enviable man in the world and i should be the next if you would deem me worthy of your friendship if you knew more of me you would not think it or if you did you would not say it and expect me to be flattered by the compliment i stepped backward as i spoke
he saw that i wished the conversation to end and immediately taking the hint he gravely bowed wished me goodevening and turned his horse towards the road
he appeared grieved and hurt at my unkind reception of his sympathising overtures
i was not sure that i had done right in speaking so harshly to him but at the time i had felt irritatedalmost insulted by his conduct it seemed as if he was presuming upon the absence and neglect of my husband and insinuating even more than the truth against him
rachel had moved on during our conversation to some yards distance
he rode up to her and asked to see the child
he took it carefully into his arms looked upon it with an almost paternal smile and i heard him say as i approached and this too he has forsaken he then tenderly kissed it and restored it to the gratified nurse
are you fond of children mr hargrave said i a little softened towards him
not in general he replied but that is such a sweet child and so like its mother he added in a lower tone
you are mistaken there it is its father it resembles am i not right nurse said he appealing to rachel
i think sir theres a bit of both she replied
he departed and rachel pronounced him a very nice gentleman
i had still my doubts on the subject
in the course of the following six weeks i met him several times but always save once in company with his mother or his sister or both
when i called on them he always happened to be at home and when they called on me it was always he that drove them over in the phaeton
his mother evidently was quite delighted with his dutiful attentions and newlyacquired domestic habits
the time that i met him alone was on a bright but not oppressively hot day in the beginning of july i had taken little arthur into the wood that skirts the park and there seated him on the mosscushioned roots of an old oak and having gathered a handful of bluebells and wildroses i was kneeling before him and presenting them one by one to the grasp of his tiny fingers enjoying the heavenly beauty of the flowers through the medium of his smiling eyes forgetting for the moment all my cares laughing at his gleeful laughter and delighting myself with his delightwhen a shadow suddenly eclipsed the little space of sunshine on the grass before us and looking up i beheld walter hargrave standing and gazing upon us
excuse me mrs huntingdon said he but i was spellbound i had neither the power to come forward and interrupt you nor to withdraw from the contemplation of such a scene
how vigorous my little godson grows
and how merry he is this morning he approached the child and stooped to take his hand but on seeing that his caresses were likely to produce tears and lamentations instead of a reciprocation of friendly demonstrations he prudently drew back
what a pleasure and comfort that little creature must be to you mrs huntingdon he observed with a touch of sadness in his intonation as he admiringly contemplated the infant
it is replied i and then i asked after his mother and sister
he politely answered my inquiries and then returned again to the subject i wished to avoid though with a degree of timidity that witnessed his fear to offend
you have not heard from huntingdon lately he said
not this week i replied
not these three weeks i might have said
i had a letter from him this morning
i wish it were such a one as i could show to his lady he half drew from his waistcoatpocket a letter with arthurs still beloved hand on the address scowled at it and put it back again addingbut he tells me he is about to return next week he tells me so every time he writes indeed
well it is like him
but to me he always avowed it his intention to stay till the present month it struck me like a blow this proof of premeditated transgression and systematic disregard of truth
it is only of a piece with the rest of his conduct observed mr hargrave thoughtfully regarding me and reading i suppose my feelings in my face
then he is really coming next week said i after a pause
you may rely upon it if the assurance can give you any pleasure
and is it possible mrs huntingdon that you can rejoice at his return he exclaimed attentively perusing my features again
of course mr hargrave is he not my husband oh huntingdon you know not what you slight he passionately murmured
i took up my baby and wishing him goodmorning departed to indulge my thoughts unscrutinized within the sanctum of my home
and was i glad
yes delighted though i was angered by arthurs conduct and though i felt that he had wronged me and was determined he should feel it too
on the following morning i received a few lines from him myself confirming hargraves intimations respecting his approaching return
and he did come next week but in a condition of body and mind even worse than before
i did not however intend to pass over his derelictions this time without a remark i found it would not do
but the first day he was weary with his journey and i was glad to get him back i would not upbraid him then i would wait till tomorrow
next morning he was weary still i would wait a little longer
but at dinner when after breakfasting at twelve oclock on a bottle of sodawater and a cup of strong coffee and lunching at two on another bottle of sodawater mingled with brandy he was finding fault with everything on the table and declaring we must change our cook i thought the time was come
it is the same cook as we had before you went arthur said i
you were generally pretty well satisfied with her then you must have been letting her get into slovenly habits then while i was away
it is enough to poison one eating such a disgusting mess and he pettishly pushed away his plate and leant back despairingly in his chair
i think it is you that are changed not she said i but with the utmost gentleness for i did not wish to irritate him
it may be so he replied carelessly as he seized a tumbler of wine and water adding when he had tossed it off for i have an infernal fire in my veins that all the waters of the ocean cannot quench what kindled it i was about to ask but at that moment the butler entered and began to take away the things
be quick benson do have done with that infernal clatter cried his master
and dont bring the cheese unless you want to make me sick outright benson in some surprise removed the cheese and did his best to effect a quiet and speedy clearance of the rest but unfortunately there was a rumple in the carpet caused by the hasty pushing back of his masters chair at which he tripped and stumbled causing a rather alarming concussion with the trayful of crockery in his hands but no positive damage save the fall and breaking of a sauce tureen but to my unspeakable shame and dismay arthur turned furiously around upon him and swore at him with savage coarseness
the poor man turned pale and visibly trembled as he stooped to pick up the fragments
he couldnt help it arthur said i the carpet caught his foot and theres no great harm done
never mind the pieces now benson you can clear them away afterwards glad to be released benson expeditiously set out the dessert and withdrew
what could you mean helen by taking the servants part against me said arthur as soon as the door was closed when you knew i was distracted i did not know you were distracted arthur and the poor man was quite frightened and hurt at your sudden explosion poor man indeed
and do you think i could stop to consider the feelings of an insensate brute like that when my own nerves were racked and torn to pieces by his confounded blunders i never heard you complain of your nerves before and why shouldnt i have nerves as well as you oh i dont dispute your claim to their possession but i never complain of mine no how should you when you never do anything to try them then why do you try yours arthur do you think i have nothing to do but to stay at home and take care of myself like a woman is it impossible then to take care of yourself like a man when you go abroad
you told me that you could and would too and you promised come come helen dont begin with that nonsense now i cant bear it cant bear whatto be reminded of the promises you have broken helen you are cruel
if you knew how my heart throbbed and how every nerve thrilled through me while you spoke you would spare me
you can pity a dolt of a servant for breaking a dish but you have no compassion for me when my head is split in two and all on fire with this consuming fever he leant his head on his hand and sighed
i went to him and put my hand on his forehead
it was burning indeed
then come with me into the drawingroom arthur and dont take any more wine you have taken several glasses since dinner and eaten next to nothing all the day
how can that make you better with some coaxing and persuasion i got him to leave the table
when the baby was brought i tried to amuse him with that but poor little arthur was cutting his teeth and his father could not bear his complaints sentence of immediate banishment was passed upon him on the first indication of fretfulness and because in the course of the evening i went to share his exile for a little while i was reproached on my return for preferring my child to my husband
i found the latter reclining on the sofa just as i had left him
well exclaimed the injured man in a tone of pseudoresignation
i thought i wouldnt send for you i thought id just see how long it would please you to leave me alone i have not been very long have i arthur
i have not been an hour im sure oh of course an hour is nothing to you so pleasantly employed but to me it has not been pleasantly employed interrupted i
i have been nursing our poor little baby who is very far from well and i could not leave him till i got him to sleep oh to be sure youre overflowing with kindness and pity for everything but me and why should i pity you what is the matter with you well
that passes everything
after all the wear and tear that ive had when i come home sick and weary longing for comfort and expecting to find attention and kindness at least from my wife she calmly asks what is the matter with me there is nothing the matter with you returned i except what you have wilfully brought upon yourself against my earnest exhortation and entreaty now helen said he emphatically half rising from his recumbent posture if you bother me with another word ill ring the bell and order six bottles of wine and by heaven ill drink them dry before i stir from this place i said no more but sat down before the table and drew a book towards me
do let me have quietness at least continued he if you deny me every other comfort and sinking back into his former position with an impatient expiration between a sigh and a groan he languidly closed his eyes as if to sleep
what the book was that lay open on the table before me i cannot tell for i never looked at it
with an elbow on each side of it and my hands clasped before my eyes i delivered myself up to silent weeping
but arthur was not asleep at the first slight sob he raised his head and looked round impatiently exclaiming what are you crying for helen
what the deuce is the matter now im crying for you arthur i replied speedily drying my tears and starting up i threw myself on my knees before him and clasping his nerveless hand between my own continued dont you know that you are a part of myself
and do you think you can injure and degrade yourself and i not feel it degrade myself helen yes degrade
what have you been doing all this time youd better not ask said he with a faint smile
and you had better not tell but you cannot deny that you have degraded yourself miserably
you have shamefully wronged yourself body and soul and me too and i cant endure it quietly and i wont well dont squeeze my hand so frantically and dont agitate me so for heavens sake
oh hattersley
you were right this woman will be the death of me with her keen feelings and her interesting force of character
there there do spare me a little arthur you must repent cried i in a frenzy of desperation throwing my arms around him and burying my face in his bosom
you shall say you are sorry for what you have done well well i am you are not
youll do it again i shall never live to do it again if you treat me so savagely replied he pushing me from him
youve nearly squeezed the breath out of my body he pressed his hand to his heart and looked really agitated and ill now get me a glass of wine said he to remedy what youve done you she tiger
im almost ready to faint i flew to get the required remedy
it seemed to revive him considerably
what a shame it is said i as i took the empty glass from his hand for a strong young man like you to reduce yourself to such a state if you knew all my girl youd say rather what a wonder it is you can bear it so well as you do ive lived more in these four months helen than you have in the whole course of your existence or will to the end of your days if they numbered a hundred years so i must expect to pay for it in some shape you will have to pay a higher price than you anticipate if you dont take care there will be the total loss of your own health and of my affection too if that is of any value to you what
youre at that game of threatening me with the loss of your affection again are you
i think it couldnt have been very genuine stuff to begin with if its so easily demolished
if you dont mind my pretty tyrant youll make me regret my choice in good earnest and envy my friend hattersley his meek little wife shes quite a pattern to her sex helen
he had her with him in london all the season and she was no trouble at all
he might amuse himself just as he pleased in regular bachelor style and she never complained of neglect he might come home at any hour of the night or morning or not come home at all be sullen sober or glorious drunk and play the fool or the madman to his own hearts desire without any fear or botheration
she never gives him a word of reproach or complaint do what he will
he says theres not such a jewel in all england and swears he wouldnt take a kingdom for her but he makes her life a curse to her not he
she has no will but his and is always contented and happy as long as he is enjoying himself in that case she is as great a fool as he is but it is not so
i have several letters from her expressing the greatest anxiety about his proceedings and complaining that you incite him to commit those extravagancesone especially in which she implores me to use my influence with you to get you away from london and affirms that her husband never did such things before you came and would certainly discontinue them as soon as you departed and left him to the guidance of his own good sense the detestable little traitor
give me the letter and he shall see it as sure as im a living man no he shall not see it without her consent but if he did there is nothing there to anger him nor in any of the others
she never speaks a word against him it is only anxiety for him that she expresses
she only alludes to his conduct in the most delicate terms and makes every excuse for him that she can possibly think of and as for her own misery i rather feel it than see it expressed in her letters but she abuses me and no doubt you helped her no i told her she overrated my influence with you that i would gladly draw you away from the temptations of the town if i could but had little hope of success and that i thought she was wrong in supposing that you enticed mr hattersley or any one else into error
i had myself held the contrary opinion at one time but i now believed that you mutually corrupted each other and perhaps if she used a little gentle but serious remonstrance with her husband it might be of some service as though he was more roughhewn than mine i believed he was of a less impenetrable material and so that is the way you go onheartening each other up to mutiny and abusing each others partners and throwing out implications against your own to the mutual gratification of both according to your own account said i my evil counsel has had but little effect upon her
and as to abuse and aspersions we are both of us far too deeply ashamed of the errors and vices of our other halves to make them the common subject of our correspondence
friends as we are we would willingly keep your failings to ourselveseven from ourselves if we could unless by knowing them we could deliver you from them well well
dont worry me about them youll never effect any good by that
have patience with me and bear with my languor and crossness a little while till i get this cursed low fever out of my veins and then youll find me cheerful and kind as ever
why cant you be gentle and good as you were last timeim sure i was very grateful for it and what good did your gratitude do
i deluded myself with the idea that you were ashamed of your transgressions and hoped you would never repeat them again but now you have left me nothing to hope my case is quite desperate is it
a very blessed consideration if it will only secure me from the pain and worry of my dear anxious wifes efforts to convert me and her from the toil and trouble of such exertions and her sweet face and silver accents from the ruinous effects of the same
a burst of passion is a fine rousing thing upon occasion helen and a flood of tears is marvellously affecting but when indulged too often they are both deuced plaguy things for spoiling ones beauty and tiring out ones friends thenceforth i restrained my tears and passions as much as i could
i spared him my exhortations and fruitless efforts at conversion too for i saw it was all in vain god might awaken that heart supine and stupefied with selfindulgence and remove the film of sensual darkness from his eyes but i could not
his injustice and illhumour towards his inferiors who could not defend themselves i still resented and withstood but when i alone was their object as was frequently the case i endured it with calm forbearance except at times when my temper worn out by repeated annoyances or stung to distraction by some new instance of irrationality gave way in spite of myself and exposed me to the imputations of fierceness cruelty and impatience
i attended carefully to his wants and amusements but not i own with the same devoted fondness as before because i could not feel it besides i had now another claimant on my time and caremy ailing infant for whose sake i frequently braved and suffered the reproaches and complaints of his unreasonably exacting father
but arthur is not naturally a peevish or irritable man so far from it that there was something almost ludicrous in the incongruity of this adventitious fretfulness and nervous irritability rather calculated to excite laughter than anger if it were not for the intensely painful considerations attendant upon those symptoms of a disordered frame and his temper gradually improved as his bodily health was restored which was much sooner than would have been the case but for my strenuous exertions for there was still one thing about him that i did not give up in despair and one effort for his preservation that i would not remit
his appetite for the stimulus of wine had increased upon him as i had too well foreseen
it was now something more to him than an accessory to social enjoyment it was an important source of enjoyment in itself
in this time of weakness and depression he would have made it his medicine and support his comforter his recreation and his friend and thereby sunk deeper and deeper and bound himself down for ever in the bathos whereinto he had fallen
but i determined this should never be as long as i had any influence left and though i could not prevent him from taking more than was good for him still by incessant perseverance by kindness and firmness and vigilance by coaxing and daring and determination i succeeded in preserving him from absolute bondage to that detestable propensity so insidious in its advances so inexorable in its tyranny so disastrous in its effects
and here i must not forget that i am not a little indebted to his friend mr hargrave
about that time he frequently called at grassdale and often dined with us on which occasions i fear arthur would willingly have cast prudence and decorum to the winds and made a night of it as often as his friend would have consented to join him in that exalted pastime and if the latter had chosen to comply he might in a night or two have ruined the labour of weeks and overthrown with a touch the frail bulwark it had cost me such trouble and toil to construct
i was so fearful of this at first that i humbled myself to intimate to him in private my apprehensions of arthurs proneness to these excesses and to express a hope that he would not encourage it
he was pleased with this mark of confidence and certainly did not betray it
on that and every subsequent occasion his presence served rather as a check upon his host than an incitement to further acts of intemperance and he always succeeded in bringing him from the diningroom in good time and in tolerably good condition for if arthur disregarded such intimations as well i must not detain you from your lady or we must not forget that mrs huntingdon is alone he would insist upon leaving the table himself to join me and his host however unwillingly was obliged to follow
hence i learned to welcome mr hargrave as a real friend to the family a harmless companion for arthur to cheer his spirits and preserve him from the tedium of absolute idleness and a total isolation from all society but mine and a useful ally to me
i could not but feel grateful to him under such circumstances and i did not scruple to acknowledge my obligation on the first convenient opportunity yet as i did so my heart whispered all was not right and brought a glow to my face which he heightened by his steady serious gaze while by his manner of receiving those acknowledgments he more than doubled my misgivings
his high delight at being able to serve me was chastened by sympathy for me and commiseration for himselfabout i know not what for i would not stay to inquire or suffer him to unburden his sorrows to me
his sighs and intimations of suppressed affliction seemed to come from a full heart but either he must contrive to retain them within it or breathe them forth in other ears than mine there was enough of confidence between us already
it seemed wrong that there should exist a secret understanding between my husbands friend and me unknown to him of which he was the object
but my afterthought was if it is wrong surely arthurs is the fault not mine and indeed i know not whether at the time it was not for him rather than myself that i blushed for since he and i are one i so identify myself with him that i feel his degradation his failings and transgressions as my own i blush for him i fear for him i repent for him weep pray and feel for him as for myself but i cannot act for him and hence i must be and i am debased contaminated by the union both in my own eyes and in the actual truth
i am so determined to love him so intensely anxious to excuse his errors that i am continually dwelling upon them and labouring to extenuate the loosest of his principles and the worst of his practices till i am familiarised with vice and almost a partaker in his sins
things that formerly shocked and disgusted me now seem only natural
i know them to be wrong because reason and gods word declare them to be so but i am gradually losing that instinctive horror and repulsion which were given me by nature or instilled into me by the precepts and example of my aunt
perhaps then i was too severe in my judgments for i abhorred the sinner as well as the sin now i flatter myself i am more charitable and considerate but am i not becoming more indifferent and insensate too
fool that i was to dream that i had strength and purity enough to save myself and him
such vain presumption would be rightly served if i should perish with him in the gulf from which i sought to save him
yet god preserve me from it and him too
yes poor arthur i will still hope and pray for you and though i write as if you were some abandoned wretch past hope and past reprieve it is only my anxious fears my strong desires that make me do so one who loved you less would be less bitter less dissatisfied
his conduct has of late been what the world calls irreproachable but then i know his heart is still unchanged and i know that spring is approaching and deeply dread the consequences
as he began to recover the tone and vigour of his exhausted frame and with it something of his former impatience of retirement and repose i suggested a short residence by the seaside for his recreation and further restoration and for the benefit of our little one as well
but no wateringplaces were so intolerably dull besides he had been invited by one of his friends to spend a month or two in scotland for the better recreation of grouseshooting and deerstalking and had promised to go
then you will leave me again arthur said i
yes dearest but only to love you the better when i come back and make up for all past offences and shortcomings and you neednt fear me this time there are no temptations on the mountains
and during my absence you may pay a visit to staningley if you like your uncle and aunt have long been wanting us to go there you know but somehow theres such a repulsion between the good lady and me that i never could bring myself up to the scratch about the third week in august arthur set out for scotland and mr hargrave accompanied him thither to my private satisfaction
shortly after i with little arthur and rachel went to staningley my dear old home which as well as my dear old friends its inhabitants i saw again with mingled feelings of pleasure and pain so intimately blended that i could scarcely distinguish the one from the other or tell to which to attribute the various tears and smiles and sighs awakened by those old familiar scenes and tones and faces
arthur did not come home till several weeks after my return to grassdale but i did not feel so anxious about him now to think of him engaged in active sports among the wild hills of scotland was very different from knowing him to be immersed amid the corruptions and temptations of london
his letters now though neither long nor loverlike were more regular than ever they had been before and when he did return to my great joy instead of being worse than when he went he was more cheerful and vigorous and better in every respect
since that time i have had little cause to complain
he still has an unfortunate predilection for the pleasures of the table against which i have to struggle and watch but he has begun to notice his boy and that is an increasing source of amusement to him withindoors while his foxhunting and coursing are a sufficient occupation for him without when the ground is not hardened by frost so that he is not wholly dependent on me for entertainment
but it is now january spring is approaching and i repeat i dread the consequences of its arrival
that sweet season i once so joyously welcomed as the time of hope and gladness awakens now far other anticipations by its return
march th
the dreaded time is come and arthur is gone as i expected
this time he announced it his intention to make but a short stay in london and pass over to the continent where he should probably stay a few weeks but i shall not expect him till after the lapse of many weeks i now know that with him days signify weeks and weeks months
july thhe returned about three weeks ago rather better in health certainly than before but still worse in temper
and yet perhaps i am wrong it is i that am less patient and forbearing
i am tired out with his injustice his selfishness and hopeless depravity
i wish a milder word would do i am no angel and my corruption rises against it
my poor father died last week arthur was vexed to hear of it because he saw that i was shocked and grieved and he feared the circumstance would mar his comfort
when i spoke of ordering my mourning he exclaimed oh i hate black
but however i suppose you must wear it awhile for forms sake but i hope helen you wont think it your bounden duty to compose your face and manners into conformity with your funereal garb
why should you sigh and groan and i be made uncomfortable because an old gentleman in shire a perfect stranger to us both has thought proper to drink himself to death
there now i declare youre crying
well it must be affectation he would not hear of my attending the funeral or going for a day or two to cheer poor fredericks solitude
it was quite unnecessary he said and i was unreasonable to wish it
what was my father to me
i had never seen him but once since i was a baby and i well knew he had never cared a stiver about me and my brother too was little better than a stranger
besides dear helen said he embracing me with flattering fondness i cannot spare you for a single day then how have you managed without me these many days said i
ah
then i was knocking about the world now i am at home and home without you my household deity would be intolerable yes as long as i am necessary to your comfort but you did not say so before when you urged me to leave you in order that you might get away from your home without me retorted i but before the words were well out of my mouth i regretted having uttered them
it seemed so heavy a charge if false too gross an insult if true too humiliating a fact to be thus openly cast in his teeth
but i might have spared myself that momentary pang of selfreproach
the accusation awoke neither shame nor indignation in him he attempted neither denial nor excuse but only answered with a long low chuckling laugh as if he viewed the whole transaction as a clever merry jest from beginning to end
surely that man will make me dislike him at last
sine as ye brew my maiden fair keep mind that ye maun drink the yill
yes and i will drink it to the very dregs and none but myself shall know how bitter i find it
august thwe are shaken down again to about our usual position
arthur has returned to nearly his former condition and habits and i have found it my wisest plan to shut my eyes against the past and future as far as he at least is concerned and live only for the present to love him when i can to smile if possible when he smiles be cheerful when he is cheerful and pleased when he is agreeable and when he is not to try to make him so and if that wont answer to bear with him to excuse him and forgive him as well as i can and restrain my own evil passions from aggravating his and yet while i thus yield and minister to his more harmless propensities to selfindulgence to do all in my power to save him from the worse
but we shall not be long alone together
i shall shortly be called upon to entertain the same select body of friends as we had the autumn before last with the addition of mr hattersley and at my special request his wife and child
i long to see milicent and her little girl too
the latter is now above a year old she will be a charming playmate for my little arthur
september thour guests have been here a week or two but i have had no leisure to pass any comments upon them till now
i cannot get over my dislike to lady lowborough
it is not founded on mere personal pique it is the woman herself that i dislike because i so thoroughly disapprove of her
i always avoid her company as much as i can without violating the laws of hospitality but when we do speak or converse together it is with the utmost civility even apparent cordiality on her part but preserve me from such cordiality
it is like handling brierroses and mayblossoms bright enough to the eye and outwardly soft to the touch but you know there are thorns beneath and every now and then you feel them too and perhaps resent the injury by crushing them in till you have destroyed their power though somewhat to the detriment of your own fingers
of late however i have seen nothing in her conduct towards arthur to anger or alarm me
during the first few days i thought she seemed very solicitous to win his admiration
her efforts were not unnoticed by him i frequently saw him smiling to himself at her artful manuvres but to his praise be it spoken her shafts fell powerless by his side
her most bewitching smiles her haughtiest frowns were ever received with the same immutable careless goodhumour till finding he was indeed impenetrable she suddenly remitted her efforts and became to all appearance as perfectly indifferent as himself
nor have i since witnessed any symptom of pique on his part or renewed attempts at conquest upon hers
this is as it should be but arthur never will let me be satisfied with him
i have never for a single hour since i married him known what it is to realise that sweet idea in quietness and confidence shall be your rest those two detestable men grimsby and hattersley have destroyed all my labour against his love of wine
they encourage him daily to overstep the bounds of moderation and not unfrequently to disgrace himself by positive excess
i shall not soon forget the second night after their arrival
just as i had retired from the diningroom with the ladies before the door was closed upon us arthur exclaimednow then my lads what say you to a regular jollification milicent glanced at me with a halfreproachful look as if i could hinder it but her countenance changed when she heard hattersleys voice shouting through door and wall im your man
send for more wine here isnt half enough we had scarcely entered the drawingroom before we were joined by lord lowborough
what can induce you to come so soon exclaimed his lady with a most ungracious air of dissatisfaction
you know i never drink annabella replied he seriously
well but you might stay with them a little it looks so silly to be always dangling after the women i wonder you can he reproached her with a look of mingled bitterness and surprise and sinking into a chair suppressed a heavy sigh bit his pale lips and fixed his eyes upon the floor
you did right to leave them lord lowborough said i
i trust you will always continue to honour us so early with your company
and if annabella knew the value of true wisdom and the misery of folly andand intemperance she would not talk such nonsenseeven in jest he raised his eyes while i spoke and gravely turned them upon me with a halfsurprised halfabstracted look and then bent them on his wife
at least said she i know the value of a warm heart and a bold manly spirit well annabella said he in a deep and hollow tone since my presence is disagreeable to you i will relieve you of it are you going back to them then said she carelessly
no exclaimed he with harsh and startling emphasis
i will not go back to them
and i will never stay with them one moment longer than i think right for you or any other tempter
but you neednt mind that i shall never trouble you again by intruding my company upon you so unseasonably he left the room i heard the halldoor open and shut and immediately after on putting aside the curtain i saw him pacing down the park in the comfortless gloom of the damp cloudy twilight
it would serve you right annabella said i at length if lord lowborough were to return to his old habits which had so nearly effected his ruin and which it cost him such an effort to break you would then see cause to repent such conduct as this not at all my dear
i should not mind if his lordship were to see fit to intoxicate himself every day i should only the sooner be rid of him oh annabella cried milicent
how can you say such wicked things
it would indeed be a just punishment as far as you are concerned if providence should take you at your word and make you feel what others feel that she paused as a sudden burst of loud talking and laughter reached us from the diningroom in which the voice of hattersley was preeminently conspicuous even to my unpractised ear
what you feel at this moment i suppose said lady lowborough with a malicious smile fixing her eyes upon her cousins distressed countenance
the latter offered no reply but averted her face and brushed away a tear
at that moment the door opened and admitted mr hargrave just a little flushed his dark eyes sparkling with unwonted vivacity
oh im so glad youre come walter cried his sister
but i wish you could have got ralph to come too utterly impossible dear milicent replied he gaily
i had much ado to get away myself
ralph attempted to keep me by violence huntingdon threatened me with the eternal loss of his friendship and grimsby worse than all endeavoured to make me ashamed of my virtue by such galling sarcasms and innuendoes as he knew would wound me the most
so you see ladies you ought to make me welcome when i have braved and suffered so much for the favour of your sweet society he smilingly turned to me and bowed as he finished the sentence
isnt he handsome now helen whispered milicent her sisterly pride overcoming for the moment all other considerations
he would be i returned if that brilliance of eye and lip and cheek were natural to him but look again a few hours hence here the gentleman took a seat near me at the table and petitioned for a cup of coffee
i consider this an apt illustration of heaven taken by storm said he as i handed one to him
i am in paradise now but i have fought my way through flood and fire to win it
ralph hattersleys last resource was to set his back against the door and swear i should find no passage but through his body a pretty substantial one too
happily however that was not the only door and i effected my escape by the side entrance through the butlers pantry to the infinite amazement of benson who was cleaning the plate mr hargrave laughed and so did his cousin but his sister and i remained silent and grave
pardon my levity mrs huntingdon murmured he more seriously as he raised his eyes to my face
you are not used to these things you suffer them to affect your delicate mind too sensibly
but i thought of you in the midst of those lawless roysterers and i endeavoured to persuade mr huntingdon to think of you too but to no purpose i fear he is fully determined to enjoy himself this night and it will be no use keeping the coffee waiting for him or his companions it will be much if they join us at tea
meantime i earnestly wish i could banish the thoughts of them from your mindand my own too for i hate to think of themyeseven of my dear friend huntingdon when i consider the power he possesses over the happiness of one so immeasurably superior to himself and the use he makes of iti positively detest the man you had better not say so to me then said i for bad as he is he is part of myself and you cannot abuse him without offending me pardon me then for i would sooner die than offend you
but let us say no more of him for the present if you please at last they came but not till after ten when tea which had been delayed for more than half an hour was nearly over
much as i had longed for their coming my heart failed me at the riotous uproar of their approach and milicent turned pale and almost started from her seat as mr hattersley burst into the room with a clamorous volley of oaths in his mouth which hargrave endeavoured to check by entreating him to remember the ladies
ah
you do well to remind me of the ladies you dastardly deserter cried he shaking his formidable fist at his brotherinlaw
if it were not for them you well know id demolish you in the twinkling of an eye and give your body to the fowls of heaven and the lilies of the fields then planting a chair by lady lowboroughs side he stationed himself in it and began to talk to her with a mixture of absurdity and impudence that seemed rather to amuse than to offend her though she affected to resent his insolence and to keep him at bay with sallies of smart and spirited repartee
meantime mr grimsby seated himself by me in the chair vacated by hargrave as they entered and gravely stated that he would thank me for a cup of tea and arthur placed himself beside poor milicent confidentially pushing his head into her face and drawing in closer to her as she shrank away from him
he was not so noisy as hattersley but his face was exceedingly flushed he laughed incessantly and while i blushed for all i saw and heard of him i was glad that he chose to talk to his companion in so low a tone that no one could hear what he said but herself
what fools they are drawled mr grimsby who had been talking away at my elbow with sententious gravity all the time but i had been too much absorbed in contemplating the deplorable state of the other twoespecially arthurto attend to him
did you ever hear such nonsense as they talk mrs huntingdon he continued
im quite ashamed of them for my part they cant take so much as a bottle between them without its getting into their heads you are pouring the cream into your saucer mr grimsby ah
yes i see but were almost in darkness here
hargrave snuff those candles will you theyre wax they dont require snuffing said i
the light of the body is the eye observed hargrave with a sarcastic smile
if thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light grimsby repulsed him with a solemn wave of the hand and then turning to me continued with the same drawling tones and strange uncertainty of utterance and heavy gravity of aspect as before but as i was saying mrs huntingdon they have no head at all they cant take half a bottle without being affected some way whereas iwell ive taken three times as much as they have tonight and you see im perfectly steady
now that may strike you as very singular but i think i can explain it you see their brainsi mention no names but youll understand to whom i alludetheir brains are light to begin with and the fumes of the fermented liquor render them lighter still and produce an entire lightheadedness or giddiness resulting in intoxication whereas my brains being composed of more solid materials will absorb a considerable quantity of this alcoholic vapour without the production of any sensible result i think you will find a sensible result produced on that tea interrupted mr hargrave by the quantity of sugar you have put into it
instead of your usual complement of one lump you have put in six have i so replied the philosopher diving with his spoon into the cup and bringing up several halfdissolved pieces in confirmation of the assertion
hum
i perceive
thus madam you see the evil of absence of mindof thinking too much while engaged in the common concerns of life
now if i had had my wits about me like ordinary men instead of within me like a philosopher i should not have spoiled this cup of tea and been constrained to trouble you for another that is the sugarbasin mr grimsby
now you have spoiled the sugar too and ill thank you to ring for some more for here is lord lowborough at last and i hope his lordship will condescend to sit down with us such as we are and allow me to give him some tea his lordship gravely bowed in answer to my appeal but said nothing
meantime hargrave volunteered to ring for the sugar while grimsby lamented his mistake and attempted to prove that it was owing to the shadow of the urn and the badness of the lights
lord lowborough had entered a minute or two before unobserved by anyone but me and had been standing before the door grimly surveying the company
he now stepped up to annabella who sat with her back towards him with hattersley still beside her though not now attending to her being occupied in vociferously abusing and bullying his host
well annabella said her husband as he leant over the back of her chair which of these three bold manly spirits would you have me to resemble by heaven and earth you shall resemble us all cried hattersley starting up and rudely seizing him by the arm
hallo huntingdon he shoutedive got him
come man and help me
and dn me if i dont make him drunk before i let him go
he shall make up for all past delinquencies as sure as im a living soul there followed a disgraceful contest lord lowborough in desperate earnest and pale with anger silently struggling to release himself from the powerful madman that was striving to drag him from the room
i attempted to urge arthur to interfere in behalf of his outraged guest but he could do nothing but laugh
huntingdon you fool come and help me cant you cried hattersley himself somewhat weakened by his excesses
im wishing you godspeed hattersley cried arthur and aiding you with my prayers i cant do anything else if my life depended on it
im quite used up
ohoh and leaning back in his seat he clapped his hands on his sides and groaned aloud
annabella give me a candle said lowborough whose antagonist had now got him round the waist and was endeavouring to root him from the doorpost to which he madly clung with all the energy of desperation
i shall take no part in your rude sports replied the lady coldly drawing back
i wonder you can expect it but i snatched up a candle and brought it to him
he took it and held the flame to hattersleys hands till roaring like a wild beast the latter unclasped them and let him go
he vanished i suppose to his own apartment for nothing more was seen of him till the morning
swearing and cursing like a maniac hattersley threw himself on to the ottoman beside the window
the door being now free milicent attempted to make her escape from the scene of her husbands disgrace but he called her back and insisted upon her coming to him
what do you want ralph murmured she reluctantly approaching him
i want to know whats the matter with you said he pulling her on to his knee like a child
what are you crying for milicenttell me im not crying you are persisted he rudely pulling her hands from her face
how dare you tell such a lie im not crying now pleaded she
but you have been and just this minute too and i will know what for
come now you shall tell me do let me alone ralph
remember we are not at home no matter you shall answer my question exclaimed her tormentor and he attempted to extort the confession by shaking her and remorselessly crushing her slight arms in the gripe of his powerful fingers
dont let him treat your sister in that way said i to mr hargrave
come now hattersley i cant allow that said that gentleman stepping up to the illassorted couple
let my sister alone if you please and he made an effort to unclasp the ruffians fingers from her arm but was suddenly driven backward and nearly laid upon the floor by a violent blow on the chest accompanied with the admonition take that for your insolence
and learn to interfere between me and mine again if you were not drunk id have satisfaction for that gasped hargrave white and breathless as much from passion as from the immediate effects of the blow
go to the devil responded his brotherinlaw
now milicent tell me what you were crying for ill tell you some other time murmured she when we are alone tell me now said he with another shake and a squeeze that made her draw in her breath and bite her lip to suppress a cry of pain
ill tell you mr hattersley said i
she was crying from pure shame and humiliation for you because she could not bear to see you conduct yourself so disgracefully confound you madam muttered he with a stare of stupid amazement at my impudence it was not thatwas it milicent she was silent
come speak up child i cant tell now sobbed she
but you can say yes or no as well as i cant tellcome yes she whispered hanging her head and blushing at the awful acknowledgment
curse you for an impertinent hussy then cried he throwing her from him with such violence that she fell on her side but she was up again before either i or her brother could come to her assistance and made the best of her way out of the room and i suppose upstairs without loss of time
the next object of assault was arthur who sat opposite and had no doubt richly enjoyed the whole scene
now huntingdon exclaimed his irascible friend i will not have you sitting there and laughing like an idiot oh hattersley cried he wiping his swimming eyesyoull be the death of me yes i will but not as you suppose ill have the heart out of your body man if you irritate me with any more of that imbecile laughterwhat
are you at it yetthere
see if thatll settle you cried hattersley snatching up a footstool and hurting it at the head of his host but he as well as missed his aim and the latter still sat collapsed and quaking with feeble laughter with tears running down his face a deplorable spectacle indeed
hattersley tried cursing and swearing but it would not do he then took a number of books from the table beside him and threw them one by one at the object of his wrath but arthur only laughed the more and finally hattersley rushed upon him in a frenzy and seizing him by the shoulders gave him a violent shaking under which he laughed and shrieked alarmingly
but i saw no more i thought i had witnessed enough of my husbands degradation and leaving annabella and the rest to follow when they pleased i withdrew but not to bed
dismissing rachel to her rest i walked up and down my room in an agony of misery for what had been done and suspense not knowing what might further happen or how or when that unhappy creature would come up to bed
at last he came slowly and stumblingly ascending the stairs supported by grimsby and hattersley who neither of them walked quite steadily themselves but were both laughing and joking at him and making noise enough for all the servants to hear
he himself was no longer laughing now but sick and stupid
i will write no more about that
such disgraceful scenes or nearly such have been repeated more than once
i dont say much to arthur about it for if i did it would do more harm than good but i let him know that i intensely dislike such exhibitions and each time he has promised they should never again be repeated
but i fear he is losing the little selfcommand and selfrespect he once possessed formerly he would have been ashamed to act thusat least before any other witnesses than his boon companions or such as they
his friend hargrave with a prudence and selfgovernment that i envy for him never disgraces himself by taking more than sufficient to render him a little elevated and is always the first to leave the table after lord lowborough who wiser still perseveres in vacating the diningroom immediately after us but never once since annabella offended him so deeply has he entered the drawingroom before the rest always spending the interim in the library which i take care to have lighted for his accommodation or on fine moonlight nights in roaming about the grounds
but i think she regrets her misconduct for she has never repeated it since and of late she has comported herself with wonderful propriety towards him treating him with more uniform kindness and consideration than ever i have observed her to do before
i date the time of this improvement from the period when she ceased to hope and strive for arthurs admiration
october thesther hargrave is getting a fine girl
she is not out of the schoolroom yet but her mother frequently brings her over to call in the mornings when the gentlemen are out and sometimes she spends an hour or two in company with her sister and me and the children and when we go to the grove i always contrive to see her and talk more to her than to any one else for i am very much attached to my little friend and so is she to me
i wonder what she can see to like in me though for i am no longer the happy lively girl i used to be but she has no other society save that of her uncongenial mother and her governess as artificial and conventional a person as that prudent mother could procure to rectify the pupils natural qualities and now and then her subdued quiet sister
i often wonder what will be her lot in life and so does she but her speculations on the future are full of buoyant hope so were mine once
i shudder to think of her being awakened like me to a sense of their delusive vanity
it seems as if i should feel her disappointment even more deeply than my own
i feel almost as if i were born for such a fate but she is so joyous and fresh so light of heart and free of spirit and so guileless and unsuspecting too
oh it would be cruel to make her feel as i feel now and know what i have known
her sister trembles for her too
yesterday morning one of octobers brightest loveliest days milicent and i were in the garden enjoying a brief halfhour together with our children while annabella was lying on the drawingroom sofa deep in the last new novel
we had been romping with the little creatures almost as merry and wild as themselves and now paused in the shade of the tall copper beech to recover breath and rectify our hair disordered by the rough play and the frolicsome breeze while they toddled together along the broad sunny walk my arthur supporting the feebler steps of her little helen and sagaciously pointing out to her the brightest beauties of the border as they passed with semiarticulate prattle that did as well for her as any other mode of discourse
from laughing at the pretty sight we began to talk of the childrens future life and that made us thoughtful
we both relapsed into silent musing as we slowly proceeded up the walk and i suppose milicent by a train of associations was led to think of her sister
helen said she you often see esther dont you not very often but you have more frequent opportunities of meeting her than i have and she loves you i know and reverences you too there is nobodys opinion she thinks so much of and she says you have more sense than mamma that is because she is selfwilled and my opinions more generally coincide with her own than your mammas
but what then milicent well since you have so much influence with her i wish you would seriously impress it upon her never on any account or for anybodys persuasion to marry for the sake of money or rank or establishment or any earthly thing but true affection and wellgrounded esteem there is no necessity for that said i for we have had some discourse on that subject already and i assure you her ideas of love and matrimony are as romantic as any one could desire but romantic notions will not do i want her to have true notions very right but in my judgment what the world stigmatises as romantic is often more nearly allied to the truth than is commonly supposed for if the generous ideas of youth are too often overclouded by the sordid views of afterlife that scarcely proves them to be false well but if you think her ideas are what they ought to be strengthen them will you
and confirm them as far as you can for i had romantic notions once andi dont mean to say that i regret my lot for i am quite sure i dont but i understand you said i you are contented for yourself but you would not have your sister to suffer the same as you noor worse
she might have far worse to suffer than i for i am really contented helen though you maynt think it i speak the solemn truth in saying that i would not exchange my husband for any man on earth if i might do it by the plucking of this leaf well i believe you now that you have him you would not exchange him for another but then you would gladly exchange some of his qualities for those of better men yes just as i would gladly exchange some of my own qualities for those of better women for neither he nor i are perfect and i desire his improvement as earnestly as my own
and he will improve dont you think so helen
hes only sixandtwenty yet he may i answered he will he will repeated she
excuse the faintness of my acquiescence milicent i would not discourage your hopes for the world but mine have been so often disappointed that i am become as cold and doubtful in my expectations as the flattest of octogenarians and yet you do hope still even for mr huntingdon i do i confess even for him for it seems as if life and hope must cease together
and is he so much worse milicent than mr hattersley well to give you my candid opinion i think there is no comparison between them
but you mustnt be offended helen for you know i always speak my mind and you may speak yours too
i shant care i am not offended love and my opinion is that if there be a comparison made between the two the difference for the most part is certainly in hattersleys favour milicents own heart told her how much it cost me to make this acknowledgment and with a childlike impulse she expressed her sympathy by suddenly kissing my cheek without a word of reply and then turning quickly away caught up her baby and hid her face in its frock
how odd it is that we so often weep for each others distresses when we shed not a tear for our own
her heart had been full enough of her own sorrows but it overflowed at the idea of mine and i too shed tears at the sight of her sympathetic emotion though i had not wept for myself for many a week
illustration it was one rainy day last week most of the company were killing time in the billiardroom but milicent and i were with little arthur and helen in the library and between our books our children and each other we expected to make out a very agreeable morning
we had not been thus secluded above two hours however when mr hattersley came in attracted i suppose by the voice of his child as he was crossing the hall for he is prodigiously fond of her and she of him
he was redolent of the stables where he had been regaling himself with the company of his fellowcreatures the horses ever since breakfast
but that was no matter to my little namesake as soon as the colossal person of her father darkened the door she uttered a shrill scream of delight and quitting her mothers side ran crowing towards him balancing her course with outstretched arms and embracing his knee threw back her head and laughed in his face
he might well look smilingly down upon those small fair features radiant with innocent mirth those clear blue shining eyes and that soft flaxen hair cast back upon the little ivory neck and shoulders
did he not think how unworthy he was of such a possession
i fear no such idea crossed his mind
he caught her up and there followed some minutes of very rough play during which it is difficult to say whether the father or the daughter laughed and shouted the loudest
at length however the boisterous pastime terminated suddenly as might be expected the little one was hurt and began to cry and the ungentle playfellow tossed it into its mothers lap bidding her make all straight as happy to return to that gentle comforter as it had been to leave her the child nestled in her arms and hushed its cries in a moment and sinking its little weary head on her bosom soon dropped asleep
meantime mr hattersley strode up to the fire and interposing his height and breadth between us and it stood with arms akimbo expanding his chest and gazing round him as if the house and all its appurtenances and contents were his own undisputed possessions
deuced bad weather this he began
therell be no shooting today i guess then suddenly lifting up his voice he regaled us with a few bars of a rollicking song which abruptly ceasing he finished the tune with a whistle and then continuedi say mrs huntingdon what a fine stud your husband has
not large but good
ive been looking at them a bit this morning and upon my word black boss and grey tom and that young nimrod are the finest animals ive seen for many a day then followed a particular discussion of their various merits succeeded by a sketch of the great things he intended to do in the horsejockey line when his old governor thought proper to quit the stage
not that i wish him to close his accounts added he the old trojan is welcome to keep his books open as long as he pleases for me i hope so indeed mr hattersley oh yes
its only my way of talking
the event must come some time and so i look to the bright side of it thats the right planisnt it mrs h
what are you two doing here
bytheby wheres lady lowborough in the billiardroom what a splendid creature she is continued he fixing his eyes on his wife who changed colour and looked more and more disconcerted as he proceeded
what a noble figure she has and what magnificent black eyes and what a fine spirit of her own and what a tongue of her own too when she likes to use it
i perfectly adore her
but never mind milicent i wouldnt have her for my wife not if shed a kingdom for her dowry
im better satisfied with the one i have
now then what do you look so sulky for
dont you believe me yes i believe you murmured she in a tone of half sad half sullen resignation as she turned away to stroke the hair of her sleeping infant that she had laid on the sofa beside her
well then what makes you so cross
come here milly and tell me why you cant be satisfied with my assurance she went and putting her little hand within his arm looked up in his face and said softly what does it amount to ralph
only to this that though you admire annabella so much and for qualities that i dont possess you would still rather have me than her for your wife which merely proves that you dont think it necessary to love your wife you are satisfied if she can keep your house and take care of your child
but im not cross im only sorry for added she in a low tremulous accent withdrawing her hand from his arm and bending her looks on the rug if you dont love me you dont and it cant be helped very true but who told you i didnt
did i say i loved annabella you said you adored her true but adoration isnt love
i adore annabella but i dont love her and i love thee milicent but i dont adore thee in proof of his affection he clutched a handful of her light brown ringlets and appeared to twist them unmercifully
do you really ralph murmured she with a faint smile beaming through her tears just putting up her hand to his in token that he pulled rather too hard
to be sure i do responded he only you bother me rather sometimes i bother you cried she in very natural surprise
yes youbut only by your exceeding goodness
when a boy has been eating raisins and sugarplums all day he longs for a squeeze of sour orange by way of a change
and did you never milly observe the sands on the seashore how nice and smooth they look and how soft and easy they feel to the foot
but if you plod along for half an hour over this soft easy carpetgiving way at every step yielding the more the harder you pressyoull find it rather wearisome work and be glad enough to come to a bit of good firm rock that wont budge an inch whether you stand walk or stamp upon it and though it be hard as the nether millstone youll find it the easier footing after all i know what you mean ralph said she nervously playing with her watchguard and tracing the figure on the rug with the point of her tiny footi know what you mean but i thought you always liked to be yielded to and i cant alter now i do like it replied he bringing her to him by another tug at her hair
you mustnt mind my talk milly
a man must have something to grumble about and if he cant complain that his wife harries him to death with her perversity and illhumour he must complain that she wears him out with her kindness and gentleness but why complain at all unless because you are tired and dissatisfied to excuse my own failings to be sure
do you think ill bear all the burden of my sins on my own shoulders as long as theres another ready to help me with none of her own to carry there is no such one on earth said she seriously and then taking his hand from her head she kissed it with an air of genuine devotion and tripped away to the door
what now said he
where are you going to tidy my hair she answered smiling through her disordered locks youve made it all come down off with you thenan excellent little woman he remarked when she was gone but a thought too softshe almost melts in ones hands
i positively think i illuse her sometimes when ive taken too muchbut i cant help it for she never complains either at the time or after
i suppose she doesnt mind it i can enlighten you on that subject mr hattersley said i she does mind it and some other things she minds still more which yet you may never hear her complain of how do you knowdoes she complain to you demanded he with a sudden spark of fury ready to burst into a flame if i should answer yes no i replied but i have known her longer and studied her more closely than you have doneand i can tell you mr hattersley that milicent loves you more than you deserve and that you have it in your power to make her very happy instead of which you are her evil genius and i will venture to say there is not a single day passes in which you do not inflict upon her some pang that you might spare her if you would wellits not my fault said he gazing carelessly up at the ceiling and plunging his hands into his pockets if my ongoings dont suit her she should tell me so is she not exactly the wife you wanted
did you not tell mr huntingdon you must have one that would submit to anything without a murmur and never blame you whatever you did true but we shouldnt always have what we want it spoils the best of us doesnt it
how can i help playing the deuce when i see its all one to her whether i behave like a christian or like a scoundrel such as nature made me
and how can i help teasing her when shes so invitingly meek and mim when she lies down like a spaniel at my feet and never so much as squeaks to tell me thats enough if you are a tyrant by nature the temptation is strong i allow but no generous mind delights to oppress the weak but rather to cherish and protect i dont oppress her but its so confounded flat to be always cherishing and protecting and then how can i tell that i am oppressing her when she melts away and makes no sign
i sometimes think she has no feeling at all and then i go on till she cries and that satisfies me then you do delight to oppress her i dont i tell you
only when im in a bad humour or a particularly good one and want to afflict for the pleasure of comforting or when she looks flat and wants shaking up a bit
and sometimes she provokes me by crying for nothing and wont tell me what its for and then i allow it enrages me past bearing especially when im not my own man as is no doubt generally the case on such occasions said i
but in future mr hattersley when you see her looking flat or crying for nothing as you call it ascribe it all to yourself be assured it is something you have done amiss or your general misconduct that distresses her i dont believe it
if it were she should tell me so i dont like that way of moping and fretting in silence and saying nothing its not honest
how can she expect me to mend my ways at that rate perhaps she gives you credit for having more sense than you possess and deludes herself with the hope that you will one day see your own errors and repair them if left to your own reflection none of your sneers mrs huntingdon
i have the sense to see that im not always quite correct but sometimes i think thats no great matter as long as i injure nobody but myself it is a great matter interrupted i both to yourself as you will hereafter find to your cost and to all connected with you most especially your wife
but indeed it is nonsense to talk about injuring no one but yourself it is impossible to injure yourself especially by such acts as we allude to without injuring hundreds if not thousands besides in a greater or less degree either by the evil you do or the good you leave undone and as i was saying continued he or would have said if you hadnt taken me up so short i sometimes think i should do better if i were joined to one that would always remind me when i was wrong and give me a motive for doing good and eschewing evil by decidedly showing her approval of the one and disapproval of the other if you had no higher motive than the approval of your fellowmortal it would do you little good well but if i had a mate that would not always be yielding and always equally kind but that would have the spirit to stand at bay now and then and honestly tell me her mind at all times such a one as yourself for instance
now if i went on with you as i do with her when im in london youd make the house too hot to hold me at times ill be sworn you mistake me im no termagant well all the better for that for i cant stand contradiction in a general way and im as fond of my own will as another only i think too much of it doesnt answer for any man well i would never contradict you without a cause but certainly i would always let you know what i thought of your conduct and if you oppressed me in body mind or estate you should at least have no reason to suppose i didnt mind it i know that my lady and i think if my little wife were to follow the same plan it would be better for us both ill tell her no no let her be theres much to be said on both sides and now i think upon it huntingdon often regrets that you are not more like her scoundrelly dog that he is and you see after all you cant reform him hes ten times worse than i hes afraid of you to be sure that is hes always on his best behaviour in your presencebut i wonder what his worst behaviour is like then i could not forbear observing
why to tell you the truth its very bad indeedisnt it hargrave said he addressing that gentleman who had entered the room unperceived by me for i was now standing near the fire with my back to the door
isnt huntingdon he continued as great a reprobate as ever was dd his lady will not hear him censured with impunity replied mr hargrave coming forward but i must say i thank god i am not such another perhaps it would become you better said i to look at what you are and say god be merciful to me a sinner you are severe returned he bowing slightly and drawing himself up with a proud yet injured air
hattersley laughed and clapped him on the shoulder
moving from under his hand with a gesture of insulted dignity mr hargrave took himself away to the other end of the rug
isnt it a shame mrs huntingdon cried his brotherinlaw i struck walter hargrave when i was drunk the second night after we came and hes turned a cold shoulder on me ever since though i asked his pardon the very morning after it was done your manner of asking it returned the other and the clearness with which you remembered the whole transaction showed you were not too drunk to be fully conscious of what you were about and quite responsible for the deed you wanted to interfere between me and my wife grumbled hattersley and that is enough to provoke any man you justify it then said his opponent darting upon him a most vindictive glance
no i tell you i wouldnt have done it if i hadnt been under excitement and if you choose to bear malice for it after all the handsome things ive said do so and be dd i would refrain from such language in a ladys presence at least said mr hargrave hiding his anger under a mask of disgust
what have i said returned hattersley nothing but heavens truth
he will be damned wont he mrs huntingdon if he doesnt forgive his brothers trespasses you ought to forgive him mr hargrave since he asks you said i
do you say so
then i will and smiling almost frankly he stepped forward and offered his hand
it was immediately clasped in that of his relative and the reconciliation was apparently cordial on both sides
the affront continued hargrave turning to me owed half its bitterness to the fact of its being offered in your presence and since you bid me forgive it i will and forget it too i guess the best return i can make will be to take myself off muttered hattersley with a broad grin
his companion smiled and he left the room
this put me on my guard
mr hargrave turned seriously to me and earnestly began dear mrs huntingdon how i have longed for yet dreaded this hour
do not be alarmed he added for my face was crimson with anger i am not about to offend you with any useless entreaties or complaints
i am not going to presume to trouble you with the mention of my own feelings or your perfections but i have something to reveal to you which you ought to know and which yet it pains me inexpressibly then dont trouble yourself to reveal it but it is of importance if so i shall hear it soon enough especially if it is bad news as you seem to consider it
at present i am going to take the children to the nursery but cant you ring and send them no i want the exercise of a run to the top of the house
come arthur but you will return not yet dont wait then when may i see you again at lunch said i departing with little helen in one arm and leading arthur by the hand
he turned away muttering some sentence of impatient censure or complaint in which heartless was the only distinguishable word
what nonsense is this mr hargrave said i pausing in the doorway
what do you mean oh nothing i did not intend you should hear my soliloquy
but the fact is mrs huntingdon i have a disclosure to make painful for me to offer as for you to hear and i want you to give me a few minutes of your attention in private at any time and place you like to appoint
it is from no selfish motive that i ask it and not for any cause that could alarm your superhuman purity therefore you need not kill me with that look of cold and pitiless disdain
i know too well the feelings with which the bearers of bad tidings are commonly regarded not to what is this wonderful piece of intelligence said i impatiently interrupting him
if it is anything of real importance speak it in three words before i go in three words i cannot
send those children away and stay with me no keep your bad tidings to yourself
i know it is something i dont want to hear and something you would displease me by telling you have divined too truly i fear but still since i know it i feel it my duty to disclose it to you oh spare us both the infliction and i will exonerate you from the duty
you have offered to tell i have refused to hear my ignorance will not be charged on you be it so you shall not hear it from me
but if the blow fall too suddenly upon you when it comes remember i wished to soften it i left him
i was determined his words should not alarm me
what could he of all men have to reveal that was of importance for me to hear
it was no doubt some exaggerated tale about my unfortunate husband that he wished to make the most of to serve his own bad purposes
thhe has not alluded to this momentous mystery since and i have seen no reason to repent of my unwillingness to hear it
the threatened blow has not been struck yet and i do not greatly fear it
at present i am pleased with arthur he has not positively disgraced himself for upwards of a fortnight and all this last week has been so very moderate in his indulgence at table that i can perceive a marked difference in his general temper and appearance
dare i hope this will continue
seventhyes i will hope
tonight i heard grimsby and hattersley grumbling together about the inhospitality of their host
they did not know i was near for i happened to be standing behind the curtain in the bow of the window watching the moon rising over the clump of tall dark elmtrees below the lawn and wondering why arthur was so sentimental as to stand without leaning against the outer pillar of the portico apparently watching it too
so i suppose weve seen the last of our merry carousals in this house said mr hattersley i thought his goodfellowship wouldnt last long
but added he laughing i didnt expect it would meet its end this way
i rather thought our pretty hostess would be setting up her porcupine quills and threatening to turn us out of the house if we didnt mind our manners you didnt foresee this then answered grimsby with a guttural chuckle
but hell change again when hes sick of her
if we come here a year or two hence we shall have all our own way youll see i dont know replied the other shes not the style of woman you soon tire of
but be that as it may its devilish provoking now that we cant be jolly because he chooses to be on his good behaviour its all these cursed women muttered grimsby theyre the very bane of the world
they bring trouble and discomfort wherever they come with their false fair faces and their deceitful tongues at this juncture i issued from my retreat and smiling on mr grimsby as i passed left the room and went out in search of arthur
having seen him bend his course towards the shrubbery i followed him thither and found him just entering the shadowy walk
i was so light of heart so overflowing with affection that i sprang upon him and clasped him in my arms
this startling conduct had a singular effect upon him first he murmured bless you darling and returned my close embrace with a fervour like old times and then he started and in a tone of absolute terror exclaimed helen
what the devil is this and i saw by the faint light gleaming through the overshadowing tree that he was positively pale with the shock
how strange that the instinctive impulse of affection should come first and then the shock of the surprise
it shows at least that the affection is genuine he is not sick of me yet
i startled you arthur said i laughing in my glee
how nervous you are what the deuce did you do it for cried he quite testily extricating himself from my arms and wiping his forehead with his handkerchief
go back helengo back directly
youll get your death of cold i wont till ive told you what i came for
they are blaming you arthur for your temperance and sobriety and im come to thank you for it
they say it is all these cursed women and that we are the bane of the world but dont let them laugh or grumble you out of your good resolutions or your affection for me he laughed
i squeezed him in my arms again and cried in tearful earnest do do persevere
and ill love you better than ever i did before well well i will said he hastily kissing me
there now go
you mad creature how could you come out in your light evening dress this chill autumn night it is a glorious night said i
it is a night that will give you your death in another minute
run away do do you see my death among those trees arthur said i for he was gazing intently at the shrubs as if he saw it coming and i was reluctant to leave him in my newfound happiness and revival of hope and love
but he grew angry at my delay so i kissed him and ran back to the house
i was in such a good humour that night milicent told me i was the life of the party and whispered she had never seen me so brilliant
certainly i talked enough for twenty and smiled upon them all
grimsby hattersley hargrave lady lowborough all shared my sisterly kindness
grimsby stared and wondered hattersley laughed and jested in spite of the little wine he had been suffered to imbibe but still behaved as well as he knew how
hargrave and annabella from different motives and in different ways emulated me and doubtless both surpassed me the former in his discursive versatility and eloquence the latter in boldness and animation at least
milicent delighted to see her husband her brother and her overestimated friend acquitting themselves so well was lively and gay too in her quiet way
even lord lowborough caught the general contagion his dark greenish eyes were lighted up beneath their moody brows his sombre countenance was beautified by smiles all traces of gloom and proud or cold reserve had vanished for the time and he astonished us all not only by his general cheerfulness and animation but by the positive flashes of true force and brilliance he emitted from time to time
arthur did not talk much but he laughed and listened to the rest and was in perfect goodhumour though not excited by wine
so that altogether we made a very merry innocent and entertaining party
thyesterday when rachel came to dress me for dinner i saw that she had been crying
i wanted to know the cause of it but she seemed reluctant to tell
was she unwell
no
had she heard bad news from her friends
no
had any of the servants vexed her
oh no maam she answered its not for myself what then rachel
have you been reading novels bless you no said she with a sorrowful shake of the head and then she sighed and continued but to tell you the truth maam i dont like masters ways of going on what do you mean rachel
hes going on very properly at present well maam if you think so its right and she went on dressing my hair in a hurried way quite unlike her usual calm collected manner murmuring half to herself she was sure it was beautiful hair she could like to see em match it when it was done she fondly stroked it and gently patted my head
is that affectionate ebullition intended for my hair or myself nurse said i laughingly turning round upon her but a tear was even now in her eye
what do you mean rachel i exclaimed
well maam i dont know but if if what well if i was you i wouldnt have that lady lowborough in the house another minutenot another minute i wouldnt
i was thunderstruck but before i could recover from the shock sufficiently to demand an explanation milicent entered my room as she frequently does when she is dressed before me and she stayed with me till it was time to go down
she must have found me a very unsociable companion this time for rachels last words rang in my ears
but still i hoped i trusted they had no foundation but in some idle rumour of the servants from what they had seen in lady lowboroughs manner last month or perhaps from something that had passed between their master and her during her former visit
at dinner i narrowly observed both her and arthur and saw nothing extraordinary in the conduct of either nothing calculated to excite suspicion except in distrustful minds which mine was not and therefore i would not suspect
almost immediately after dinner annabella went out with her husband to share his moonlight ramble for it was a splendid evening like the last
mr hargrave entered the drawingroom a little before the others and challenged me to a game of chess
he did it without any of that sad but proud humility he usually assumes in addressing me unless he is excited with wine
i looked at his face to see if that was the case now
his eye met mine keenly but steadily there was something about him i did not understand but he seemed sober enough
not choosing to engage with him i referred him to milicent
she plays badly said he i want to match my skill with yours
come now
you cant pretend you are reluctant to lay down your work
i know you never take it up except to pass an idle hour when there is nothing better you can do but chessplayers are so unsociable i objected they are no company for any but themselves there is no one here but milicent and she oh i shall be delighted to watch you cried our mutual friend
two such playersit will be quite a treat
i wonder which will conquer i consented
now mrs huntingdon said hargrave as he arranged the men on the board speaking distinctly and with a peculiar emphasis as if he had a double meaning to all his words you are a good player but i am a better we shall have a long game and you will give me some trouble but i can be as patient as you and in the end i shall certainly win he fixed his eyes upon me with a glance i did not like keen crafty bold and almost impudentalready half triumphant in his anticipated success
i hope not mr hargrave returned i with vehemence that must have startled milicent at least but he only smiled and murmured time will show we set to work he sufficiently interested in the game but calm and fearless in the consciousness of superior skill i intensely eager to disappoint his expectations for i considered this the type of a more serious contest as i imagined he did and i felt an almost superstitious dread of being beaten at all events i could ill endure that present success should add one tittle to his conscious power his insolent selfconfidence i ought to say or encourage for a moment his dream of future conquest
his play was cautious and deep but i struggled hard against him
for some time the combat was doubtful at length to my joy the victory seemed inclining to my side i had taken several of his best pieces and manifestly baffled his projects
he put his hand to his brow and paused in evident perplexity
i rejoiced in my advantage but dared not glory in it yet
at length he lifted his head and quietly making his move looked at me and said calmly now you think you will win dont you i hope so replied i taking his pawn that he had pushed into the way of my bishop with so careless an air that i thought it was an oversight but was not generous enough under the circumstances to direct his attention to it and too heedless at the moment to foresee the afterconsequences of my move
it is those bishops that trouble me said he but the bold knight can overleap the reverend gentlemen taking my last bishop with his knight and now those sacred persons once removed i shall carry all before me oh walter how you talk cried milicent she has far more pieces than you still i intend to give you some trouble yet said i and perhaps sir you will find yourself checkmated before you are aware
look to your queen the combat deepened
the game was a long one and i did give him some trouble but he was a better player than i
what keen gamesters you are said mr hattersley who had now entered and been watching us for some time
why mrs huntingdon your hand trembles as if you had staked your all upon it
and walter you dog you look as deep and cool as if you were certain of success and as keen and cruel as if you would drain her hearts blood
but if i were you i wouldnt beat her for very fear shell hate you if you doshe will by heaven
i see it in her eye hold your tongue will you said i his talk distracted me for i was driven to extremities
a few more moves and i was inextricably entangled in the snare of my antagonist
check cried he i sought in agony some means of escape
mate he added quietly but with evident delight
he had suspended the utterance of that last fatal syllable the better to enjoy my dismay
i was foolishly disconcerted by the event
hattersley laughed milicent was troubled to see me so disturbed
hargrave placed his hand on mine that rested on the table and squeezing it with a firm but gentle pressure murmured beaten beaten and gazed into my face with a look where exultation was blended with an expression of ardour and tenderness yet more insulting
no never mr hargrave exclaimed i quickly withdrawing my hand
do you deny replied he smilingly pointing to the board
no no i answered recollecting how strange my conduct must appear you have beaten me in that game will you try another then no you acknowledge my superiority yes as a chessplayer i rose to resume my work
where is annabella said hargrave gravely after glancing round the room
gone out with lord lowborough answered i for he looked at me for a reply
and not yet returned he said seriously
i suppose not where is huntingdon looking round again
gone out with grimsby as you know said hattersley suppressing a laugh which broke forth as he concluded the sentence
why did he laugh
why did hargrave connect them thus together
was it true then
and was this the dreadful secret he had wished to reveal to me
i must know and that quickly
i instantly rose and left the room to go in search of rachel and demand an explanation of her words but mr hargrave followed me into the anteroom and before i could open its outer door gently laid his hand upon the lock
may i tell you something mrs huntingdon said he in a subdued tone with serious downcast eyes
if it be anything worth hearing replied i struggling to be composed for i trembled in every limb
he quietly pushed a chair towards me
i merely leant my hand upon it and bid him go on
do not be alarmed said he what i wish to say is nothing in itself and i will leave you to draw your own inferences from it
you say that annabella is not yet returned yes yesgo on said i impatiently for i feared my forced calmness would leave me before the end of his disclosure whatever it might be
and you hear continued he that huntingdon is gone out with grimsby well i heard the latter say to your husbandor the man who calls himself so go on sir he bowed submissively and continued i heard him sayi shall manage it youll see
theyre gone down by the water i shall meet them there and tell him i want a bit of talk with him about some things that we neednt trouble the lady with and shell say she can be walking back to the house and then i shall apologise you know and all that and tip her a wink to take the way of the shrubbery
ill keep him talking there about those matters i mentioned and anything else i can think of as long as i can and then bring him round the other way stopping to look at the trees the fields and anything else i can find to discourse of mr hargrave paused and looked at me
without a word of comment or further questioning i rose and darted from the room and out of the house
the torment of suspense was not to be endured i would not suspect my husband falsely on this mans accusation and i would not trust him unworthilyi must know the truth at once
i flew to the shrubbery
scarcely had i reached it when a sound of voices arrested my breathless speed
we have lingered too long he will be back said lady lowboroughs voice
surely not dearest was his reply but you can run across the lawn and get in as quietly as you can ill follow in a while my knees trembled under me my brain swam round
i was ready to faint
she must not see me thus
i shrunk among the bushes and leant against the trunk of a tree to let her pass
ah huntingdon said she reproachfully pausing where i had stood with him the night beforeit was here you kissed that woman she looked back into the leafy shade
advancing thence he answered with a careless laugh well dearest i couldnt help it
you know i must keep straight with her as long as i can
havent i seen you kiss your dolt of a husband scores of timesand do i ever complain but tell me dont you love her stilla little said she placing her hand on his arm looking earnestly in his facefor i could see them plainly the moon shining full upon them from between the branches of the tree that sheltered me
not one bit by all thats sacred he replied kissing her glowing cheek
good heavens i must be gone cried she suddenly breaking from him and away she flew
there he stood before me but i had not strength to confront him now my tongue cleaved to the roof of my mouth i was wellnigh sinking to the earth and i almost wondered he did not hear the beating of my heart above the low sighing of the wind and the fitful rustle of the falling leaves
my senses seemed to fail me but still i saw his shadowy form pass before me and through the rushing sound in my ears i distinctly heard him say as he stood looking up the lawnthere goes the fool
run annabella run
therein with you
ahhe didnt see
thats right grimsby keep him back and even his low laugh reached me as he walked away
god help me now i murmured sinking on my knees among the damp weeds and brushwood that surrounded me and looking up at the moonlit sky through the scant foliage above
it seemed all dim and quivering now to my darkened sight
my burning bursting heart strove to pour forth its agony to god but could not frame its anguish into prayer until a gust of wind swept over me which while it scattered the dead leaves like blighted hopes around cooled my forehead and seemed a little to revive my sinking frame
then while i lifted up my soul in speechless earnest supplication some heavenly influence seemed to strengthen me within i breathed more freely my vision cleared i saw distinctly the pure moon shining on and the light clouds skimming the clear dark sky and then i saw the eternal stars twinkling down upon me i knew their god was mine and he was strong to save and swift to hear
i will never leave thee nor forsake thee seemed whispered from above their myriad orbs
no no i felt he would not leave me comfortless in spite of earth and hell i should have strength for all my trials and win a glorious rest at last
refreshed invigorated if not composed i rose and returned to the house
much of my newborn strength and courage forsook me i confess as i entered it and shut out the fresh wind and the glorious sky everything i saw and heard seemed to sicken my heartthe hall the lamp the staircase the doors of the different apartments the social sound of talk and laughter from the drawingroom
how could i bear my future life
in this house among those peopleoh how could i endure to live
john just then entered the hall and seeing me told me he had been sent in search of me adding that he had taken in the tea and master wished to know if i were coming
ask mrs hattersley to be so kind as to make the tea john said i
say i am not well tonight and wish to be excused i retired into the large empty diningroom where all was silence and darkness but for the soft sighing of the wind without and the faint gleam of moonlight that pierced the blinds and curtains and there i walked rapidly up and down thinking of my bitter thoughts alone
how different was this from the evening of yesterday
that it seems was the last expiring flash of my lifes happiness
poor blinded fool that i was to be so happy
i could now see the reason of arthurs strange reception of me in the shrubbery the burst of kindness was for his paramour the start of horror for his wife
now too i could better understand the conversation between hattersley and grimsby it was doubtless of his love for her they spoke not for me
i heard the drawingroom door open a light quick step came out of the anteroom crossed the hall and ascended the stairs
it was milicent poor milicent gone to see how i wasno one else cared for me but she still was kind
i shed no tears before but now they came fast and free
thus she did me good without approaching me
disappointed in her search i heard her come down more slowly than she had ascended
would she come in there and find me out
no she turned in the opposite direction and reentered the drawingroom
i was glad for i knew not how to meet her or what to say
i wanted no confidante in my distress
i deserved none and i wanted none
i had taken the burden upon myself let me bear it alone
as the usual hour of retirement approached i dried my eyes and tried to clear my voice and calm my mind
i must see arthur tonight and speak to him but i would do it calmly there should be no scenenothing to complain or to boast of to his companionsnothing to laugh at with his ladylove
when the company were retiring to their chambers i gently opened the door and just as he passed beckoned him in
whats to do with you helen said he
why couldnt you come to make tea for us
and what the deuce are you here for in the dark
what ails you young woman you look like a ghost he continued surveying me by the light of his candle
no matter i answered to you you have no longer any regard for me it appears and i have no longer any for you hallo
what the devil is this he muttered
i would leave you tomorrow continued i and never again come under this roof but for my childi paused a moment to steady my voice
what in the devils name is this helen cried he
what can you be driving at you know perfectly well
let us waste no time in useless explanation but tell me will you he vehemently swore he knew nothing about it and insisted upon hearing what poisonous old woman had been blackening his name and what infamous lies i had been fool enough to believe
spare yourself the trouble of forswearing yourself and racking your brains to stifle truth with falsehood i coldly replied
i have trusted to the testimony of no third person
i was in the shrubbery this evening and i saw and heard for myself this was enough
he uttered a suppressed exclamation of consternation and dismay and muttering i shall catch it now set down his candle on the nearest chair and rearing his back against the wall stood confronting me with folded arms
well what then said he with the calm insolence of mingled shamelessness and desperation
only this returned i will you let me take our child and what remains of my fortune and go go where anywhere where he will be safe from your contaminating influence and i shall be delivered from your presence and you from mine no will you let me have the child then without the money no nor yourself without the child
do you think im going to be made the talk of the country for your fastidious caprices then i must stay here to be hated and despised
but henceforth we are husband and wife only in the name very good i am your childs mother and your housekeeper nothing more
so you need not trouble yourself any longer to feign the love you cannot feel i will exact no more heartless caresses from you nor offer nor endure them either
i will not be mocked with the empty husk of conjugal endearments when you have given the substance to another very good if you please
we shall see who will tire first my lady if i tire it will be of living in the world with you not of living without your mockery of love
when you tire of your sinful ways and show yourself truly repentant i will forgive you and perhaps try to love you again though that will be hard indeed humph
and meantime you will go and talk me over to mrs hargrave and write long letters to aunt maxwell to complain of the wicked wretch you have married i shall complain to no one
hitherto i have struggled hard to hide your vices from every eye and invest you with virtues you never possessed but now you must look to yourself i left him muttering bad language to himself and went upstairs
you are poorly maam said rachel surveying me with deep anxiety
it is too true rachel said i answering her sad looks rather than her words
i knew it or i wouldnt have mentioned such a thing but dont you trouble yourself about it said i kissing her pale timewasted cheek
i can bear it better than you imagine yes you were always for bearing but if i was you i wouldnt bear it id give way to it and cry right hard
and id talk too i just wouldid let him know what it was to i have talked said i ive said enough then id cry persisted she
i wouldnt look so white and so calm and burst my heart with keeping it in i have cried said i smiling in spite of my misery and i am calm now really so dont discompose me again nurse let us say no more about it and dont mention it to the servants
there you may go now
goodnight and dont disturb your rest for me i shall sleep wellif i can notwithstanding this resolution i found my bed so intolerable that before two oclock i rose and lighting my candle by the rushlight that was still burning i got my desk and sat down in my dressinggown to recount the events of the past evening
it was better to be so occupied than to be lying in bed torturing my brain with recollections of the far past and anticipations of the dreadful future
i have found relief in describing the very circumstances that have destroyed my peace as well as the little trivial details attendant upon their discovery
no sleep i could have got this night would have done so much towards composing my mind and preparing me to meet the trials of the day
i fancy so at least and yet when i cease writing i find my head aches terribly and when i look into the glass i am startled at my haggard worn appearance
rachel has been to dress me and says i have had a sad night of it she can see
milicent has just looked in to ask me how i was
i told her i was better but to excuse my appearance admitted i had had a restless night
i wish this day were over
i shudder at the thoughts of going down to breakfast
how shall i encounter them all
yet let me remember it is not i that am guilty i have no cause to fear and if they scorn me as a victim of their guilt i can pity their folly and despise their scorn
eveningbreakfast passed well over i was calm and cool throughout
i answered composedly all inquiries respecting my health and whatever was unusual in my look or manner was generally attributed to the trifling indisposition that had occasioned my early retirement last night
but how am i to get over the ten or twelve days that must yet elapse before they go
yet why so long for their departure
when they are gone how shall i get through the months or years of my future life in company with that manmy greatest enemy
for none could injure me as he has done
oh
when i think how fondly how foolishly i have loved him how madly i have trusted him how constantly i have laboured and studied and prayed and struggled for his advantage and how cruelly he has trampled on my love betrayed my trust scorned my prayers and tears and efforts for his preservation crushed my hopes destroyed my youths best feelings and doomed me to a life of hopeless misery as far as man can do it it is not enough to say that i no longer love my husbandi hate him
the word stares me in the face like a guilty confession but it is true i hate himi hate him
but god have mercy on his miserable soul
and make him see and feel his guilti ask no other vengeance
if he could but fully know and truly feel my wrongs i should be well avenged and i could freely pardon all but he is so lost so hardened in his heartless depravity that in this life i believe he never will
but it is useless dwelling on this theme let me seek once more to dissipate reflection in the minor details of passing events
mr hargrave has annoyed me all day long with his serious sympathising and as he thinks unobtrusive politeness
if it were more obtrusive it would trouble me less for then i could snub him but as it is he contrives to appear so really kind and thoughtful that i cannot do so without rudeness and seeming ingratitude
i sometimes think i ought to give him credit for the good feeling he simulates so well and then again i think it is my duty to suspect him under the peculiar circumstances in which i am placed
his kindness may not all be feigned but still let not the purest impulse of gratitude to him induce me to forget myself let me remember the game of chess the expressions he used on the occasion and those indescribable looks of his that so justly roused my indignation and i think i shall be safe enough
i have done well to record them so minutely
i think he wishes to find an opportunity of speaking to me alone he has seemed to be on the watch all day but i have taken care to disappoint himnot that i fear anything he could say but i have trouble enough without the addition of his insulting consolations condolences or whatever else he might attempt and for milicents sake i do not wish to quarrel with him
he excused himself from going out to shoot with the other gentlemen in the morning under the pretext of having letters to write and instead of retiring for that purpose into the library he sent for his desk into the morningroom where i was seated with milicent and lady lowborough
they had betaken themselves to their work i less to divert my mind than to deprecate conversation had provided myself with a book
milicent saw that i wished to be quiet and accordingly let me alone
annabella doubtless saw it too but that was no reason why she should restrain her tongue or curb her cheerful spirits she accordingly chatted away addressing herself almost exclusively to me and with the utmost assurance and familiarity growing the more animated and friendly the colder and briefer my answers became
mr hargrave saw that i could ill endure it and looking up from his desk he answered her questions and observations for me as far as he could and attempted to transfer her social attentions from me to himself but it would not do
perhaps she thought i had a headache and could not bear to talk at any rate she saw that her loquacious vivacity annoyed me as i could tell by the malicious pertinacity with which she persisted
but i checked it effectually by putting into her hand the book i had been trying to read on the flyleaf of which i had hastily scribbled i am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any real friendship for you and as i am without your talent for dissimulation i cannot assume the appearance of it
i must therefore beg that hereafter all familiar intercourse may cease between us and if i still continue to treat you with civility as if you were a woman worthy of consideration and respect understand that it is out of regard for your cousin milicents feelings not for yours upon perusing this she turned scarlet and bit her lip
covertly tearing away the leaf she crumpled it up and put it in the fire and then employed herself in turning over the pages of the book and really or apparently perusing its contents
in a little while milicent announced it her intention to repair to the nursery and asked if i would accompany her
annabella will excuse us said she shes busy reading no i wont cried annabella suddenly looking up and throwing her book on the table i want to speak to helen a minute
you may go milicent and shell follow in a while milicent went
will you oblige me helen continued she
her impudence astounded me but i complied and followed her into the library
she closed the door and walked up to the fire
who told you this said she
no one i am not incapable of seeing for myself ah you are suspicious cried she smiling with a gleam of hope
hitherto there had been a kind of desperation in her hardihood now she was evidently relieved
if i were suspicious i replied i should have discovered your infamy long before
no lady lowborough i do not found my charge upon suspicion on what do you found it then said she throwing herself into an armchair and stretching out her feet to the fender with an obvious effort to appear composed
i enjoy a moonlight ramble as well as you i answered steadily fixing my eyes upon her and the shrubbery happens to be one of my favourite resorts she coloured again excessively and remained silent pressing her finger against her teeth and gazing into the fire
i watched her a few moments with a feeling of malevolent gratification then moving towards the door i calmly asked if she had anything more to say
yes yes cried she eagerly starting up from her reclining posture
i want to know if you will tell lord lowborough suppose i do well if you are disposed to publish the matter i cannot dissuade you of coursebut there will be terrible work if you doand if you dont i shall think you the most generous of mortal beingsand if there is anything in the world i can do for youanything short of she hesitated
short of renouncing your guilty connection with my husband i suppose you mean said i
she paused in evident disconcertion and perplexity mingled with anger she dared not show
i cannot renounce what is dearer than life she muttered in a low hurried tone
then suddenly raising her head and fixing her gleaming eyes upon me she continued earnestly but helenor mrs huntingdon or whatever you would have me call youwill you tell him
if you are generous here is a fitting opportunity for the exercise of your magnanimity if you are proud here am iyour rivalready to acknowledge myself your debtor for an act of the most noble forbearance i shall not tell him you will not cried she delightedly
accept my sincere thanks then she sprang up and offered me her hand
i drew back
give me no thanks it is not for your sake that i refrain
neither is it an act of any forbearance i have no wish to publish your shame
i should be sorry to distress your husband with the knowledge of it and milicent
will you tell her no on the contrary i shall do my utmost to conceal it from her
i would not for much that she should know the infamy and disgrace of her relation you use hard words mrs huntingdon but i can pardon you and now lady lowborough continued i let me counsel you to leave this house as soon as possible
you must be aware that your continuance here is excessively disagreeable to menot for mr huntingdons sake said i observing the dawn of a malicious smile of triumph on her faceyou are welcome to him if you like him as far as i am concernedbut because it is painful to be always disguising my true sentiments respecting you and straining to keep up an appearance of civility and respect towards one for whom i have not the most distant shadow of esteem and because if you stay your conduct cannot possibly remain concealed much longer from the only two persons in the house who do not know it already
and for your husbands sake annabella and even for your own i wishi earnestly advise and entreat you to break off this unlawful connection at once and return to your duty while you may before the dreadful consequences yes yes of course said she interrupting me with a gesture of impatience
but i cannot go helen before the time appointed for our departure
what possible pretext could i frame for such a thing
whether i proposed going back alonewhich lowborough would not hear ofor taking him with me the very circumstance itself would be certain to excite suspicionand when our visit is so nearly at an end toolittle more than a weeksurely you can endure my presence so long
i will not annoy you with any more of my friendly impertinences well i have nothing more to say to you have you mentioned this affair to huntingdon asked she as i was leaving the room
how dare you mention his name to me was the only answer i gave
no words have passed between us since but such as outward decency or pure necessity demanded
nineteenthin proportion as lady lowborough finds she has nothing to fear from me and as the time of departure draws nigh the more audacious and insolent she becomes
she does not scruple to speak to my husband with affectionate familiarity in my presence when no one else is by and is particularly fond of displaying her interest in his health and welfare or in anything that concerns him as if for the purpose of contrasting her kind solicitude with my cold indifference
and he rewards her by such smiles and glances such whispered words or boldlyspoken insinuations indicative of his sense of her goodness and my neglect as make the blood rush into my face in spite of myselffor i would be utterly regardless of it alldeaf and blind to everything that passes between them since the more i show myself sensible of their wickedness the more she triumphs in her victory and the more he flatters himself that i love him devotedly still in spite of my pretended indifference
on such occasions i have sometimes been startled by a subtle fiendish suggestion inciting me to show him the contrary by a seeming encouragement of hargraves advances but such ideas are banished in a moment with horror and selfabasement and then i hate him tenfold more than ever for having brought me to thisgod pardon me for it and all my sinful thoughts
instead of being humbled and purified by my afflictions i feel that they are turning my nature into gall
this must be my fault as much as theirs that wrong me
no true christian could cherish such bitter feelings as i do against him and her especially the latter him i still feel that i could pardonfreely gladlyon the slightest token of repentance but shewords cannot utter my abhorrence
reason forbids but passion urges strongly and i must pray and struggle long ere i subdue it
it is well that she is leaving tomorrow for i could not well endure her presence for another day
this morning she rose earlier than usual
i found her in the room alone when i went down to breakfast
oh helen
is it you said she turning as i entered
i gave an involuntary start back on seeing her at which she uttered a short laugh observing i think we are both disappointed i came forward and busied myself with the breakfast things
this is the last day i shall burden your hospitality said she as she seated herself at the table
ah here comes one that will not rejoice at it she murmured half to herself as arthur entered the room
he shook hands with her and wished her goodmorning then looking lovingly in her face and still retaining her hand in his murmured pathetically the lastlast day yes said she with some asperity and i rose early to make the best of iti have been here alone this halfhour and youyou lazy creature well i thought i was early too said he but dropping his voice almost to a whisper you see we are not alone we never are returned she
but they were almost as good as alone for i was now standing at the window watching the clouds and struggling to suppress my wrath
some more words passed between them which happily i did not overhear but annabella had the audacity to come and place herself beside me and even to put her hand upon my shoulder and say softly you need not grudge him to me helen for i love him more than ever you could do this put me beside myself
i took her hand and violently dashed it from me with an expression of abhorrence and indignation that could not be suppressed
startled almost appalled by this sudden outbreak she recoiled in silence
i would have given way to my fury and said more but arthurs low laugh recalled me to myself
i checked the halfuttered invective and scornfully turned away regretting that i had given him so much amusement
he was still laughing when mr hargrave made his appearance
how much of the scene he had witnessed i do not know for the door was ajar when he entered
he greeted his host and his cousin both coldly and me with a glance intended to express the deepest sympathy mingled with high admiration and esteem
how much allegiance do you owe to that man he asked below his breath as he stood beside me at the window affecting to be making observations on the weather
none i answered
and immediately returning to the table i employed myself in making the tea
he followed and would have entered into some kind of conversation with me but the other guests were now beginning to assemble and i took no more notice of him except to give him his coffee
after breakfast determined to pass as little of the day as possible in company with lady lowborough i quietly stole away from the company and retired to the library
mr hargrave followed me thither under pretence of coming for a book and first turning to the shelves he selected a volume and then quietly but by no means timidly approaching me he stood beside me resting his hand on the back of my chair and said softly and so you consider yourself free at last yes said i without moving or raising my eyes from my book free to do anything but offend god and my conscience there was a momentary pause
very right said he provided your conscience be not too morbidly tender and your ideas of god not too erroneously severe but can you suppose it would offend that benevolent being to make the happiness of one who would die for yoursto raise a devoted heart from purgatorial torments to a state of heavenly bliss when you could do it without the slightest injury to yourself or any other this was spoken in a low earnest melting tone as he bent over me
i now raised my head and steadily confronting his gaze i answered calmly mr
hargrave do you mean to insult me he was not prepared for this
he paused a moment to recover the shock then drawing himself up and removing his hand from my chair he answered with proud sadnessthat was not my intention i just glanced towards the door with a slight movement of the head and then returned to my book
he immediately withdrew
this was better than if i had answered with more words and in the passionate spirit to which my first impulse would have prompted
what a good thing it is to be able to command ones temper
i must labour to cultivate this inestimable quality god only knows how often i shall need it in this rough dark road that lies before me
in the course of the morning i drove over to the grove with the two ladies to give milicent an opportunity for bidding farewell to her mother and sister
they persuaded her to stay with them the rest of the day mrs hargrave promising to bring her back in the evening and remain till the party broke up on the morrow
consequently lady lowborough and i had the pleasure of returning ttette in the carriage together
for the first mile or two we kept silence i looking out of my window and she leaning back in her corner
but i was not going to restrict myself to any particular position for her when i was tired of leaning forward with the cold raw wind in my face and surveying the russet hedges and the damp tangled grass of their banks i gave it up and leant back too
with her usual impudence my companion then made some attempts to get up a conversation but the monosyllables yes or no or humph were the utmost her several remarks could elicit from me
at last on her asking my opinion upon some immaterial point of discussion i answered why do you wish to talk to me lady lowborough
you must know what i think of you well if you will be so bitter against me replied she i cant help it but im not going to sulk for anybody our short drive was now at an end
as soon as the carriage door was opened she sprang out and went down the park to meet the gentlemen who were just returning from the woods
of course i did not follow
but i had not done with her impudence yet after dinner i retired to the drawingroom as usual and she accompanied me but i had the two children with me and i gave them my whole attention and determined to keep them till the gentlemen came or till milicent arrived with her mother
little helen however was soon tired of playing and insisted upon going to sleep and while i sat on the sofa with her on my knee and arthur seated beside me gently playing with her soft flaxen hair lady lowborough composedly came and placed herself on the other side
tomorrow mrs huntingdon said she you will be delivered from my presence which no doubt you will be very glad ofit is natural you should but do you know i have rendered you a great service
shall i tell you what it is i shall be glad to hear of any service you have rendered me said i determined to be calm for i knew by the tone of her voice she wanted to provoke me
well resumed she have you not observed the salutary change in mr huntingdon
dont you see what a sober temperate man he is become
you saw with regret the sad habits he was contracting i know and i know you did your utmost to deliver him from them but without success until i came to your assistance
i told him in few words that i could not bear to see him degrade himself so and that i should cease tono matter what i told him but you see the reformation i have wrought and you ought to thank me for it i rose and rang for the nurse
but i desire no thanks she continued all the return i ask is that you will take care of him when i am gone and not by harshness and neglect drive him back to his old courses i was almost sick with passion but rachel was now at the door
i pointed to the children for i could not trust myself to speak she took them away and i followed
will you helen continued the speaker
i gave her a look that blighted the malicious smile on her face or checked it at least for a moment and departed
in the anteroom i met mr hargrave
he saw i was in no humour to be spoken to and suffered me to pass without a word but when after a few minutes seclusion in the library i had regained my composure and was returning to join mrs hargrave and milicent whom i had just heard come downstairs and go into the drawingroom i found him there still lingering in the dimlylighted apartment and evidently waiting for me
mrs
huntingdon said he as i passed will you allow me one word what is it then
be quick if you please i offended you this morning and i cannot live under your displeasure then go and sin no more replied i turning away
no no said he hastily setting himself before me
pardon me but i must have your forgiveness
i leave you tomorrow and i may not have an opportunity of speaking to you again
i was wrong to forget myself and you as i did but let me implore you to forget and forgive my rash presumption and think of me as if those words had never been spoken for believe me i regret them deeply and the loss of your esteem is too severe a penalty i cannot bear it forgetfulness is not to be purchased with a wish and i cannot bestow my esteem on all who desire it unless they deserve it too i shall think my life well spent in labouring to deserve it if you will but pardon this offencewill you yes yes
but that is coldly spoken
give me your hand and ill believe you
you wont
then mrs huntingdon you do not forgive me yes here it is and my forgiveness with it only sin no more he pressed my cold hand with sentimental fervour but said nothing and stood aside to let me pass into the room where all the company were now assembled
mr grimsby was seated near the door on seeing me enter almost immediately followed by hargrave he leered at me with a glance of intolerable significance as i passed
i looked him in the face till he sullenly turned away if not ashamed at least confounded for the moment
meantime hattersley had seized hargrave by the arm and was whispering something in his earsome coarse joke no doubt for the latter neither laughed nor spoke in answer but turning from him with a slight curl of the lip disengaged himself and went to his mother who was telling lord lowborough how many reasons she had to be proud of her son
thank heaven they are all going tomorrow
december th this is the third anniversary of our felicitous union
it is now two months since our guests left us to the enjoyment of each others society and i have had nine weeks experience of this new phase of conjugal lifetwo persons living together as master and mistress of the house and father and mother of a winsome merry little child with the mutual understanding that there is no love friendship or sympathy between them
as far as in me lies i endeavour to live peaceably with him i treat him with unimpeachable civility give up my convenience to his wherever it may reasonably be done and consult him in a businesslike way on household affairs deferring to his pleasure and judgment even when i know the latter to be inferior to my own
as for him for the first week or two he was peevish and low fretting i suppose over his dear annabellas departure and particularly illtempered to me everything i did was wrong i was coldhearted hard insensate my sour pale face was perfectly repulsive my voice made him shudder he knew not how he could live through the winter with me i should kill him by inches
again i proposed a separation but it would not do he was not going to be the talk of all the old gossips in the neighbourhood he would not have it said that he was such a brute his wife could not live with him
no he must contrive to bear with me
i must contrive to bear with you you mean said i for so long as i discharge my functions of steward and housekeeper so conscientiously and well without pay and without thanks you cannot afford to part with me
i shall therefore remit these duties when my bondage becomes intolerable this threat i thought would serve to keep him in check if anything would
i believe he was much disappointed that i did not feel his offensive sayings more acutely for when he had said anything particularly well calculated to hurt my feelings he would stare me searchingly in the face and then grumble against my marble heart or my brutal insensibility if i had bitterly wept and deplored his lost affection he would perhaps have condescended to pity me and taken me into favour for a while just to comfort his solitude and console him for the absence of his beloved annabella until he could meet her again or some more fitting substitute
thank heaven i am not so weak as that
i was infatuated once with a foolish besotted affection that clung to him in spite of his unworthiness but it is fairly gone nowwholly crushed and withered away and he has none but himself and his vices to thank for it
at first in compliance with his sweet ladys injunctions i suppose he abstained wonderfully well from seeking to solace his cares in wine but at length he began to relax his virtuous efforts and now and then exceeded a little and still continues to do so nay sometimes not a little
when he is under the exciting influence of these excesses he sometimes fires up and attempts to play the brute and then i take little pains to suppress my scorn and disgust
when he is under the depressing influence of the afterconsequences he bemoans his sufferings and his errors and charges them both upon me he knows such indulgence injures his health and does him more harm than good but he says i drive him to it by my unnatural unwomanly conduct it will be the ruin of him in the end but it is all my fault and then i am roused to defend myself sometimes with bitter recrimination
this is a kind of injustice i cannot patiently endure
have i not laboured long and hard to save him from this very vice
would i not labour still to deliver him from it if i could
but could i do so by fawning upon him and caressing him when i know that he scorns me
is it my fault that i have lost my influence with him or that he has forfeited every claim to my regard
and should i seek a reconciliation with him when i feel that i abhor him and that he despises me
and while he continues still to correspond with lady lowborough as i know he does
no never never never
he may drink himself dead but it is not my fault
yet i do my part to save him still i give him to understand that drinking makes his eyes dull and his face red and bloated and that it tends to render him imbecile in body and mind and if annabella were to see him as often as i do she would speedily be disenchanted and that she certainly will withdraw her favour from him if he continues such courses
such a mode of admonition wins only coarse abuse for meand indeed i almost feel as if i deserved it for i hate to use such arguments but they sink into his stupefied heart and make him pause and ponder and abstain more than anything else i could say
at present i am enjoying a temporary relief from his presence he is gone with hargrave to join a distant hunt and will probably not be back before tomorrow evening
how differently i used to feel his absence
mr hargrave is still at the grove
he and arthur frequently meet to pursue their rural sports together he often calls upon us here and arthur not unfrequently rides over to him
i do not think either of these soidisant friends is overflowing with love for the other but such intercourse serves to get the time on and i am very willing it should continue as it saves me some hours of discomfort in arthurs society and gives him some better employment than the sottish indulgence of his sensual appetites
the only objection i have to mr hargraves being in the neighbourhood is that the fear of meeting him at the grove prevents me from seeing his sister so often as i otherwise should for of late he has conducted himself towards me with such unerring propriety that i have almost forgotten his former conduct
i suppose he is striving to win my esteem if he continue to act in this way he may win it but what then
the moment he attempts to demand anything more he will lose it again
february thit is a hard embittering thing to have ones kind feelings and good intentions cast back in ones teeth
i was beginning to relent towards my wretched partner to pity his forlorn comfortless condition unalleviated as it is by the consolations of intellectual resources and the answer of a good conscience towards god and to think i ought to sacrifice my pride and renew my efforts once again to make his home agreeable and lead him back to the path of virtue not by false professions of love and not by pretended remorse but by mitigating my habitual coldness of manner and commuting my frigid civility into kindness wherever an opportunity occurred and not only was i beginning to think so but i had already begun to act upon the thoughtand what was the result
no answering spark of kindness no awakening penitence but an unappeasable illhumour and a spirit of tyrannous exaction that increased with indulgence and a lurking gleam of selfcomplacent triumph at every detection of relenting softness in my manner that congealed me to marble again as often as it recurred and this morning he finished the businessi think the petrifaction is so completely effected at last that nothing can melt me again
among his letters was one which he perused with symptoms of unusual gratification and then threw it across the table to me with the admonition there
read that and take a lesson by it it was in the free dashing hand of lady lowborough
i glanced at the first page it seemed full of extravagant protestations of affection impetuous longings for a speedy reunionand impious defiance of gods mandates and railings against his providence for having cast their lot asunder and doomed them both to the hateful bondage of alliance with those they could not love
he gave a slight titter on seeing me change colour
i folded up the letter rose and returned it to him with no remark but thank you i will take a lesson by it my little arthur was standing between his knees delightedly playing with the bright ruby ring on his finger
urged by a sudden imperative impulse to deliver my son from that contaminating influence i caught him up in my arms and carried him with me out of the room
not liking this abrupt removal the child began to pout and cry
this was a new stab to my already tortured heart
i would not let him go but taking him with me into the library i shut the door and kneeling on the floor beside him i embraced him kissed him wept over with him with passionate fondness
rather frightened than consoled by this he turned struggling from me and cried out aloud for his papa
i released him from my arms and never were more bitter tears than those that now concealed him from my blinded burning eyes
hearing his cries the father came to the room
i instantly turned away lest he should see and misconstrue my emotion
he swore at me and took the now pacified child away
it is hard that my little darling should love him more than me and that when the wellbeing and culture of my son is all i have to live for i should see my influence destroyed by one whose selfish affection is more injurious than the coldest indifference or the harshest tyranny could be
if i for his good deny him some trifling indulgence he goes to his father and the latter in spite of his selfish indolence will even give himself some trouble to meet the childs desires if i attempt to curb his will or look gravely on him for some act of childish disobedience he knows his other parent will smile and take his part against me
thus not only have i the fathers spirit in the son to contend against the germs of his evil tendencies to search out and eradicate and his corrupting intercourse and example in afterlife to counteract but already he counteracts my arduous labour for the childs advantage destroys my influence over his tender mind and robs me of his very love i had no earthly hope but this and he seems to take a diabolical delight in tearing it away
but it is wrong to despair i will remember the counsel of the inspired writer to him that feareth the lord and obeyeth the voice of his servant that sitteth in darkness and hath no light let him trust in the name of the lord and stay upon his god december th another year is past and i am weary of this life
and yet i cannot wish to leave it whatever afflictions assail me here i cannot wish to go and leave my darling in this dark and wicked world alone without a friend to guide him through its weary mazes to warn him of its thousand snares and guard him from the perils that beset him on every hand
i am not well fitted to be his only companion i know but there is no other to supply my place
i am too grave to minister to his amusements and enter into his infantile sports as a nurse or a mother ought to do and often his bursts of gleeful merriment trouble and alarm me i see in them his fathers spirit and temperament and i tremble for the consequences and too often damp the innocent mirth i ought to share
that father on the contrary has no weight of sadness on his mind is troubled with no fears no scruples concerning his sons future welfare and at evenings especially the times when the child sees him the most and the oftenest he is always particularly jocund and openhearted ready to laugh and to jest with anything or anybody but me and i am particularly silent and sad therefore of course the child dotes upon his seemingly joyous amusing everindulgent papa and will at any time gladly exchange my company for his
this disturbs me greatly not so much for the sake of my sons affection though i do prize that highly and though i feel it is my right and know i have done much to earn it as for that influence over him which for his own advantage i would strive to purchase and retain and which for very spite his father delights to rob me of and from motives of mere idle egotism is pleased to win to himself making no use of it but to torment me and ruin the child
my only consolation is that he spends comparatively little of his time at home and during the months he passes in london or elsewhere i have a chance of recovering the ground i had lost and overcoming with good the evil he has wrought by his wilful mismanagement
but then it is a bitter trial to behold him on his return doing his utmost to subvert my labours and transform my innocent affectionate tractable darling into a selfish disobedient and mischievous boy thereby preparing the soil for those vices he has so successfully cultivated in his own perverted nature
happily there were none of arthurs friends invited to grassdale last autumn he took himself off to visit some of them instead
i wish he would always do so and i wish his friends were numerous and loving enough to keep him amongst them all the year round
mr hargrave considerably to my annoyance did not go with him but i think i have done with that gentleman at last
for seven or eight months he behaved so remarkably well and managed so skilfully too that i was almost completely off my guard and was really beginning to look upon him as a friend and even to treat him as such with certain prudent restrictions which i deemed scarcely necessary when presuming upon my unsuspecting kindness he thought he might venture to overstep the bounds of decent moderation and propriety that had so long restrained him
it was on a pleasant evening at the close of may i was wandering in the park and he on seeing me there as he rode past made bold to enter and approach me dismounting and leaving his horse at the gate
this was the first time he had ventured to come within its inclosure since i had been left alone without the sanction of his mothers or sisters company or at least the excuse of a message from them
but he managed to appear so calm and easy so respectful and selfpossessed in his friendliness that though a little surprised i was neither alarmed nor offended at the unusual liberty and he walked with me under the ashtrees and by the waterside and talked with considerable animation good taste and intelligence on many subjects before i began to think about getting rid of him
then after a pause during which we both stood gazing on the calm blue wateri revolving in my mind the best means of politely dismissing my companion he no doubt pondering other matters equally alien to the sweet sights and sounds that alone were present to his senseshe suddenly electrified me by beginning in a peculiar tone low soft but perfectly distinct to pour forth the most unequivocal expressions of earnest and passionate love pleading his cause with all the bold yet artful eloquence he could summon to his aid
but i cut short his appeal and repulsed him so determinately so decidedly and with such a mixture of scornful indignation tempered with cool dispassionate sorrow and pity for his benighted mind that he withdrew astonished mortified and discomforted and a few days after i heard that he had departed for london
he returned however in eight or nine weeks and did not entirely keep aloof from me but comported himself in so remarkable a manner that his quicksighted sister could not fail to notice the change
what have you done to walter mrs huntingdon said she one morning when i had called at the grove and he had just left the room after exchanging a few words of the coldest civility
he has been so extremely ceremonious and stately of late i cant imagine what it is all about unless you have desperately offended him
tell me what it is that i may be your mediator and make you friends again i have done nothing willingly to offend him said i
if he is offended he can best tell you himself what it is about ill ask him cried the giddy girl springing up and putting her head out of the window hes only in the gardenwalter no no esther
you will seriously displease me if you do and i shall leave you immediately and not come again for monthsperhaps years did you call esther said her brother approaching the window from without
yes i wanted to ask you goodmorning esther said i taking her hand and giving it a severe squeeze
to ask you continued she to get me a rose for mrs huntingdon he departed
mrs
huntingdon she exclaimed turning to me and still holding me fast by the hand im quite shocked at youyoure just as angry and distant and cold as he is and im determined you shall be as good friends as ever before you go esther how can you be so rude cried mrs hargrave who was seated gravely knitting in her easychair
surely you never will learn to conduct yourself like a lady well mamma you said yourself but the young lady was silenced by the uplifted finger of her mamma accompanied with a very stern shake of the head
isnt she cross whispered she to me but before i could add my share of reproof mr hargrave reappeared at the window with a beautiful mossrose in his hand
here esther ive brought you the rose said he extending it towards her
give it her yourself you blockhead cried she recoiling with a spring from between us
mrs
huntingdon would rather receive it from you replied he in a very serious tone but lowering his voice that his mother might not hear
his sister took the rose and gave it to me
my brothers compliments mrs huntingdon and he hopes you and he will come to a better understanding byandby
will that do walter added the saucy girl turning to him and putting her arm round his neck as he stood leaning upon the sill of the windowor should i have said that you are sorry you were so touchy
or that you hope she will pardon your offence you silly girl
you dont know what you are talking about replied he gravely
indeed i dont for im quite in the dark now esther interposed mrs hargrave who if equally benighted on the subject of our estrangement saw at least that her daughter was behaving very improperly i must insist upon your leaving the room pray dont mrs hargrave for im going to leave it myself said i and immediately made my adieux
about a week after mr hargrave brought his sister to see me
he conducted himself at first with his usual cold distant halfstately halfmelancholy altogether injured air but esther made no remark upon it this time she had evidently been schooled into better manners
she talked to me and laughed and romped with little arthur her loved and loving playmate
he somewhat to my discomfort enticed her from the room to have a run in the hall and thence into the garden
i got up to stir the fire
mr hargrave asked if i felt cold and shut the doora very unseasonable piece of officiousness for i had meditated following the noisy playfellows if they did not speedily return
he then took the liberty of walking up to the fire himself and asking me if i were aware that mr huntingdon was now at the seat of lord lowborough and likely to continue there some time
no but its no matter i answered carelessly and if my cheek glowed like fire it was rather at the question than the information it conveyed
you dont object to it he said
not at all if lord lowborough likes his company you have no love left for him then not the least i knew thati knew you were too highminded and pure in your own nature to continue to regard one so utterly false and polluted with any feelings but those of indignation and scornful abhorrence is he not your friend said i turning my eyes from the fire to his face with perhaps a slight touch of those feelings he assigned to another
he was replied he with the same calm gravity as before but do not wrong me by supposing that i could continue my friendship and esteem to a man who could so infamously so impiously forsake and injure one so transcendentlywell i wont speak of it
but tell me do you never think of revenge revenge
nowhat good would that doit would make him no better and me no happier i dont know how to talk to you mrs huntingdon said he smiling you are only half a womanyour nature must be half human half angelic
such goodness overawes me i dont know what to make of it then sir i fear you must be very much worse than you should be if i a mere ordinary mortal am by your own confession so vastly your superior and since there exists so little sympathy between us i think we had better each look out for some more congenial companion and forthwith moving to the window i began to look out for my little son and his gay young friend
no i am the ordinary mortal i maintain replied mr hargrave
i will not allow myself to be worse than my fellows but you madami equally maintain there is nobody like you
but are you happy he asked in a serious tone
as happy as some others i suppose are you as happy as you desire to be no one is so blest as that comes to on this side of eternity one thing i know returned he with a deep sad sigh you are immeasurably happier than i am i am very sorry for you then i could not help replying
are you indeed no for if you were you would be glad to relieve me and so i should if i could do so without injuring myself or any other and can you suppose that i should wish you to injure yourself
no on the contrary it is your own happiness i long for more than mine
you are miserable now mrs huntingdon continued he looking me boldly in the face
you do not complain but i seeand feeland know that you are miserableand must remain so as long as you keep those walls of impenetrable ice about your still warm and palpitating heart and i am miserable too
deign to smile on me and i am happy trust me and you shall be happy also for if you are a woman i can make you soand i will do it in spite of yourself he muttered between his teeth and as for others the question is between ourselves alone you cannot injure your husband you know and no one else has any concern in the matter i have a son mr hargrave and you have a mother said i retiring from the window whither he had followed me
they need not know he began but before anything more could be said on either side esther and arthur reentered the room
the former glanced at walters flushed excited countenance and then at minea little flushed and excited too i daresay though from far different causes
she must have thought we had been quarrelling desperately and was evidently perplexed and disturbed at the circumstance but she was too polite or too much afraid of her brothers anger to refer to it
she seated herself on the sofa and putting back her bright golden ringlets that were scattered in wild profusion over her face she immediately began to talk about the garden and her little playfellow and continued to chatter away in her usual strain till her brother summoned her to depart
if i have spoken too warmly forgive me he murmured on taking his leave or i shall never forgive myself esther smiled and glanced at me i merely bowed and her countenance fell
she thought it a poor return for walters generous concession and was disappointed in her friend
poor child she little knows the world she lives in
mr hargrave had not an opportunity of meeting me again in private for several weeks after this but when he did meet me there was less of pride and more of touching melancholy in his manner than before
oh how he annoyed me
i was obliged at last almost entirely to remit my visits to the grove at the expense of deeply offending mrs hargrave and seriously afflicting poor esther who really values my society for want of better and who ought not to suffer for the fault of her brother
but that indefatigable foe was not yet vanquished he seemed to be always on the watch
i frequently saw him riding lingeringly past the premises looking searchingly round him as he wentor if i did not rachel did
that sharpsighted woman soon guessed how matters stood between us and descrying the enemys movements from her elevation at the nurserywindow she would give me a quiet intimation if she saw me preparing for a walk when she had reason to believe he was about or to think it likely that he would meet or overtake me in the way i meant to traverse
i would then defer my ramble or confine myself for that day to the park and gardens or if the proposed excursion was a matter of importance such as a visit to the sick or afflicted i would take rachel with me and then i was never molested
but one mild sunshiny day early in november i had ventured forth alone to visit the village school and a few of the poor tenants and on my return i was alarmed at the clatter of a horses feet behind me approaching at a rapid steady trot
there was no stile or gap at hand by which i could escape into the fields so i walked quietly on saying to myself it may not be he after all and if it is and if he do annoy me it shall be for the last time i am determined if there be power in words and looks against cool impudence and mawkish sentimentality so inexhaustible as his the horse soon overtook me and was reined up close beside me
it was mr hargrave
he greeted me with a smile intended to be soft and melancholy but his triumphant satisfaction at having caught me at last so shone through that it was quite a failure
after briefly answering his salutation and inquiring after the ladies at the grove i turned away and walked on but he followed and kept his horse at my side it was evident he intended to be my companion all the way
well
i dont much care
if you want another rebuff take itand welcome was my inward remark
now sir what next this question though unspoken was not long unanswered after a few passing observations upon indifferent subjects he began in solemn tones the following appeal to my humanity it will be four years next april since i first saw you mrs huntingdonyou may have forgotten the circumstance but i never can
i admired you then most deeply but i dared not love you
in the following autumn i saw so much of your perfections that i could not fail to love you though i dared not show it
for upwards of three years i have endured a perfect martyrdom
from the anguish of suppressed emotions intense and fruitless longings silent sorrow crushed hopes and trampled affections i have suffered more than i can tell or you imagineand you were the cause of it and not altogether the innocent cause
my youth is wasting away my prospects are darkened my life is a desolate blank i have no rest day or night i am become a burden to myself and others and you might save me by a worda glance and will not do itis this right in the first place i dont believe you answered i in the second if you will be such a fool i cant hinder it if you affect replied he earnestly to regard as folly the best the strongest the most godlike impulses of our nature i dont believe you
i know you are not the heartless icy being you pretend to beyou had a heart once and gave it to your husband
when you found him utterly unworthy of the treasure you reclaimed it and you will not pretend that you loved that sensual earthlyminded profligate so deeply so devotedly that you can never love another
i know that there are feelings in your nature that have never yet been called forth i know too that in your present neglected lonely state you are and must be miserable
you have it in your power to raise two human beings from a state of actual suffering to such unspeakable beatitude as only generous noble selfforgetting love can give for you can love me if you will you may tell me that you scorn and detest me but since you have set me the example of plain speaking i will answer that i do not believe you but you will not do it
you choose rather to leave us miserable and you coolly tell me it is the will of god that we should remain so
you may call this religion but i call it wild fanaticism there is another life both for you and for me said i
if it be the will of god that we should sow in tears now it is only that we may reap in joy hereafter
it is his will that we should not injure others by the gratification of our own earthly passions and you have a mother and sisters and friends who would be seriously injured by your disgrace and i too have friends whose peace of mind shall never be sacrificed to my enjoyment or yours either with my consent and if i were alone in the world i have still my god and my religion and i would sooner die than disgrace my calling and break my faith with heaven to obtain a few brief years of false and fleeting happinesshappiness sure to end in misery even herefor myself or any other there need be no disgrace no misery or sacrifice in any quarter persisted he
i do not ask you to leave your home or defy the worlds opinion but i need not repeat all his arguments
i refuted them to the best of my power but that power was provokingly small at the moment for i was too much flurried with indignationand even shamethat he should thus dare to address me to retain sufficient command of thought and language to enable me adequately to contend against his powerful sophistries
finding however that he could not be silenced by reason and even covertly exulted in his seeming advantage and ventured to deride those assertions i had not the coolness to prove i changed my course and tried another plan
do you really love me said i seriously pausing and looking him calmly in the face
do i love you cried he
truly i demanded
his countenance brightened he thought his triumph was at hand
he commenced a passionate protestation of the truth and fervour of his attachment which i cut short by another question but is it not a selfish love
have you enough disinterested affection to enable you to sacrifice your own pleasure to mine i would give my life to serve you i dont want your life but have you enough real sympathy for my afflictions to induce you to make an effort to relieve them at the risk of a little discomfort to yourself try me and see if you have never mention this subject again
you cannot recur to it in any way without doubling the weight of those sufferings you so feelingly deplore
i have nothing left me but the solace of a good conscience and a hopeful trust in heaven and you labour continually to rob me of these
if you persist i must regard you as my deadliest foe but hear me a moment no sir
you said you would give your life to serve me i only ask your silence on one particular point
i have spoken plainly and what i say i mean
if you torment me in this way any more i must conclude that your protestations are entirely false and that you hate me in your heart as fervently as you profess to love me he bit his lip and bent his eyes upon the ground in silence for a while
then i must leave you said he at length looking steadily upon me as if with the last hope of detecting some token of irrepressible anguish or dismay awakened by those solemn words
i must leave you
i cannot live here and be for ever silent on the allabsorbing subject of my thoughts and wishes formerly i believe you spent but little of your time at home i answered it will do you no harm to absent yourself again for a whileif that be really necessary if that be really possible he muttered and can you bid me go so coolly
do you really wish it most certainly i do
if you cannot see me without tormenting me as you have lately done i would gladly say farewell and never see you more he made no answer but bending from his horse held out his hand towards me
i looked up at his face and saw therein such a look of genuine agony of soul that whether bitter disappointment or wounded pride or lingering love or burning wrath were uppermost i could not hesitate to put my hand in his as frankly as if i bade a friend farewell
he grasped it very hard and immediately put spurs to his horse and galloped away
very soon after i learned that he was gone to paris where he still is and the longer he stays there the better for me
i thank god for this deliverance
december th the fifth anniversary of my weddingday and i trust the last i shall spend under this roof
my resolution is formed my plan concocted and already partly put in execution
my conscience does not blame me but while the purpose ripens let me beguile a few of these long winter evenings in stating the case for my own satisfaction a dreary amusement enough but having the air of a useful occupation and being pursued as a task it will suit me better than a lighter one
in september quiet grassdale was again alive with a party of ladies and gentlemen so called consisting of the same individuals as those invited the year before last with the addition of two or three others among whom were mrs hargrave and her younger daughter
the gentlemen and lady lowborough were invited for the pleasure and convenience of the host the other ladies i suppose for the sake of appearances and to keep me in check and make me discreet and civil in my demeanour
but the ladies stayed only three weeks the gentlemen with two exceptions above two months for their hospitable entertainer was loth to part with them and be left alone with his bright intellect his stainless conscience and his loved and loving wife
on the day of lady lowboroughs arrival i followed her into her chamber and plainly told her that if i found reason to believe that she still continued her criminal connection with mr huntingdon i should think it my absolute duty to inform her husband of the circumstanceor awaken his suspicions at leasthowever painful it might be or however dreadful the consequences
she was startled at first by the declaration so unexpected and so determinately yet calmly delivered but rallying in a moment she coolly replied that if i saw anything at all reprehensible or suspicious in her conduct she would freely give me leave to tell his lordship all about it
willing to be satisfied with this i left her and certainly i saw nothing thenceforth particularly reprehensible or suspicious in her demeanour towards her host but then i had the other guests to attend to and i did not watch them narrowlyfor to confess the truth i feared to see anything between them
i no longer regarded it as any concern of mine and if it was my duty to enlighten lord lowborough it was a painful duty and i dreaded to be called to perform it
but my fears were brought to an end in a manner i had not anticipated
one evening about a fortnight after the visitors arrival i had retired into the library to snatch a few minutes respite from forced cheerfulness and wearisome discourse for after so long a period of seclusion dreary indeed as i had often found it i could not always bear to be doing violence to my feelings and goading my powers to talk and smile and listen and play the attentive hostess or even the cheerful friend i had just ensconced myself within the bow of the window and was looking out upon the west where the darkening hills rose sharply defined against the clear amber light of evening that gradually blended and faded away into the pure pale blue of the upper sky where one bright star was shining through as if to promisewhen that dying light is gone the world will not be left in darkness and they who trust in god whose minds are unbeclouded by the mists of unbelief and sin are never wholly comfortlesswhen i heard a hurried step approaching and lord lowborough entered
this room was still his favourite resort
he flung the door to with unusual violence and cast his hat aside regardless where it fell
what could be the matter with him
his face was ghastly pale his eyes were fixed upon the ground his teeth clenched his forehead glistened with the dews of agony
it was plain he knew his wrongs at last
unconscious of my presence he began to pace the room in a state of fearful agitation violently wringing his hands and uttering low groans or incoherent ejaculations
i made a movement to let him know that he was not alone but he was too preoccupied to notice it
perhaps while his back was towards me i might cross the room and slip away unobserved
i rose to make the attempt but then he perceived me
he started and stood still a moment then wiped his streaming forehead and advancing towards me with a kind of unnatural composure said in a deep almost sepulchral tonemrs
huntingdon i must leave you tomorrow tomorrow i repeated
i do not ask the cause you know it then and you can be so calm said he surveying me with profound astonishment not unmingled with a kind of resentful bitterness as it appeared to me
i have so long been aware of i paused in time and added of my husbands character that nothing shocks me but thishow long have you been aware of this demanded he laying his clenched hand on the table beside him and looking me keenly and fixedly in the face
i felt like a criminal
not long i answered
you knew it cried he with bitter vehemenceand you did not tell me
you helped to deceive me my lord i did not help to deceive you then why did you not tell me because i knew it would be painful to you
i hoped she would return to her duty and then there would be no need to harrow your feelings with such o god
how long has this been going on
how long has it been mrs huntingdontell mei must know exclaimed with intense and fearful eagerness
two years i believe great heaven
and she has duped me all this time he turned away with a suppressed groan of agony and paced the room again in a paroxysm of renewed agitation
my heart smote me but i would try to console him though i knew not how to attempt it
she is a wicked woman i said
she has basely deceived and betrayed you
she is as little worthy of your regret as she was of your affection
let her injure you no further abstract yourself from her and stand alone and you madam said he sternly arresting himself and turning round upon me you have injured me too by this ungenerous concealment there was a sudden revulsion in my feelings
something rose within me and urged me to resent this harsh return for my heartfelt sympathy and defend myself with answering severity
happily i did not yield to the impulse
i saw his anguish as suddenly smiting his forehead he turned abruptly to the window and looking upward at the placid sky murmured passionately o god that i might dieand felt that to add one drop of bitterness to that already overflowing cup would be ungenerous indeed
and yet i fear there was more coldness than gentleness in the quiet tone of my replyi might offer many excuses that some would admit to be valid but i will not attempt to enumerate them i know them said he hastily you would say that it was no business of yours that i ought to have taken care of myself that if my own blindness has led me into this pit of hell i have no right to blame another for giving me credit for a larger amount of sagacity than i possessed i confess i was wrong continued i without regarding this bitter interruption but whether want of courage or mistaken kindness was the cause of my error i think you blame me too severely
i told lady lowborough two weeks ago the very hour she came that i should certainly think it my duty to inform you if she continued to deceive you she gave me full liberty to do so if i should see anything reprehensible or suspicious in her conduct i have seen nothing and i trusted she had altered her course he continued gazing from the window while i spoke and did not answer but stung by the recollections my words awakened stamped his foot upon the floor ground his teeth and corrugated his brow like one under the influence of acute physical pain
it was wrong it was wrong he muttered at length
nothing can excuse it nothing can atone for itfor nothing can recall those years of cursed credulity nothing obliterate themnothing nothing he repeated in a whisper whose despairing bitterness precluded all resentment
when i put the case to myself i own it was wrong i answered but i can only now regret that i did not see it in this light before and that as you say nothing can recall the past something in my voice or in the spirit of this answer seemed to alter his mood
turning towards me and attentively surveying my face by the dim light he said in a milder tone than he had yet employedyou too have suffered i suppose i suffered much at first when was that two years ago and two years hence you will be as calm as i am now and far far happier i trust for you are a man and free to act as you please something like a smile but a very bitter one crossed his face for a moment
you have not been happy lately he said with a kind of effort to regain composure and a determination to waive the further discussion of his own calamity
happy i repeated almost provoked at such a question
could i be so with such a husband i have noticed a change in your appearance since the first years of your marriage pursued he i observed it toto that infernal demon he muttered between his teeth and he said it was your own sour temper that was eating away your bloom it was making you old and ugly before your time and had already made his fireside as comfortless as a convent cell
you smile mrs huntingdon nothing moves you
i wish my nature were as calm as yours my nature was not originally calm said i
i have learned to appear so by dint of hard lessons and many repeated efforts at this juncture mr hattersley burst into the room
hallo lowborough he beganoh
i beg your pardon he exclaimed on seeing me
i didnt know it was a ttette
cheer up man he continued giving lord lowborough a thump on the back which caused the latter to recoil from him with looks of ineffable disgust and irritation
come i want to speak with you a bit speak then but im not sure it would be quite agreeable to the lady what i have to say then it would not be agreeable to me said his lordship turning to leave the room
yes it would cried the other following him into the hall
if youve the heart of a man it would be the very ticket for you
its just this my lad he continued rather lowering his voice but not enough to prevent me from hearing every word he said though the halfclosed door stood between us
i think youre an illused mannay now dont flare up i dont want to offend you its only my rough way of talking
i must speak right out you know or else not at all and im comestop now
let me explainim come to offer you my services for though huntingdon is my friend hes a devilish scamp as we all know and ill be your friend for the nonce
i know what it is you want to make matters straight its just to exchange a shot with him and then youll feel yourself all right again and if an accident happenswhy thatll be all right too i daresay to a desperate fellow like you
come now give me your hand and dont look so black upon it
name time and place and ill manage the rest that answered the more low deliberate voice of lord lowborough is just the remedy my own heart or the devil within it suggestedto meet him and not to sever without blood
whether i or he should fall or both it would be an inexpressible relief to me if just so
well then no exclaimed his lordship with deep determined emphasis
though i hate him from my heart and should rejoice at any calamity that could befall him ill leave him to god and though i abhor my own life ill leave that too to him that gave it but you see in this case pleaded hattersley ill not hear you exclaimed his companion hastily turning away
not another word
ive enough to do against the fiend within me then youre a whitelivered fool and i wash my hands of you grumbled the tempter as he swung himself round and departed
right right lord lowborough cried i darting out and clasping his burning hand as he was moving away to the stairs
i begin to think the world is not worthy of you not understanding this sudden ebullition he turned upon me with a stare of gloomy bewildered amazement that made me ashamed of the impulse to which i had yielded but soon a more humanised expression dawned upon his countenance and before i could withdraw my hand he pressed it kindly while a gleam of genuine feeling flashed from his eyes as he murmured god help us both amen responded i and we parted
i returned to the drawingroom where doubtless my presence would be expected by most desired by one or two
in the anteroom was mr hattersley railing against lord lowboroughs poltroonery before a select audience viz
mr huntingdon who was lounging against the table exulting in his own treacherous villainy and laughing his victim to scorn and mr grimsby standing by quietly rubbing his hands and chuckling with fiendish satisfaction
in the drawingroom i found lady lowborough evidently in no very enviable state of mind and struggling hard to conceal her discomposure by an overstrained affectation of unusual cheerfulness and vivacity very uncalledfor under the circumstances for she had herself given the company to understand that her husband had received unpleasant intelligence from home which necessitated his immediate departure and that he had suffered it so to bother his mind that it had brought on a bilious headache owing to which and the preparations he judged necessary to hasten his departure she believed they would not have the pleasure of seeing him tonight
however she asserted it was only a business concern and so she did not intend it should trouble her she was just saying this as i entered and she darted upon me such a glance of hardihood and defiance as at once astonished and revolted me
but i am troubled continued she and vexed too for i think it my duty to accompany his lordship and of course i am very sorry to part with all my kind friends so unexpectedly and so soon and yet annabella said esther who was sitting beside her i never saw you in better spirits in my life precisely so my love because i wish to make the best of your society since it appears this is to be the last night i am to enjoy it till heaven knows when and i wish to leave a good impression on you allshe glanced round and seeing her aunts eye fixed upon her rather too scrutinizingly as she probably thought she started up and continued to which end ill give you a songshall i aunt
shall i mrs huntingdon
shall i ladies and gentlemen all
very well
ill do my best to amuse you she and lord lowborough occupied the apartments next to mine
i know not how she passed the night but i lay awake the greater part of it listening to his heavy step pacing monotonously up and down his dressingroom which was nearest my chamber
once i heard him pause and throw something out of the window with a passionate ejaculation and in the morning after they were gone a keenbladed claspknife was found on the grassplot below a razor likewise was snapped in two and thrust deep into the cinders of the grate but partially corroded by the decaying embers
so strong had been the temptation to end his miserable life so determined his resolution to resist it
my heart bled for him as i lay listening to that ceaseless tread
hitherto i had thought too much of myself too little of him now i forgot my own afflictions and thought only of his of the ardent affection so miserably wasted the fond faith so cruelly betrayed theno i will not attempt to enumerate his wrongsbut i hated his wife and my husband more intensely than ever and not for my sake but for his
they departed early in the morning before any one else was down except myself and just as i was leaving my room lord lowborough was descending to take his place in the carriage where his lady was already ensconced and arthur or mr huntingdon as i prefer calling him for the other is my childs name had the gratuitous insolence to come out in his dressinggown to bid his friend goodby
what going already lowborough said he
well goodmorning he smilingly offered his hand
i think the other would have knocked him down had he not instinctively started back before that bony fist quivering with rage and clenched till the knuckles gleamed white and glistening through the skin
looking upon him with a countenance livid with furious hate lord lowborough muttered between his closed teeth a deadly execration he would not have uttered had he been calm enough to choose his words and departed
i call that an unchristian spirit now said the villain
but id never give up an old friend for the sake of a wife
you may have mine if you like and i call that handsome i can do no more than offer restitution can i but lowborough had gained the bottom of the stairs and was now crossing the hall and mr huntingdon leaning over the banisters called out give my love to annabella
and i wish you both a happy journey and withdrew laughing to his chamber
he subsequently expressed himself rather glad she was gone
she was so deuced imperious and exacting said he
now i shall be my own man again and feel rather more at my ease my greatest source of uneasiness in this time of trial was my son whom his father and his fathers friends delighted to encourage in all the embryo vices a little child can show and to instruct in all the evil habits he could acquirein a word to make a man of him was one of their staple amusements and i need say no more to justify my alarm on his account and my determination to deliver him at any hazard from the hands of such instructors
i first attempted to keep him always with me or in the nursery and gave rachel particular injunctions never to let him come down to dessert as long as these gentlemen stayed but it was no use these orders were immediately countermanded and overruled by his father he was not going to have the little fellow moped to death between an old nurse and a cursed fool of a mother
so the little fellow came down every evening in spite of his cross mamma and learned to tipple wine like papa to swear like mr hattersley and to have his own way like a man and sent mamma to the devil when she tried to prevent him
to see such things done with the roguish navet of that pretty little child and hear such things spoken by that small infantile voice was as peculiarly piquant and irresistibly droll to them as it was inexpressibly distressing and painful to me and when he had set the table in a roar he would look round delightedly upon them all and add his shrill laugh to theirs
but if that beaming blue eye rested on me its light would vanish for a moment and he would say in some concern mamma why dont you laugh
make her laugh papashe never will hence was i obliged to stay among these human brutes watching an opportunity to get my child away from them instead of leaving them immediately after the removal of the cloth as i should always otherwise have done
he was never willing to go and i frequently had to carry him away by force for which he thought me very cruel and unjust and sometimes his father would insist upon my letting him remain and then i would leave him to his kind friends and retire to indulge my bitterness and despair alone or to rack my brains for a remedy to this great evil
but here again i must do mr hargrave the justice to acknowledge that i never saw him laugh at the childs misdemeanours nor heard him utter a word of encouragement to his aspirations after manly accomplishments
but when anything very extraordinary was said or done by the infant profligate i noticed at times a peculiar expression in his face that i could neither interpret nor define a slight twitching about the muscles of the mouth a sudden flash in the eye as he darted a sudden glance at the child and then at me and then i could fancy there arose a gleam of hard keen sombre satisfaction in his countenance at the look of impotent wrath and anguish he was too certain to behold in mine
but on one occasion when arthur had been behaving particularly ill and mr huntingdon and his guests had been particularly provoking and insulting to me in their encouragement of him and i particularly anxious to get him out of the room and on the very point of demeaning myself by a burst of uncontrollable passionmr
hargrave suddenly rose from his seat with an aspect of stern determination lifted the child from his fathers knee where he was sitting halftipsy cocking his head and laughing at me and execrating me with words he little knew the meaning of handed him out of the room and setting him down in the hall held the door open for me gravely bowed as i withdrew and closed it after me
i heard high words exchanged between him and his already halfinebriated host as i departed leading away my bewildered and disconcerted boy
but this should not continue my child must not be abandoned to this corruption better far that he should live in poverty and obscurity with a fugitive mother than in luxury and affluence with such a father
these guests might not be with us long but they would return again and he the most injurious of the whole his childs worst enemy would still remain
i could endure it for myself but for my son it must be borne no longer the worlds opinion and the feelings of my friends must be alike unheeded here at leastalike unable to deter me from my duty
but where should i find an asylum and how obtain subsistence for us both
oh i would take my precious charge at early dawn take the coach to m flee to the port of cross the atlantic and seek a quiet humble home in new england where i would support myself and him by the labour of my hands
the palette and the easel my darling playmates once must be my sober toilfellows now
but was i sufficiently skilful as an artist to obtain my livelihood in a strange land without friends and without recommendation
no i must wait a little i must labour hard to improve my talent and to produce something worth while as a specimen of my powers something to speak favourably for me whether as an actual painter or a teacher
brilliant success of course i did not look for but some degree of security from positive failure was indispensable i must not take my son to starve
and then i must have money for the journey the passage and some little to support us in our retreat in case i should be unsuccessful at first and not too little either for who could tell how long i might have to struggle with the indifference or neglect of others or my own inexperience or inability to suit their tastes
what should i do then
apply to my brother and explain my circumstances and my resolves to him
no no even if i told him all my grievances which i should be very reluctant to do he would be certain to disapprove of the step it would seem like madness to him as it would to my uncle and aunt or to milicent
no i must have patience and gather a hoard of my own
rachel should be my only confidantei thought i could persuade her into the scheme and she should help me first to find out a picturedealer in some distant town then through her means i would privately sell what pictures i had on hand that would do for such a purpose and some of those i should thereafter paint
besides this i would contrive to dispose of my jewels not the family jewels but the few i brought with me from home and those my uncle gave me on my marriage
a few months arduous toil might well be borne by me with such an end in view and in the interim my son could not be much more injured than he was already
having formed this resolution i immediately set to work to accomplish it i might possibly have been induced to wax cool upon it afterwards or perhaps to keep weighing the pros and cons in my mind till the latter overbalanced the former and i was driven to relinquish the project altogether or delay the execution of it to an indefinite period had not something occurred to confirm me in that determination to which i still adhere which i still think i did well to form and shall do better to execute
since lord lowboroughs departure i had regarded the library as entirely my own a secure retreat at all hours of the day
none of our gentlemen had the smallest pretensions to a literary taste except mr hargrave and he at present was quite contented with the newspapers and periodicals of the day
and if by any chance he should look in here i felt assured he would soon depart on seeing me for instead of becoming less cool and distant towards me he had become decidedly more so since the departure of his mother and sisters which was just what i wished
here then i set up my easel and here i worked at my canvas from daylight till dusk with very little intermission saving when pure necessity or my duties to little arthur called me away for i still thought proper to devote some portion of every day exclusively to his instruction and amusement
but contrary to my expectation on the third morning while i was thus employed mr hargrave did look in and did not immediately withdraw on seeing me
he apologized for his intrusion and said he was only come for a book but when he had got it he condescended to cast a glance over my picture
being a man of taste he had something to say on this subject as well as another and having modestly commented on it without much encouragement from me he proceeded to expatiate on the art in general
receiving no encouragement in that either he dropped it but did not depart
you dont give us much of your company mrs huntingdon observed he after a brief pause during which i went on coolly mixing and tempering my colours and i cannot wonder at it for you must be heartily sick of us all
i myself am so thoroughly ashamed of my companions and so weary of their irrational conversation and pursuitsnow that there is no one to humanize them and keep them in check since you have justly abandoned us to our own devicesthat i think i shall presently withdraw from amongst them probably within this week and i cannot suppose you will regret my departure he paused
i did not answer
probably he added with a smile your only regret on the subject will be that i do not take all my companions along with me
i flatter myself at times that though among them i am not of them but it is natural that you should be glad to get rid of me
i may regret this but i cannot blame you for it i shall not rejoice at your departure for you can conduct yourself like a gentleman said i thinking it but right to make some acknowledgment for his good behaviour but i must confess i shall rejoice to bid adieu to the rest inhospitable as it may appear no one can blame you for such an avowal replied he gravely not even the gentlemen themselves i imagine
ill just tell you he continued as if actuated by a sudden resolution what was said last night in the diningroom after you left us perhaps you will not mind it as youre so very philosophical on certain points he added with a slight sneer
they were talking about lord lowborough and his delectable lady the cause of whose sudden departure is no secret amongst them and her character is so well known to them all that nearly related to me as she is i could not attempt to defend it
curse me he muttered par parenthse if i dont have vengeance for this
if the villain must disgrace the family must he blazon it abroad to every lowbred knave of his acquaintance
i beg your pardon mrs huntingdon
well they were talking of these things and some of them remarked that as she was separated from her husband he might see her again when he pleased thank you said he ive had enough of her for the present ill not trouble to see her unless she comes to me then what do you mean to do huntingdon when were gone said ralph hattersley
do you mean to turn from the error of your ways and be a good husband a good father and so forth as i do when i get shut of you and all these rollicking devils you call your friends
i think its time and your wife is fifty times too good for you you know and he added some praise of you which you would not thank me for repeating nor him for uttering proclaiming it aloud as he did without delicacy or discrimination in an audience where it seemed profanation to utter your name himself utterly incapable of understanding or appreciating your real excellences
huntingdon meanwhile sat quietly drinking his wineor looking smilingly into his glass and offering no interruption or reply till hattersley shouted outdo you hear me man yes go on said he
nay ive done replied the other i only want to know if you intend to take my advice what advice to turn over a new leaf you doubledyed scoundrel shouted ralph and beg your wifes pardon and be a good boy for the future my wife
what wife
i have no wife replied huntingdon looking innocently up from his glass or if i have look you gentlemen i value her so highly that any one among you that can fancy her may have her and welcome you may by jove and my blessing into the bargain ihemsomeone asked if he really meant what he said upon which he solemnly swore he did and no mistake
what do you think of that mrs huntingdon asked mr hargrave after a short pause during which i had felt he was keenly examining my halfaverted face
i say replied i calmly that what he prizes so lightly will not be long in his possession you cannot mean that you will break your heart and die for the detestable conduct of an infamous villain like that by no means my heart is too thoroughly dried to be broken in a hurry and i mean to live as long as i can will you leave him then yes when and how asked he eagerly
when i am ready and how i can manage it most effectually but your child my child goes with me he will not allow it i shall not ask him ah then it is a secret flight you meditate
but with whom mrs huntingdon with my son and possibly his nurse aloneand unprotected
but where can you go
what can you do
he will follow you and bring you back i have laid my plans too well for that
let me once get clear of grassdale and i shall consider myself safe mr hargrave advanced one step towards me looked me in the face and drew in his breath to speak but that look that heightened colour that sudden sparkle of the eye made my blood rise in wrath i abruptly turned away and snatching up my brush began to dash away at my canvas with rather too much energy for the good of the picture
mrs
huntingdon said he with bitter solemnity you are cruelcruel to mecruel to yourself mr
hargrave remember your promise i must speak my heart will burst if i dont
i have been silent long enough and you must hear me cried he boldly intercepting my retreat to the door
you tell me you owe no allegiance to your husband he openly declares himself weary of you and calmly gives you up to anybody that will take you you are about to leave him no one will believe that you go alone all the world will say she has left him at last and who can wonder at it
few can blame her fewer still can pity him but who is the companion of her flight thus you will have no credit for your virtue if you call it such even your best friends will not believe in it because it is monstrous and not to be credited but by those who suffer from the effects of it such cruel torments that they know it to be indeed reality
but what can you do in the cold rough world alone
you a young and inexperienced woman delicately nurtured and utterly in a word you would advise me to stay where i am interrupted i
well ill see about it by all means leave him cried he earnestly but not alone
helen
let me protect you never
while heaven spares my reason replied i snatching away the hand he had presumed to seize and press between his own
but he was in for it now he had fairly broken the barrier he was completely roused and determined to hazard all for victory
i must not be denied exclaimed he vehemently and seizing both my hands he held them very tight but dropped upon his knee and looked up in my face with a halfimploring halfimperious gaze
you have no reason now you are flying in the face of heavens decrees
god has designed me to be your comfort and protectori feel it i know it as certainly as if a voice from heaven declared ye twain shall be one fleshand you spurn me from you let me go mr hargrave said i sternly
but he only tightened his grasp
let me go i repeated quivering with indignation
his face was almost opposite the window as he knelt
with a slight start i saw him glance towards it and then a gleam of malicious triumph lit up his countenance
looking over my shoulder i beheld a shadow just retiring round the corner
that is grimsby said he deliberately
he will report what he has seen to huntingdon and all the rest with such embellishments as he thinks proper
he has no love for you mrs huntingdonno reverence for your sex no belief in virtue no admiration for its image
he will give such a version of this story as will leave no doubt at all about your character in the minds of those who hear it
your fair fame is gone and nothing that i or you can say can ever retrieve it
but give me the power to protect you and show me the villain that dares to insult no one has ever dared to insult me as you are doing now said i at length releasing my hands and recoiling from him
i do not insult you cried he i worship you
you are my angel my divinity
i lay my powers at your feet and you must and shall accept them he exclaimed impetuously starting to his feet
i will be your consoler and defender
and if your conscience upbraid you for it say i overcame you and you could not choose but yield i never saw a man go terribly excited
he precipitated himself towards me
i snatched up my paletteknife and held it against him
this startled him he stood and gazed at me in astonishment i daresay i looked as fierce and resolute as he
i moved to the bell and put my hand upon the cord
this tamed him still more
with a halfauthoritative halfdeprecating wave of the hand he sought to deter me from ringing
stand off then said i he stepped back
and listen to me
i dont like you i continued as deliberately and emphatically as i could to give the greater efficacy to my words and if i were divorced from my husband or if he were dead i would not marry you
there now
i hope youre satisfied his face grew blanched with anger
i am satisfied he replied with bitter emphasis that you are the most coldhearted unnatural ungrateful woman i ever yet beheld ungrateful sir ungrateful no mr hargrave i am not
for all the good you ever did me or ever wished to do i most sincerely thank you for all the evil you have done me and all you would have done i pray god to pardon you and make you of a better mind here the door was thrown open and messrs huntingdon and hattersley appeared without
the latter remained in the hall busy with his ramrod and his gun the former walked in and stood with his back to the fire surveying mr hargrave and me particularly the former with a smile of insupportable meaning accompanied as it was by the impudence of his brazen brow and the sly malicious twinkle of his eye
well sir said hargrave interrogatively and with the air of one prepared to stand on the defensive
well sir returned his host
we want to know if you are at liberty to join us in a go at the pheasants walter interposed hattersley from without
come
there shall be nothing shot besides except a puss or two ill vouch for that walter did not answer but walked to the window to collect his faculties
arthur uttered a low whistle and followed him with his eyes
a slight flush of anger rose to hargraves cheek but in a moment he turned calmly round and said carelessly i came here to bid farewell to mrs huntingdon and tell her i must go tomorrow humph
youre mighty sudden in your resolution
what takes you off so soon may i ask business returned he repelling the others incredulous sneer with a glance of scornful defiance
very good was the reply and hargrave walked away
thereupon mr huntingdon gathering his coatlaps under his arms and setting his shoulder against the mantelpiece turned to me and addressing me in a low voice scarcely above his breath poured forth a volley of the vilest and grossest abuse it was possible for the imagination to conceive or the tongue to utter
i did not attempt to interrupt him but my spirit kindled within me and when he had done i replied if your accusation were true mr huntingdon how dare you blame me shes hit it by jove cried hattersley rearing his gun against the wall and stepping into the room he took his precious friend by the arm and attempted to drag him away
come my lad he muttered true or false youve no right to blame her you know nor him either after what you said last night
so come along there was something implied here that i could not endure
dare you suspect me mr hattersley said i almost beside myself with fury
nay nay i suspect nobody
its all right its all right
so come along huntingdon you blackguard she cant deny it cried the gentleman thus addressed grinning in mingled rage and triumph
she cant deny it if her life depended on it and muttering some more abusive language he walked into the hall and took up his hat and gun from the table
i scorn to justify myself to you said i
but you turning to hattersley if you presume to have any doubts on the subject ask mr hargrave at this they simultaneously burst into a rude laugh that made my whole frame tingle to the fingers ends
where is he
ill ask him myself said i advancing towards them
suppressing a new burst of merriment hattersley pointed to the outer door
it was half open
his brotherinlaw was standing on the front without
mr
hargrave will you please to step this way said i
he turned and looked at me in grave surprise
step this way if you please i repeated in so determined a manner that he could not or did not choose to resist its authority
somewhat reluctantly he ascended the steps and advanced a pace or two into the hall
and tell those gentlemen i continuedthese men whether or not i yielded to your solicitations i dont understand you mrs huntingdon you do understand me sir and i charge you upon your honour as a gentleman if you have any to answer truly
did i or did i not no muttered he turning away
speak up sir they cant hear you
did i grant your request
you did not no ill be sworn she didnt said hattersley or hed never look so black im willing to grant you the satisfaction of a gentleman huntingdon said mr hargrave calmly addressing his host but with a bitter sneer upon his countenance
go to the deuce replied the latter with an impatient jerk of the head
hargrave withdrew with a look of cold disdain sayingyou know where to find me should you feel disposed to send a friend muttered oaths and curses were all the answer this intimation obtained
now huntingdon you see said hattersley
clear as the day i dont care what he sees said i or what he imagines but you mr hattersley when you hear my name belied and slandered will you defend it i will i instantly departed and shut myself into the library
what could possess me to make such a request of such a man i cannot tell but drowning men catch at straws they had driven me desperate between them i hardly knew what i said
there was no other to preserve my name from being blackened and aspersed among this nest of boon companions and through them perhaps into the world and beside my abandoned wretch of a husband the base malignant grimsby and the false villain hargrave this boorish ruffian coarse and brutal as he was shone like a glowworm in the dark among its fellow worms
what a scene was this
could i ever have imagined that i should be doomed to bear such insults under my own roofto hear such things spoken in my presence nay spoken to me and of me and by those who arrogated to themselves the name of gentlemen
and could i have imagined that i should have been able to endure it as calmly and to repel their insults as firmly and as boldly as i had done
a hardness such as this is taught by rough experience and despair alone
such thoughts as these chased one another through my mind as i paced to and fro the room and longedoh how i longedto take my child and leave them now without an hours delay
but it could not be there was work before me hard work that must be done
then let me do it said i and lose not a moment in vain repinings and idle chafings against my fate and those who influence it and conquering my agitation with a powerful effort i immediately resumed my task and laboured hard all day
mr hargrave did depart on the morrow and i have never seen him since
the others stayed on for two or three weeks longer but i kept aloof from them as much as possible and still continued my labour and have continued it with almost unabated ardour to the present day
i soon acquainted rachel with my design confiding all my motives and intentions to her ear and much to my agreeable surprise found little difficulty in persuading her to enter into my views
she is a sober cautious woman but she so hates her master and so loves her mistress and her nursling that after several ejaculations a few faint objections and many tears and lamentations that i should be brought to such a pass she applauded my resolution and consented to aid me with all her might on one condition only that she might share my exile otherwise she was utterly inexorable regarding it as perfect madness for me and arthur to go alone
with touching generosity she modestly offered to aid me with her little hoard of savings hoping i would excuse her for the liberty but really if i would do her the favour to accept it as a loan she would be very happy of course i could not think of such a thing but now thank heaven i have gathered a little hoard of my own and my preparations are so far advanced that i am looking forward to a speedy emancipation
only let the stormy severity of this winter weather be somewhat abated and then some morning mr huntingdon will come down to a solitary breakfasttable and perhaps be clamouring through the house for his invisible wife and child when they are some fifty miles on their way to the western world or it may be more for we shall leave him hours before the dawn and it is not probable he will discover the loss of both until the day is far advanced
i am fully alive to the evils that may and must result upon the step i am about to take but i never waver in my resolution because i never forget my son
it was only this morning while i pursued my usual employment he was sitting at my feet quietly playing with the shreds of canvas i had thrown upon the carpet but his mind was otherwise occupied for in a while he looked up wistfully in my face and gravely askedmamma why are you wicked who told you i was wicked love rachel no arthur rachel never said so i am certain well then it was papa replied he thoughtfully
then after a reflective pause he added at least ill tell you how it was i got to know when im with papa if i say mamma wants me or mamma says im not to do something that he tells me to do he always says mamma be damned and rachel says its only wicked people that are damned
so mamma thats why i think you must be wicked and i wish you wouldnt my dear child i am not
those are bad words and wicked people often say them of others better than themselves
those words cannot make people be damned nor show that they deserve it
god will judge us by our own thoughts and deeds not by what others say about us
and when you hear such words spoken arthur remember never to repeat them it is wicked to say such things of others not to have them said against you then its papa thats wicked said he ruefully
papa is wrong to say such things and you will be very wrong to imitate him now that you know better what is imitate to do as he does does he know better perhaps he does but that is nothing to you if he doesnt you ought to tell him mamma i have told him the little moralist paused and pondered
i tried in vain to divert his mind from the subject
im sorry papas wicked said he mournfully at length for i dont want him to go to hell and so saying he burst into tears
i consoled him with the hope that perhaps his papa would alter and become good before he died but is it not time to deliver him from such a parent
january th while writing the above yesterday evening i sat in the drawingroom
mr huntingdon was present but as i thought asleep on the sofa behind me
he had risen however unknown to me and actuated by some base spirit of curiosity been looking over my shoulder for i know not how long for when i had laid aside my pen and was about to close the book he suddenly placed his hand upon it and sayingwith your leave my dear ill have a look at this forcibly wrested it from me and drawing a chair to the table composedly sat down to examine it turning back leaf after leaf to find an explanation of what he had read
unluckily for me he was more sober that night than he usually is at such an hour
of course i did not leave him to pursue this occupation in quiet i made several attempts to snatch the book from his hands but he held it too firmly for that i upbraided him in bitterness and scorn for his mean and dishonourable conduct but that had no effect upon him and finally i extinguished both the candles but he only wheeled round to the fire and raising a blaze sufficient for his purposes calmly continued the investigation
i had serious thoughts of getting a pitcher of water and extinguishing that light too but it was evident his curiosity was too keenly excited to be quenched by that and the more i manifested my anxiety to baffle his scrutiny the greater would be his determination to persist in it besides it was too late
it seems very interesting love said he lifting his head and turning to where i stood wringing my hands in silent rage and anguish but its rather long ill look at it some other time and meanwhile ill trouble you for your keys my dear what keys the keys of your cabinet desk drawers and whatever else you possess said he rising and holding out his hand
ive not got them i replied
the key of my desk in fact was at that moment in the lock and the others were attached to it
then you must send for them said he and if that old devil rachel doesnt immediately deliver them up she tramps bag and baggage tomorrow she doesnt know where they are i answered quietly placing my hand upon them and taking them from the desk as i thought unobserved
i know but i shall not give them up without a reason and i know too said he suddenly seizing my closed hand and rudely abstracting them from it
he then took up one of the candles and relighted it by thrusting it into the fire
now then sneered he we must have a confiscation of property
but first let us take a peep into the studio and putting the keys into his pocket he walked into the library
i followed whether with the dim idea of preventing mischief or only to know the worst i can hardly tell
my painting materials were laid together on the corner table ready for tomorrows use and only covered with a cloth
he soon spied them out and putting down the candle deliberately proceeded to cast them into the fire palette paints bladders pencils brushes varnish i saw them all consumed the paletteknives snapped in two the oil and turpentine sent hissing and roaring up the chimney
he then rang the bell
benson take those things away said he pointing to the easel canvas and stretcher and tell the housemaid she may kindle the fire with them your mistress wont want them any more benson paused aghast and looked at me
take them away benson said i and his master muttered an oath
and this and all sir said the astonished servant referring to the halffinished picture
that and all replied the master and the things were cleared away
mr huntingdon then went upstairs
i did not attempt to follow him but remained seated in the armchair speechless tearless and almost motionless till he returned about halfanhour after and walking up to me held the candle in my face and peered into my eyes with looks and laughter too insulting to be borne
with a sudden stroke of my hand i dashed the candle to the floor
hallo muttered he starting back shes the very devil for spite
did ever any mortal see such eyesthey shine in the dark like a cats
oh youre a sweet one so saying he gathered up the candle and the candlestick
the former being broken as well as extinguished he rang for another
benson your mistress has broken the candle bring another you expose yourself finely observed i as the man departed
i didnt say id broken it did i returned he
he then threw my keys into my lap sayingthere
youll find nothing gone but your money and the jewels and a few little trifles i thought it advisable to take into my own possession lest your mercantile spirit should be tempted to turn them into gold
ive left you a few sovereigns in your purse which i expect to last you through the month at all events when you want more you will be so good as to give me an account of how thats spent
i shall put you upon a small monthly allowance in future for your own private expenses and you neednt trouble yourself any more about my concerns i shall look out for a steward my deari wont expose you to the temptation
and as for the household matters mrs greaves must be very particular in keeping her accounts we must go upon an entirely new plan what great discovery have you made now mr huntingdon
have i attempted to defraud you not in money matters exactly it seems but its best to keep out of the way of temptation here benson entered with the candles and there followed a brief interval of silence i sitting still in my chair and he standing with his back to the fire silently triumphing in my despair
and so said he at length you thought to disgrace me did you by running away and turning artist and supporting yourself by the labour of your hands forsooth
and you thought to rob me of my son too and bring him up to be a dirty yankee tradesman or a low beggarly painter yes to obviate his becoming such a gentleman as his father its well you couldnt keep your own secretha ha
its well these women must be blabbing
if they havent a friend to talk to they must whisper their secrets to the fishes or write them on the sand or something and its well too i wasnt over full tonight now i think of it or i might have snoozed away and never dreamt of looking what my sweet lady was about or i might have lacked the sense or the power to carry my point like a man as i have done leaving him to his selfcongratulations i rose to secure my manuscript for i now remembered it had been left upon the drawingroom table and i determined if possible to save myself the humiliation of seeing it in his hands again
i could not bear the idea of his amusing himself over my secret thoughts and recollections though to be sure he would find little good of himself therein indited except in the former part and oh i would sooner burn it all than he should read what i had written when i was such a fool as to love him
and bytheby cried he as i was leaving the room youd better tell that dd old sneak of a nurse to keep out of my way for a day or two id pay her her wages and send her packing tomorrow but i know shed do more mischief out of the house than in it and as i departed he went on cursing and abusing my faithful friend and servant with epithets i will not defile this paper with repeating
i went to her as soon as i had put away my book and told her how our project was defeated
she was as much distressed and horrified as i wasand more so than i was that night for i was partly stunned by the blow and partly excited and supported against it by the bitterness of my wrath
but in the morning when i woke without that cheering hope that had been my secret comfort and support so long and all this day when i have wandered about restless and objectless shunning my husband shrinking even from my child knowing that i am unfit to be his teacher or companion hoping nothing for his future life and fervently wishing he had never been borni felt the full extent of my calamity and i feel it now
i know that day after day such feelings will return upon me
i am a slavea prisonerbut that is nothing if it were myself alone i would not complain but i am forbidden to rescue my son from ruin and what was once my only consolation is become the crowning source of my despair
have i no faith in god
i try to look to him and raise my heart to heaven but it will cleave to the dust
i can only say he hath hedged me about that i cannot get out he hath made my chain heavy
he hath filled me with bitternesshe hath made me drunken with wormwood i forget to add but though he cause grief yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies
for he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men i ought to think of this and if there be nothing but sorrow for me in this world what is the longest life of misery to a whole eternity of peace
and for my little arthurhas he no friend but me
who was it said it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish march thhaving now got rid of mr huntingdon for a season my spirits begin to revive
he left me early in february and the moment he was gone i breathed again and felt my vital energy return not with the hope of escapehe has taken care to leave me no visible chance of thatbut with a determination to make the best of existing circumstances
here was arthur left to me at last and rousing from my despondent apathy i exerted all my powers to eradicate the weeds that had been fostered in his infant mind and sow again the good seed they had rendered unproductive
thank heaven it is not a barren or a stony soil if weeds spring fast there so do better plants
his apprehensions are more quick his heart more overflowing with affection than ever his fathers could have been and it is no hopeless task to bend him to obedience and win him to love and know his own true friend as long as there is no one to counteract my efforts
i had much trouble at first in breaking him of those evil habits his father had taught him to acquire but already that difficulty is nearly vanquished now bad language seldom defiles his mouth and i have succeeded in giving him an absolute disgust for all intoxicating liquors which i hope not even his father or his fathers friends will be able to overcome
he was inordinately fond of them for so young a creature and remembering my unfortunate father as well as his i dreaded the consequences of such a taste
but if i had stinted him in his usual quantity of wine or forbidden him to taste it altogether that would only have increased his partiality for it and made him regard it as a greater treat than ever
i therefore gave him quite as much as his father was accustomed to allow him as much indeed as he desired to havebut into every glass i surreptitiously introduced a small quantity of tartaremetic just enough to produce inevitable nausea and depression without positive sickness
finding such disagreeable consequences invariably to result from this indulgence he soon grew weary of it but the more he shrank from the daily treat the more i pressed it upon him till his reluctance was strengthened to perfect abhorrence
when he was thoroughly disgusted with every kind of wine i allowed him at his own request to try brandyandwater and then ginandwater for the little toper was familiar with them all and i was determined that all should be equally hateful to him
this i have now effected and since he declares that the taste the smell the sight of any one of them is sufficient to make him sick i have given up teasing him about them except now and then as objects of terror in cases of misbehaviour
arthur if youre not a good boy i shall give you a glass of wine or now arthur if you say that again you shall have some brandyandwater is as good as any other threat and once or twice when he was sick i have obliged the poor child to swallow a little wineandwater without the tartaremetic by way of medicine and this practice i intend to continue for some time to come not that i think it of any real service in a physical sense but because i am determined to enlist all the powers of association in my service i wish this aversion to be so deeply grounded in his nature that nothing in afterlife may be able to overcome it
thus i flatter myself i shall secure him from this one vice and for the rest if on his fathers return i find reason to apprehend that my good lessons will be all destroyedif mr huntingdon commence again the game of teaching the child to hate and despise his mother and emulate his fathers wickednessi will yet deliver my son from his hands
i have devised another scheme that might be resorted to in such a case and if i could but obtain my brothers consent and assistance i should not doubt of its success
the old hall where he and i were born and where our mother died is not now inhabited nor yet quite sunk into decay as i believe
now if i could persuade him to have one or two rooms made habitable and to let them to me as a stranger i might live there with my child under an assumed name and still support myself by my favourite art
he should lend me the money to begin with and i would pay him back and live in lowly independence and strict seclusion for the house stands in a lonely place and the neighbourhood is thinly inhabited and he himself should negotiate the sale of my pictures for me
i have arranged the whole plan in my head and all i want is to persuade frederick to be of the same mind as myself
he is coming to see me soon and then i will make the proposal to him having first enlightened him upon my circumstances sufficiently to excuse the project
already i believe he knows much more of my situation than i have told him
i can tell this by the air of tender sadness pervading his letters and by the fact of his so seldom mentioning my husband and generally evincing a kind of covert bitterness when he does refer to him as well as by the circumstance of his never coming to see me when mr huntingdon is at home
but he has never openly expressed any disapprobation of him or sympathy for me he has never asked any questions or said anything to invite my confidence
had he done so i should probably have had but few concealments from him
perhaps he feels hurt at my reserve
he is a strange being i wish we knew each other better
he used to spend a month at staningley every year before i was married but since our fathers death i have only seen him once when he came for a few days while mr huntingdon was away
he shall stay many days this time and there shall be more candour and cordiality between us than ever there was before since our early childhood
my heart clings to him more than ever and my soul is sick of solitude
april thhe is come and gone
he would not stay above a fortnight
the time passed quickly but very very happily and it has done me good
i must have a bad disposition for my misfortunes have soured and embittered me exceedingly i was beginning insensibly to cherish very unamiable feelings against my fellowmortals the male part of them especially but it is a comfort to see there is at least one among them worthy to be trusted and esteemed and doubtless there are more though i have never known them unless i except poor lord lowborough and he was bad enough in his day
but what would frederick have been if he had lived in the world and mingled from his childhood with such men as these of my acquaintance
and what will arthur be with all his natural sweetness of disposition if i do not save him from that world and those companions
i mentioned my fears to frederick and introduced the subject of my plan of rescue on the evening after his arrival when i presented my little son to his uncle
he is like you frederick said i in some of his moods i sometimes think he resembles you more than his father and i am glad of it you flatter me helen replied he stroking the childs soft wavy locks
no you will think it no compliment when i tell you i would rather have him to resemble benson than his father he slightly elevated his eyebrows but said nothing
do you know what sort of man mr huntingdon is said i
i think i have an idea have you so clear an idea that you can hear without surprise or disapproval that i meditate escaping with that child to some secret asylum where we can live in peace and never see him again is it really so if you have not continued i ill tell you something more about him and i gave a sketch of his general conduct and a more particular account of his behaviour with regard to his child and explained my apprehensions on the latters account and my determination to deliver him from his fathers influence
frederick was exceedingly indignant against mr huntingdon and very much grieved for me but still he looked upon my project as wild and impracticable
he deemed my fears for arthur disproportioned to the circumstances and opposed so many objections to my plan and devised so many milder methods for ameliorating my condition that i was obliged to enter into further details to convince him that my husband was utterly incorrigible and that nothing could persuade him to give up his son whatever became of me he being as fully determined the child should not leave him as i was not to leave the child and that in fact nothing would answer but this unless i fled the country as i had intended before
to obviate that he at length consented to have one wing of the old hall put into a habitable condition as a place of refuge against a time of need but hoped i would not take advantage of it unless circumstances should render it really necessary which i was ready enough to promise for though for my own sake such a hermitage appears like paradise itself compared with my present situation yet for my friends sakes for milicent and esther my sisters in heart and affection for the poor tenants of grassdale and above all for my aunt i will stay if i possibly can
july thmrs
hargrave and her daughter are come back from london
esther is full of her first season in town but she is still heartwhole and unengaged
her mother sought out an excellent match for her and even brought the gentleman to lay his heart and fortune at her feet but esther had the audacity to refuse the noble gifts
he was a man of good family and large possessions but the naughty girl maintained he was old as adam ugly as sin and hateful asone who shall be nameless
but indeed i had a hard time of it said she mamma was very greatly disappointed at the failure of her darling project and very very angry at my obstinate resistance to her will and is so still but i cant help it
and walter too is so seriously displeased at my perversity and absurd caprice as he calls it that i fear he will never forgive mei did not think he could be so unkind as he has lately shown himself
but milicent begged me not to yield and im sure mrs huntingdon if you had seen the man they wanted to palm upon me you would have advised me not to take him too i should have done so whether i had seen him or not said i it is enough that you dislike him i knew you would say so though mamma affirmed you would be quite shocked at my undutiful conduct
you cant imagine how she lectures me i am disobedient and ungrateful i am thwarting her wishes wronging my brother and making myself a burden on her hands
i sometimes fear shell overcome me after all
i have a strong will but so has she and when she says such bitter things it provokes me to such a pass that i feel inclined to do as she bids me and then break my heart and say there mamma its all your fault pray dont said i
obedience from such a motive would be positive wickedness and certain to bring the punishment it deserves
stand firm and your mamma will soon relinquish her persecution and the gentleman himself will cease to pester you with his addresses if he finds them steadily rejected oh no
mamma will weary all about her before she tires herself with her exertions and as for mr oldfield she has given him to understand that i have refused his offer not from any dislike of his person but merely because i am giddy and young and cannot at present reconcile myself to the thoughts of marriage under any circumstances but by next season she has no doubt i shall have more sense and hopes my girlish fancies will be worn away
so she has brought me home to school me into a proper sense of my duty against the time comes round again
indeed i believe she will not put herself to the expense of taking me up to london again unless i surrender she cannot afford to take me to town for pleasure and nonsense she says and it is not every rich gentleman that will consent to take me without a fortune whatever exalted ideas i may have of my own attractions well esther i pity you but still i repeat stand firm
you might as well sell yourself to slavery at once as marry a man you dislike
if your mother and brother are unkind to you you may leave them but remember you are bound to your husband for life but i cannot leave them unless i get married and i cannot get married if nobody sees me
i saw one or two gentlemen in london that i might have liked but they were younger sons and mamma would not let me get to know themone especially who i believe rather liked mebut she threw every possible obstacle in the way of our better acquaintance
wasnt it provoking i have no doubt you would feel it so but it is possible that if you married him you might have more reason to regret it hereafter than if you married mr oldfield
when i tell you not to marry without love i do not advise you to marry for love alone there are many many other things to be considered
keep both heart and hand in your own possession till you see good reason to part with them and if such an occasion should never present itself comfort your mind with this reflection that though in single life your joys may not be very many your sorrows at least will not be more than you can bear
marriage may change your circumstances for the better but in my private opinion it is far more likely to produce a contrary result so thinks milicent but allow me to say i think otherwise
if i thought myself doomed to oldmaidenhood i should cease to value my life
the thoughts of living on year after year at the grovea hangeron upon mamma and walter a mere cumberer of the ground now that i know in what light they would regard it is perfectly intolerable i would rather run away with the butler your circumstances are peculiar i allow but have patience love do nothing rashly
remember you are not yet nineteen and many years are yet to pass before any one can set you down as an old maid you cannot tell what providence may have in store for you
and meantime remember you have a right to the protection and support of your mother and brother however they may seem to grudge it you are so grave mrs huntingdon said esther after a pause
when milicent uttered the same discouraging sentiments concerning marriage i asked if she was happy she said she was but i only half believed her and now i must put the same question to you it is a very impertinent question laughed i from a young girl to a married woman so many years her senior and i shall not answer it pardon me dear madam said she laughingly throwing herself into my arms and kissing me with playful affection but i felt a tear on my neck as she dropped her head on my bosom and continued with an odd mixture of sadness and levity timidity and audacityi know you are not so happy as i mean to be for you spend half your life alone at grassdale while mr huntingdon goes about enjoying himself where and how he pleases
i shall expect my husband to have no pleasures but what he shares with me and if his greatest pleasure of all is not the enjoyment of my company why it will be the worse for him thats all if such are your expectations of matrimony esther you must indeed be careful whom you marryor rather you must avoid it altogether september stno mr huntingdon yet
perhaps he will stay among his friends till christmas and then next spring he will be off again
if he continue this plan i shall be able to stay at grassdale well enoughthat is i shall be able to stay and that is enough even an occasional bevy of friends at the shooting season may be borne if arthur get so firmly attached to me so well established in good sense and principles before they come that i shall be able by reason and affection to keep him pure from their contaminations
vain hope i fear
but still till such a time of trial comes i will forbear to think of my quiet asylum in the beloved old hall
mr and mrs hattersley have been staying at the grove a fortnight and as mr hargrave is still absent and the weather was remarkably fine i never passed a day without seeing my two friends milicent and esther either there or here
on one occasion when mr hattersley had driven them over to grassdale in the phaeton with little helen and ralph and we were all enjoying ourselves in the gardeni had a few minutes conversation with that gentleman while the ladies were amusing themselves with the children
do you want to hear anything of your husband mrs huntingdon said he
no unless you can tell me when to expect him home i cantyou dont want him do you said he with a broad grin
no well i think youre better without him sure enoughfor my part im downright weary of him
i told him id leave him if he didnt mend his manners and he wouldnt so i left him
you see im a better man than you think me and whats more i have serious thoughts of washing my hands of him entirely and the whole set of em and comporting myself from this day forward with all decency and sobriety as a christian and the father of a family should do
what do you think of that it is a resolution you ought to have formed long ago well im not thirty yet it isnt too late is it no it is never too late to reform as long as you have the sense to desire it and the strength to execute your purpose well to tell you the truth ive thought of it often and often before but hes such devilish good company is huntingdon after all
you cant imagine what a jovial good fellow he is when hes not fairly drunk only just primed or halfseasover
we all have a bit of a liking for him at the bottom of our hearts though we cant respect him but should you wish yourself to be like him no id rather be like myself bad as i am you cant continue as bad as you are without getting worse and more brutalised every day and therefore more like him i could not help smiling at the comical halfangry halfconfounded look he put on at this rather unusual mode of address
never mind my plain speaking said i it is from the best of motives
but tell me should you wish your sons to be like mr huntingdonor even like yourself hang it
no should you wish your daughter to despise youor at least to feel no vestige of respect for you and no affection but what is mingled with the bitterest regret oh no
i couldnt stand that and finally should you wish your wife to be ready to sink into the earth when she hears you mentioned and to loathe the very sound of your voice and shudder at your approach she never will she likes me all the same whatever i do impossible mr hattersley
you mistake her quiet submission for affection fire and fury now dont burst into a tempest at that
i dont mean to say she does not love youshe does i know a great deal better than you deserve but i am quite sure that if you behave better she will love you more and if you behave worse she will love you less and less till all is lost in fear aversion and bitterness of soul if not in secret hatred and contempt
but dropping the subject of affection should you wish to be the tyrant of her lifeto take away all the sunshine from her existence and make her thoroughly miserable of course not and i dont and im not going to you have done more towards it than you suppose pooh pooh
shes not the susceptible anxious worriting creature you imagine shes a little meek peaceable affectionate body apt to be rather sulky at times but quiet and cool in the main and ready to take things as they come think of what she was five years ago when you married her and what she is now i know she was a little plump lassie then with a pretty pink and white face now shes a poor little bit of a creature fading and melting away like a snowwreath
but hang itthats not my fault what is the cause of it then
not years for shes only fiveandtwenty its her own delicate health and confound it madam
what would you make of meand the children to be sure that worry her to death between them no mr hattersley the children give her more pleasure than pain they are fine welldispositioned children i know they arebless them then why lay the blame on themill tell you what it is its silent fretting and constant anxiety on your account mingled i suspect with something of bodily fear on her own
when you behave well she can only rejoice with trembling she has no security no confidence in your judgment or principles but is continually dreading the close of such shortlived felicity when you behave ill her causes of terror and misery are more than any one can tell but herself
in patient endurance of evil she forgets it is our duty to admonish our neighbours of their transgressions
since you will mistake her silence for indifference come with me and ill show you one or two of her lettersno breach of confidence i hope since you are her other half he followed me into the library
i sought out and put into his hands two of milicents letters one dated from london and written during one of his wildest seasons of reckless dissipation the other in the country during a lucid interval
the former was full of trouble and anguish not accusing him but deeply regretting his connection with his profligate companions abusing mr grimsby and others insinuating bitter things against mr huntingdon and most ingeniously throwing the blame of her husbands misconduct on to other mens shoulders
the latter was full of hope and joy yet with a trembling consciousness that this happiness would not last praising his goodness to the skies but with an evident though but halfexpressed wish that it were based on a surer foundation than the natural impulses of the heart and a halfprophetic dread of the fall of that house so founded on the sandwhich fall had shortly after taken place as hattersley must have been conscious while he read
almost at the commencement of the first letter i had the unexpected pleasure of seeing him blush but he immediately turned his back to me and finished the perusal at the window
at the second i saw him once or twice raise his hand and hurriedly pass it across his face
could it be to dash away a tear
when he had done there was an interval spent in clearing his throat and staring out of the window and then after whistling a few bars of a favourite air he turned round gave me back the letters and silently shook me by the hand
ive been a cursed rascal god knows said he as he gave it a hearty squeeze but you see if i dont make amends for itdn me if i dont dont curse yourself mr hattersley if god had heard half your invocations of that kind you would have been in hell long before nowand you cannot make amends for the past by doing your duty for the future inasmuch as your duty is only what you owe to your maker and you cannot do more than fulfil it another must make amends for your past delinquencies
if you intend to reform invoke gods blessing his mercy and his aid not his curse god help me thenfor im sure i need it
wheres milicent shes there just coming in with her sister he stepped out at the glass door and went to meet them
i followed at a little distance
somewhat to his wifes astonishment he lifted her off from the ground and saluted her with a hearty kiss and a strong embrace then placing his two hands on her shoulders he gave her i suppose a sketch of the great things he meant to do for she suddenly threw her arms round him and burst into tears exclaimingdo do ralphwe shall be so happy
how very very good you are nay not i said he turning her round and pushing her towards me
thank her its her doing milicent flew to thank me overflowing with gratitude
i disclaimed all title to it telling her her husband was predisposed to amendment before i added my mite of exhortation and encouragement and that i had only done what she might and ought to have done herself
oh no cried she i couldnt have influenced him im sure by anything that i could have said
i should only have bothered him by my clumsy efforts at persuasion if i had made the attempt you never tried me milly said he
shortly after they took their leave
they are now gone on a visit to hattersleys father
after that they will repair to their country home
i hope his good resolutions will not fall through and poor milicent will not be again disappointed
her last letter was full of present bliss and pleasing anticipations for the future but no particular temptation has yet occurred to put his virtue to the test
henceforth however she will doubtless be somewhat less timid and reserved and he more kind and thoughtfulsurely then her hopes are not unfounded and i have one bright spot at least whereon to rest my thoughts
october thmr
huntingdon returned about three weeks ago
his appearance his demeanour and conversation and my feelings with regard to him i shall not trouble myself to describe
the day after his arrival however he surprised me by the announcement of an intention to procure a governess for little arthur i told him it was quite unnecessary not to say ridiculous at the present season i thought i was fully competent to the task of teaching him myselffor some years to come at least the childs education was the only pleasure and business of my life and since he had deprived me of every other occupation he might surely leave me that
he said i was not fit to teach children or to be with them i had already reduced the boy to little better than an automaton i had broken his fine spirit with my rigid severity and i should freeze all the sunshine out of his heart and make him as gloomy an ascetic as myself if i had the handling of him much longer
and poor rachel too came in for her share of abuse as usual he cannot endure rachel because he knows she has a proper appreciation of him
i calmly defended our several qualifications as nurse and governess and still resisted the proposed addition to our family but he cut me short by saying it was no use bothering about the matter for he had engaged a governess already and she was coming next week so that all i had to do was to get things ready for her reception
this was a rather startling piece of intelligence
i ventured to inquire her name and address by whom she had been recommended or how he had been led to make choice of her
she is a very estimable pious young person said he you neednt be afraid
her name is myers i believe and she was recommended to me by a respectable old dowager a lady of high repute in the religious world
i have not seen her myself and therefore cannot give you a particular account of her person and conversation and so forth but if the old ladys eulogies are correct you will find her to possess all desirable qualifications for her position an inordinate love of children among the rest all this was gravely and quietly spoken but there was a laughing demon in his halfaverted eye that boded no good i imagined
however i thought of my asylum in shire and made no further objections
when miss myers arrived i was not prepared to give her a very cordial reception
her appearance was not particularly calculated to produce a favourable impression at first sight nor did her manners and subsequent conduct in any degree remove the prejudice i had already conceived against her
her attainments were limited her intellect noways above mediocrity
she had a fine voice and could sing like a nightingale and accompany herself sufficiently well on the piano but these were her only accomplishments
there was a look of guile and subtlety in her face a sound of it in her voice
she seemed afraid of me and would start if i suddenly approached her
in her behaviour she was respectful and complaisant even to servility she attempted to flatter and fawn upon me at first but i soon checked that
her fondness for her little pupil was overstrained and i was obliged to remonstrate with her on the subject of overindulgence and injudicious praise but she could not gain his heart
her piety consisted in an occasional heaving of sighs and uplifting of eyes to the ceiling and the utterance of a few cant phrases
she told me she was a clergymans daughter and had been left an orphan from her childhood but had had the good fortune to obtain a situation in a very pious family and then she spoke so gratefully of the kindness she had experienced from its different members that i reproached myself for my uncharitable thoughts and unfriendly conduct and relented for a time but not for long my causes of dislike were too rational my suspicions too well founded for that and i knew it was my duty to watch and scrutinize till those suspicions were either satisfactorily removed or confirmed
i asked the name and residence of the kind and pious family
she mentioned a common name and an unknown and distant place of abode but told me they were now on the continent and their present address was unknown to her
i never saw her speak much to mr huntingdon but he would frequently look into the schoolroom to see how little arthur got on with his new companion when i was not there
in the evening she sat with us in the drawingroom and would sing and play to amuse him or us as she pretended and was very attentive to his wants and watchful to anticipate them though she only talked to me indeed he was seldom in a condition to be talked to
had she been other than she was i should have felt her presence a great relief to come between us thus except indeed that i should have been thoroughly ashamed for any decent person to see him as he often was
i did not mention my suspicions to rachel but she having sojourned for half a century in this land of sin and sorrow has learned to be suspicious herself
she told me from the first she was down of that new governess and i soon found she watched her quite as narrowly as i did and i was glad of it for i longed to know the truth the atmosphere of grassdale seemed to stifle me and i could only live by thinking of wildfell hall
at last one morning she entered my chamber with such intelligence that my resolution was taken before she had ceased to speak
while she dressed me i explained to her my intentions and what assistance i should require from her and told her which of my things she was to pack up and what she was to leave behind for herself as i had no other means of recompensing her for this sudden dismissal after her long and faithful service a circumstance i most deeply regretted but could not avoid
and what will you do rachel said i will you go home or seek another place i have no home maam but with you she replied and if i leave you ill never go into place again as long as i live but i cant afford to live like a lady now returned i i must be my own maid and my childs nurse what signifies replied she in some excitement
youll want somebody to clean and wash and cook wont you
i can do all that and never mind the wages ive my bits o savings yet and if you wouldnt take me i should have to find my own board and lodging out of em somewhere or else work among strangers and its what im not used to so you can please yourself maam her voice quavered as she spoke and the tears stood in her eyes
i should like it above all things rachel and id give you such wages as i could afford such as i should give to any servantofallwork i might employ but dont you see i should be dragging you down with me when you have done nothing to deserve it oh fiddle ejaculated she
and besides my future way of living will be so widely different to the past so different to all you have been accustomed to do you think maam i cant bear what my missis can
surely im not so proud and so dainty as that comes to and my little master too god bless him but im young rachel i shant mind it and arthur is young too it will be nothing to him nor me either im not so old but what i can stand hard fare and hard work if its only to help and comfort them as ive loved like my own bairns for all im too old to bide the thoughts o leaving em in trouble and danger and going amongst strangers myself then you shant rachel cried i embracing my faithful friend
well all go together and you shall see how the new life suits you bless you honey cried she affectionately returning my embrace
only let us get shut of this wicked house and well do right enough youll see so think i was my answer and so that point was settled
by that mornings post i despatched a few hasty lines to frederick beseeching him to prepare my asylum for my immediate reception for i should probably come to claim it within a day after the receipt of that note and telling him in few words the cause of my sudden resolution
i then wrote three letters of adieu the first to esther hargrave in which i told her that i found it impossible to stay any longer at grassdale or to leave my son under his fathers protection and as it was of the last importance that our future abode should be unknown to him and his acquaintance i should disclose it to no one but my brother through the medium of whom i hoped still to correspond with my friends
i then gave her his address exhorted her to write frequently reiterated some of my former admonitions regarding her own concerns and bade her a fond farewell
the second was to milicent much to the same effect but a little more confidential as befitted our longer intimacy and her greater experience and better acquaintance with my circumstances
the third was to my aunt a much more difficult and painful undertaking and therefore i had left it to the last but i must give her some explanation of that extraordinary step i had taken and that quickly for she and my uncle would no doubt hear of it within a day or two after my disappearance as it was probable that mr huntingdon would speedily apply to them to know what was become of me
at last however i told her i was sensible of my error i did not complain of its punishment and i was sorry to trouble my friends with its consequences but in duty to my son i must submit no longer it was absolutely necessary that he should be delivered from his fathers corrupting influence
i should not disclose my place of refuge even to her in order that she and my uncle might be able with truth to deny all knowledge concerning it but any communications addressed to me under cover to my brother would be certain to reach me
i hoped she and my uncle would pardon the step i had taken for if they knew all i was sure they would not blame me and i trusted they would not afflict themselves on my account for if i could only reach my retreat in safety and keep it unmolested i should be very happy but for the thoughts of them and should be quite contented to spend my life in obscurity devoting myself to the training up of my child and teaching him to avoid the errors of both his parents
these things were done yesterday i have given two whole days to the preparation for our departure that frederick may have more time to prepare the rooms and rachel to pack up the things for the latter task must be done with the utmost caution and secrecy and there is no one but me to assist her
i can help to get the articles together but i do not understand the art of stowing them into the boxes so as to take up the smallest possible space and there are her own things to do as well as mine and arthurs
i can ill afford to leave anything behind since i have no money except a few guineas in my purse and besides as rachel observed whatever i left would most likely become the property of miss myers and i should not relish that
but what trouble i have had throughout these two days struggling to appear calm and collected to meet him and her as usual when i was obliged to meet them and forcing myself to leave my little arthur in her hands for hours together
but i trust these trials are over now i have laid him in my bed for better security and never more i trust shall his innocent lips be defiled by their contaminating kisses or his young ears polluted by their words
but shall we escape in safety
oh that the morning were come and we were on our way at least
this evening when i had given rachel all the assistance i could and had nothing left me but to wait and wish and tremble i became so greatly agitated that i knew not what to do
i went down to dinner but i could not force myself to eat
mr huntingdon remarked the circumstance
whats to do with you now said he when the removal of the second course gave him time to look about him
i am not well i replied i think i must lie down a little you wont miss me much not the least if you leave your chair itll do just as wellbetter a trifle he muttered as i left the room for i can fancy somebody else fills it somebody else may fill it tomorrow i thought but did not say
there
ive seen the last of you i hope i muttered as i closed the door upon him
rachel urged me to seek repose at once to recruit my strength for tomorrows journey as we must be gone before the dawn but in my present state of nervous excitement that was entirely out of the question
it was equally out of the question to sit or wander about my room counting the hours and the minutes between me and the appointed time of action straining my ears and trembling at every sound lest someone should discover and betray us after all
i took up a book and tried to read my eyes wandered over the pages but it was impossible to bind my thoughts to their contents
why not have recourse to the old expedient and add this last event to my chronicle
i opened its pages once more and wrote the above accountwith difficulty at first but gradually my mind became more calm and steady
thus several hours have passed away the time is drawing near and now my eyes feel heavy and my frame exhausted
i will commend my cause to god and then lie down and gain an hour or two of sleep and then little arthur sleeps soundly
all the house is still there can be no one watching
the boxes were all corded by benson and quietly conveyed down the back stairs after dusk and sent away in a cart to the m coachoffice
the name upon the cards was mrs graham which appellation i mean henceforth to adopt
my mothers maiden name was graham and therefore i fancy i have some claim to it and prefer it to any other except my own which i dare not resume
october ththank heaven i am free and safe at last
early we rose swiftly and quietly dressed slowly and stealthily descended to the hall where benson stood ready with a light to open the door and fasten it after us
we were obliged to let one man into our secret on account of the boxes c all the servants were but too well acquainted with their masters conduct and either benson or john would have been willing to serve me but as the former was more staid and elderly and a crony of rachels besides i of course directed her to make choice of him as her assistant and confidant on the occasion as far as necessity demanded i only hope he may not be brought into trouble thereby and only wish i could reward him for the perilous service he was so ready to undertake
i slipped two guineas into his hand by way of remembrance as he stood in the doorway holding the candle to light our departure with a tear in his honest grey eye and a host of good wishes depicted on his solemn countenance
alas
i could offer no more i had barely sufficient remaining for the probable expenses of the journey
what trembling joy it was when the little wicket closed behind us as we issued from the park
then for one moment i paused to inhale one draught of that cool bracing air and venture one look back upon the house
all was dark and still no light glimmered in the windows no wreath of smoke obscured the stars that sparkled above it in the frosty sky
as i bade farewell for ever to that place the scene of so much guilt and misery i felt glad that i had not left it before for now there was no doubt about the propriety of such a stepno shadow of remorse for him i left behind
there was nothing to disturb my joy but the fear of detection and every step removed us further from the chance of that
we had left grassdale many miles behind us before the round red sun arose to welcome our deliverance and if any inhabitant of its vicinity had chanced to see us then as we bowled along on the top of the coach i scarcely think they would have suspected our identity
as i intend to be taken for a widow i thought it advisable to enter my new abode in mourning i was therefore attired in a plain black silk dress and mantle a black veil which i kept carefully over my face for the first twenty or thirty miles of the journey and a black silk bonnet which i had been constrained to borrow of rachel for want of such an article myself
it was not in the newest fashion of course but none the worse for that under present circumstances
arthur was clad in his plainest clothes and wrapped in a coarse woollen shawl and rachel was muffled in a grey cloak and hood that had seen better days and gave her more the appearance of an ordinary though decent old woman than of a ladysmaid
oh what delight it was to be thus seated aloft rumbling along the broad sunshiny road with the fresh morning breeze in my face surrounded by an unknown country all smilingcheerfully gloriously smiling in the yellow lustre of those early beams with my darling child in my arms almost as happy as myself and my faithful friend beside me a prison and despair behind me receding further further back at every clatter of the horses feet and liberty and hope before
i could hardly refrain from praising god aloud for my deliverance or astonishing my fellowpassengers by some surprising outburst of hilarity
but the journey was a very long one and we were all weary enough before the close of it
it was far into the night when we reached the town of l and still we were seven miles from our journeys end and there was no more coaching nor any conveyance to be had except a common cart and that with the greatest difficulty for half the town was in bed
and a dreary ride we had of it that last stage of the journey cold and weary as we were sitting on our boxes with nothing to cling to nothing to lean against slowly dragged and cruelly shaken over the rough hilly roads
but arthur was asleep in rachels lap and between us we managed pretty well to shield him from the cold night air
at last we began to ascend a terribly steep and stony lane which in spite of the darkness rachel said she remembered well she had often walked there with me in her arms and little thought to come again so many years after under such circumstances as the present
arthur being now awakened by the jolting and the stoppages we all got out and walked
we had not far to go but what if frederick should not have received my letter
or if he should not have had time to prepare the rooms for our reception and we should find them all dark damp and comfortless destitute of food fire and furniture after all our toil
at length the grim dark pile appeared before us
the lane conducted us round by the back way
we entered the desolate court and in breathless anxiety surveyed the ruinous mass
was it all blackness and desolation
no one faint red glimmer cheered us from a window where the lattice was in good repair
the door was fastened but after due knocking and waiting and some parleying with a voice from an upper window we were admitted by an old woman who had been commissioned to air and keep the house till our arrival into a tolerably snug little apartment formerly the scullery of the mansion which frederick had now fitted up as a kitchen
here she procured us a light roused the fire to a cheerful blaze and soon prepared a simple repast for our refreshment while we disencumbered ourselves of our travellinggear and took a hasty survey of our new abode
besides the kitchen there were two bedrooms a goodsized parlour and another smaller one which i destined for my studio all well aired and seemingly in good repair but only partly furnished with a few old articles chiefly of ponderous black oak the veritable ones that had been there before and which had been kept as antiquarian relics in my brothers present residence and now in all haste transported back again
the old woman brought my supper and arthurs into the parlour and told me with all due formality that the master desired his compliments to mrs graham and he had prepared the rooms as well as he could upon so short a notice but he would do himself the pleasure of calling upon her tomorrow to receive her further commands i was glad to ascend the sternlooking stone staircase and lie down in the gloomy oldfashioned bed beside my little arthur
he was asleep in a minute but weary as i was my excited feelings and restless cogitations kept me awake till dawn began to struggle with the darkness but sleep was sweet and refreshing when it came and the waking was delightful beyond expression
it was little arthur that roused me with his gentle kisses
he was here then safely clasped in my arms and many leagues away from his unworthy father
broad daylight illumined the apartment for the sun was high in heaven though obscured by rolling masses of autumnal vapour
the scene indeed was not remarkably cheerful in itself either within or without
the large bare room with its grim old furniture the narrow latticed windows revealing the dull grey sky above and the desolate wilderness below where the dark stone walls and iron gate the rank growth of grass and weeds and the hardy evergreens of preternatural forms alone remained to tell that there had been once a gardenand the bleak and barren fields beyond might have struck me as gloomy enough at another time but now each separate object seemed to echo back my own exhilarating sense of hope and freedom indefinite dreams of the far past and bright anticipations of the future seemed to greet me at every turn
i should rejoice with more security to be sure had the broad sea rolled between my present and my former homes but surely in this lonely spot i might remain unknown and then i had my brother here to cheer my solitude with his occasional visits
he came that morning and i have had several interviews with him since but he is obliged to be very cautious when and how he comes not even his servants or his best friends must know of his visits to wildfellexcept on such occasions as a landlord might be expected to call upon a stranger tenantlest suspicion should be excited against me whether of the truth or of some slanderous falsehood
i have now been here nearly a fortnight and but for one disturbing care the haunting dread of discovery i am comfortably settled in my new home frederick has supplied me with all requisite furniture and painting materials rachel has sold most of my clothes for me in a distant town and procured me a wardrobe more suitable to my present position i have a secondhand piano and a tolerably wellstocked bookcase in my parlour and my other room has assumed quite a professional businesslike appearance already
i am working hard to repay my brother for all his expenses on my account not that there is the slightest necessity for anything of the kind but it pleases me to do so i shall have so much more pleasure in my labour my earnings my frugal fare and household economy when i know that i am paying my way honestly and that what little i possess is legitimately all my own and that no one suffers for my follyin a pecuniary way at least
i shall make him take the last penny i owe him if i can possibly effect it without offending him too deeply
i have a few pictures already done for i told rachel to pack up all i had and she executed her commission but too wellfor among the rest she put up a portrait of mr huntingdon that i had painted in the first year of my marriage
it struck me with dismay at the moment when i took it from the box and beheld those eyes fixed upon me in their mocking mirth as if exulting still in his power to control my fate and deriding my efforts to escape
how widely different had been my feelings in painting that portrait to what they now were in looking upon it
how i had studied and toiled to produce something as i thought worthy of the original
what mingled pleasure and dissatisfaction i had had in the result of my labourspleasure for the likeness i had caught dissatisfaction because i had not made it handsome enough
now i see no beauty in itnothing pleasing in any part of its expression and yet it is far handsomer and far more agreeablefar less repulsive i should rather saythan he is now for these six years have wrought almost as great a change upon himself as on my feelings regarding him
the frame however is handsome enough it will serve for another painting
the picture itself i have not destroyed as i had first intended i have put it aside not i think from any lurking tenderness for the memory of past affection nor yet to remind me of my former folly but chiefly that i may compare my sons features and countenance with this as he grows up and thus be enabled to judge how much or how little he resembles his fatherif i may be allowed to keep him with me still and never to behold that fathers face againa blessing i hardly dare reckon upon
it seems mr huntingdon is making every exertion to discover the place of my retreat
he has been in person to staningley seeking redress for his grievancesexpecting to hear of his victims if not to find them thereand has told so many lies and with such unblushing coolness that my uncle more than half believes him and strongly advocates my going back to him and being friends again
but my aunt knows better she is too cool and cautious and too well acquainted with both my husbands character and my own to be imposed upon by any specious falsehoods the former could invent
but he does not want me back he wants my child and gives my friends to understand that if i prefer living apart from him he will indulge the whim and let me do so unmolested and even settle a reasonable allowance on me provided i will immediately deliver up his son
but heaven help me
i am not going to sell my child for gold though it were to save both him and me from starving it would be better that he should die with me than that he should live with his father
frederick showed me a letter he had received from that gentleman full of cool impudence such as would astonish any one who did not know him but such as i am convinced none would know better how to answer than my brother
he gave me no account of his reply except to tell me that he had not acknowledged his acquaintance with my place of refuge but rather left it to be inferred that it was quite unknown to him by saying it was useless to apply to him or any other of my relations for information on the subject as it appeared i had been driven to such extremity that i had concealed my retreat even from my best friends but that if he had known it or should at any time be made aware of it most certainly mr huntingdon would be the last person to whom he should communicate the intelligence and that he need not trouble himself to bargain for the child for he frederick fancied he knew enough of his sister to enable him to declare that wherever she might be or however situated no consideration would induce her to deliver him up
thalas
my kind neighbours will not let me alone
by some means they have ferreted me out and i have had to sustain visits from three different families all more or less bent upon discovering who and what i am whence i came and why i have chosen such a home as this
their society is unnecessary to me to say the least and their curiosity annoys and alarms me if i gratify it it may lead to the ruin of my son and if i am too mysterious it will only excite their suspicions invite conjecture and rouse them to greater exertionsand perhaps be the means of spreading my fame from parish to parish till it reach the ears of some one who will carry it to the lord of grassdale manor
i shall be expected to return their calls but if upon inquiry i find that any of them live too far away for arthur to accompany me they must expect in vain for a while for i cannot bear to leave him unless it be to go to church and i have not attempted that yet forit may be foolish weakness but i am under such constant dread of his being snatched away that i am never easy when he is not by my side and i fear these nervous terrors would so entirely disturb my devotions that i should obtain no benefit from the attendance
i mean however to make the experiment next sunday and oblige myself to leave him in charge of rachel for a few hours
it will be a hard task but surely no imprudence and the vicar has been to scold me for my neglect of the ordinances of religion
i had no sufficient excuse to offer and i promised if all were well he should see me in my pew next sunday for i do not wish to be set down as an infidel and besides i know i should derive great comfort and benefit from an occasional attendance at public worship if i could only have faith and fortitude to compose my thoughts in conformity with the solemn occasion and forbid them to be for ever dwelling on my absent child and on the dreadful possibility of finding him gone when i return and surely god in his mercy will preserve me from so severe a trial for my childs own sake if not for mine he will not suffer him to be torn away
november rdi have made some further acquaintance with my neighbours
the fine gentleman and beau of the parish and its vicinity in his own estimation at least is a young here it ended
the rest was torn away
how cruel just when she was going to mention me
for i could not doubt it was your humble servant she was about to mention though not very favourably of course
i could tell that as well by those few words as by the recollection of her whole aspect and demeanour towards me in the commencement of our acquaintance
well
i could readily forgive her prejudice against me and her hard thoughts of our sex in general when i saw to what brilliant specimens her experience had been limited
respecting me however she had long since seen her error and perhaps fallen into another in the opposite extreme for if at first her opinion of me had been lower than i deserved i was convinced that now my deserts were lower than her opinion and if the former part of this continuation had been torn away to avoid wounding my feelings perhaps the latter portion had been removed for fear of ministering too much to my selfconceit
at any rate i would have given much to have seen it allto have witnessed the gradual change and watched the progress of her esteem and friendship for me and whatever warmer feeling she might have to have seen how much of love there was in her regard and how it had grown upon her in spite of her virtuous resolutions and strenuous exertions tobut no i had no right to see it all this was too sacred for any eyes but her own and she had done well to keep it from me
well halford what do you think of all this
and while you read it did you ever picture to yourself what my feelings would probably be during its perusal
most likely not but i am not going to descant upon them now i will only make this acknowledgment little honourable as it may be to human nature and especially to myselfthat the former half of the narrative was to me more painful than the latter not that i was at all insensible to mrs huntingdons wrongs or unmoved by her sufferings but i must confess i felt a kind of selfish gratification in watching her husbands gradual decline in her good graces and seeing how completely he extinguished all her affection at last
the effect of the whole however in spite of all my sympathy for her and my fury against him was to relieve my mind of an intolerable burden and fill my heart with joy as if some friend had roused me from a dreadful nightmare
it was now near eight oclock in the morning for my candle had expired in the midst of my perusal leaving me no alternative but to get another at the expense of alarming the house or to go to bed and wait the return of daylight
on my mothers account i chose the latter but how willingly i sought my pillow and how much sleep it brought me i leave you to imagine
at the first appearance of dawn i rose and brought the manuscript to the window but it was impossible to read it yet
i devoted half an hour to dressing and then returned to it again
now with a little difficulty i could manage and with intense and eager interest i devoured the remainder of its contents
when it was ended and my transient regret at its abrupt conclusion was over i opened the window and put out my head to catch the cooling breeze and imbibe deep draughts of the pure morning air
a splendid morning it was the halffrozen dew lay thick on the grass the swallows were twittering round me the rooks cawing and cows lowing in the distance and early frost and summer sunshine mingled their sweetness in the air
but i did not think of that a confusion of countless thoughts and varied emotions crowded upon me while i gazed abstractedly on the lovely face of nature
soon however this chaos of thoughts and passions cleared away giving place to two distinct emotions joy unspeakable that my adored helen was all i wished to think herthat through the noisome vapours of the worlds aspersions and my own fancied convictions her character shone bright and clear and stainless as that sun i could not bear to look on and shame and deep remorse for my own conduct
immediately after breakfast i hurried over to wildfell hall
rachel had risen many degrees in my estimation since yesterday
i was ready to greet her quite as an old friend but every kindly impulse was checked by the look of cold distrust she cast upon me on opening the door
the old virgin had constituted herself the guardian of her ladys honour i suppose and doubtless she saw in me another mr hargrave only the more dangerous in being more esteemed and trusted by her mistress
missis cant see any one today sirshes poorly said she in answer to my inquiry for mrs graham
but i must see her rachel said i placing my hand on the door to prevent its being shut against me
indeed sir you cant replied she settling her countenance in still more iron frigidity than before
be so good as to announce me its no manner of use mr markham shes poorly i tell you just in time to prevent me from committing the impropriety of taking the citadel by storm and pushing forward unannounced an inner door opened and little arthur appeared with his frolicsome playfellow the dog
he seized my hand between both his and smilingly drew me forward
mamma says youre to come in mr markham said he and i am to go out and play with rover rachel retired with a sigh and i stepped into the parlour and shut the door
there before the fireplace stood the tall graceful figure wasted with many sorrows
i cast the manuscript on the table and looked in her face
anxious and pale it was turned towards me her clear dark eyes were fixed on mine with a gaze so intensely earnest that they bound me like a spell
have you looked it over she murmured
the spell was broken
ive read it through said i advancing into the roomand i want to know if youll forgive meif you can forgive me she did not answer but her eyes glistened and a faint red mantled on her lip and cheek
as i approached she abruptly turned away and went to the window
it was not in anger i was well assured but only to conceal or control her emotion
i therefore ventured to follow and stand beside her therebut not to speak
she gave me her hand without turning her head and murmured in a voice she strove in vain to steady can you forgive me it might be deemed a breach of trust i thought to convey that lily hand to my lips so i only gently pressed it between my own and smilingly repliedi hardly can
you should have told me this before
it shows a want of confidence oh no cried she eagerly interrupting me it was not that
it was no want of confidence in you but if i had told you anything of my history i must have told you all in order to excuse my conduct and i might well shrink from such a disclosure till necessity obliged me to make it
but you forgive mei have done very very wrong i know but as usual i have reaped the bitter fruits of my own errorand must reap them to the end bitter indeed was the tone of anguish repressed by resolute firmness in which this was spoken
now i raised her hand to my lips and fervently kissed it again and again for tears prevented any other reply
she suffered these wild caresses without resistance or resentment then suddenly turning from me she paced twice or thrice through the room
i knew by the contraction of her brow the tight compression of her lips and wringing of her hands that meantime a violent conflict between reason and passion was silently passing within
at length she paused before the empty fireplace and turning to me said calmlyif that might be called calmness which was so evidently the result of a violent effort now gilbert you must leave menot this moment but soonand you must never come again never again helen
just when i love you more than ever for that very reason if it be so we should not meet again
i thought this interview was necessaryat least i persuaded myself it was sothat we might severally ask and receive each others pardon for the past but there can be no excuse for another
i shall leave this place as soon as i have means to seek another asylum but our intercourse must end here end here echoed i and approaching the high carved chimneypiece i leant my hand against its heavy mouldings and dropped my forehead upon it in silent sullen despondency
you must not come again continued she
there was a slight tremor in her voice but i thought her whole manner was provokingly composed considering the dreadful sentence she pronounced
you must know why i tell you so she resumed and you must see that it is better to part at onceif it be hard to say adieu for ever you ought to help me she paused
i did not answer
will you promise not to comeif you wont and if you do come here again you will drive me away before i know where to find another place of refugeor how to seek it helen said i turning impatiently towards her i cannot discuss the matter of eternal separation calmly and dispassionately as you can do
it is no question of mere expedience with me it is a question of life and death she was silent
her pale lips quivered and her fingers trembled with agitation as she nervously entwined them in the hairchain to which was appended her small gold watchthe only thing of value she had permitted herself to keep
i had said an unjust and cruel thing but i must needs follow it up with something worse
but helen i began in a soft low tone not daring to raise my eyes to her face that man is not your husband in the sight of heaven he has forfeited all claim to she seized my arm with a grasp of startling energy
gilbert dont she cried in a tone that would have pierced a heart of adamant
for gods sake dont you attempt these arguments
no fiend could torture me like this i wont i wont said i gently laying my hand on hers almost as much alarmed at her vehemence as ashamed of my own misconduct
instead of acting like a true friend continued she breaking from me and throwing herself into the old armchair and helping me with all your mightor rather taking your own part in the struggle of right against passionyou leave all the burden to meand not satisfied with that you do your utmost to fight against mewhen you know that she paused and hid her face in her handkerchief
forgive me helen pleaded i
i will never utter another word on the subject
but may we not still meet as friends it will not do she replied mournfully shaking her head and then she raised her eyes to mine with a mildly reproachful look that seemed to say you must know that as well as i then what must we do cried i passionately
but immediately i added in a quieter toneill do whatever you desire only dont say that this meeting is to be our last and why not
dont you know that every time we meet the thoughts of the final parting will become more painful
dont you feel that every interview makes us dearer to each other than the last the utterance of this last question was hurried and low and the downcast eyes and burning blush too plainly showed that she at least had felt it
it was scarcely prudent to make such an admission or to addas she presently didi have power to bid you go now another time it might be differentbut i was not base enough to attempt to take advantage of her candour
but we may write i timidly suggested
you will not deny me that consolation we can hear of each other through my brother your brother a pang of remorse and shame shot through me
she had not heard of the injury he had sustained at my hands and i had not the courage to tell her
your brother will not help us i said he would have all communion between us to be entirely at an end and he would be right i suppose
as a friend of both he would wish us both well and every friend would tell us it was our interest as well as our duty to forget each other though we might not see it ourselves
but dont be afraid gilbert she added smiling sadly at my manifest discomposure there is little chance of my forgetting you
but i did not mean that frederick should be the means of transmitting messages between usonly that each might know through him of the others welfareand more than this ought not to be for you are young gilbert and you ought to marryand will some time though you may think it impossible now and though i hardly can say i wish you to forget me i know it is right that you should both for your own happiness and that of your future wifeand therefore i must and will wish it she added resolutely
and you are young too helen i boldly replied and when that profligate scoundrel has run through his career you will give your hand to meill wait till then but she would not leave me this support
independently of the moral evil of basing our hopes upon the death of another who if unfit for this world was at least no less so for the next and whose amelioration would thus become our bane and his greatest transgression our greatest benefitshe maintained it to be madness many men of mr huntingdons habits had lived to a ripe though miserable old age
and if i said she am young in years i am old in sorrow but even if trouble should fail to kill me before vice destroys him think if he reached but fifty years or so would you wait twenty or fifteenin vague uncertainty and suspensethrough all the prime of youth and manhoodand marry at last a woman faded and worn as i shall bewithout ever having seen me from this day to thatyou would not she continued interrupting my earnest protestations of unfailing constancyor if you would you should not
trust me gilbert in this matter i know better than you
you think me cold and stonyhearted and you may but i dont helen well never mind you might if you would but i have not spent my solitude in utter idleness and i am not speaking now from the impulse of the moment as you do
i have thought of all these matters again and again i have argued these questions with myself and pondered well our past and present and future career and believe me i have come to the right conclusion at last
trust my words rather than your own feelings now and in a few years you will see that i was rightthough at present i hardly can see it myself she murmured with a sigh as she rested her head on her hand
and dont argue against me any more all you can say has been already said by my own heart and refuted by my reason
it was hard enough to combat those suggestions as they were whispered within me in your mouth they are ten times worse and if you knew how much they pain me you would cease at once i know
if you knew my present feelings you would even try to relieve them at the expense of your own i will goin a minute if that can relieve youand never return said i with bitter emphasis
but if we may never meet and never hope to meet again is it a crime to exchange our thoughts by letter
may not kindred spirits meet and mingle in communion whatever be the fate and circumstances of their earthly tenements they may they may cried she with a momentary burst of glad enthusiasm
i thought of that too gilbert but i feared to mention it because i feared you would not understand my views upon the subject
i fear it even nowi fear any kind friend would tell us we are both deluding ourselves with the idea of keeping up a spiritual intercourse without hope or prospect of anything furtherwithout fostering vain regrets and hurtful aspirations and feeding thoughts that should be sternly and pitilessly left to perish of inanition never mind our kind friends if they can part our bodies it is enough in gods name let them not sunder our souls cried i in terror lest she should deem it her duty to deny us this last remaining consolation
but no letters can pass between us here said she without giving fresh food for scandal and when i departed i had intended that my new abode should be unknown to you as to the rest of the world not that i should doubt your word if you promised not to visit me but i thought you would be more tranquil in your own mind if you knew you could not do it and likely to find less difficulty in abstracting yourself from me if you could not picture my situation to your mind
but listen said she smilingly putting up her finger to check my impatient reply in six months you shall hear from frederick precisely where i am and if you still retain your wish to write to me and think you can maintain a correspondence all thought all spiritsuch as disembodied souls or unimpassioned friends at least might holdwrite and i will answer you six months yes to give your present ardour time to cool and try the truth and constancy of your souls love for mine
and now enough has been said between us
why cant we part at once exclaimed she almost wildly after a moments pause as she suddenly rose from her chair with her hands resolutely clasped together
i thought it was my duty to go without delay and i approached and half extended my hand as if to take leaveshe grasped it in silence
but this thought of final separation was too intolerable it seemed to squeeze the blood out of my heart and my feet were glued to the floor
and must we never meet again i murmured in the anguish of my soul
we shall meet in heaven
let us think of that said she in a tone of desperate calmness but her eyes glittered wildly and her face was deadly pale
but not as we are now i could not help replying
it gives me little consolation to think i shall next behold you as a disembodied spirit or an altered being with a frame perfect and glorious but not like thisand a heart perhaps entirely estranged from me no gilbert there is perfect love in heaven so perfect i suppose that it soars above distinctions and you will have no closer sympathy with me than with any one of the ten thousand thousand angels and the innumerable multitude of happy spirits round us whatever i am you will be the same and therefore cannot possibly regret it and whatever that change may be we know it must be for the better but if i am to be so changed that i shall cease to adore you with my whole heart and soul and love you beyond every other creature i shall not be myself and though if ever i win heaven at all i must i know be infinitely better and happier than i am now my earthly nature cannot rejoice in the anticipation of such beatitude from which itself and its chief joy must be excluded is your love all earthly then no but i am supposing we shall have no more intimate communion with each other than with the rest if so it will be because we love them more and not each other less
increase of love brings increase of happiness when it is mutual and pure as that will be but can you helen contemplate with delight this prospect of losing me in a sea of glory i own i cannot but we know not that it will be soand i do know that to regret the exchange of earthly pleasures for the joys of heaven is as if the grovelling caterpillar should lament that it must one day quit the nibbled leaf to soar aloft and flutter through the air roving at will from flower to flower sipping sweet honey from their cups or basking in their sunny petals
if these little creatures knew how great a change awaited them no doubt they would regret it but would not all such sorrow be misplaced
and if that illustration will not move you here is anotherwe are children now we feel as children and we understand as children and when we are told that men and women do not play with toys and that our companions will one day weary of the trivial sports and occupations that interest them and us so deeply now we cannot help being saddened at the thoughts of such an alteration because we cannot conceive that as we grow up our own minds will become so enlarged and elevated that we ourselves shall then regard as trifling those objects and pursuits we now so fondly cherish and that though our companions will no longer join us in those childish pastimes they will drink with us at other fountains of delight and mingle their souls with ours in higher aims and nobler occupations beyond our present comprehension but not less deeply relished or less truly good for that while yet both we and they remain essentially the same individuals as before
but gilbert can you really derive no consolation from the thought that we may meet together where there is no more pain and sorrow no more striving against sin and struggling of the spirit against the flesh where both will behold the same glorious truths and drink exalted and supreme felicity from the same fountain of light and goodnessthat being whom both will worship with the same intensity of holy ardourand where pure and happy creatures both will love with the same divine affection
if you cannot never write to me helen i can
if faith would never fail now then exclaimed she while this hope is strong within us we will part i cried
you shall not have the pain of another effort to dismiss me
i will go at once but i did not put my request in words she understood it instinctively and this time she yielded tooor rather there was nothing so deliberate as requesting or yielding in the matter there was a sudden impulse that neither could resist
one moment i stood and looked into her face the next i held her to my heart and we seemed to grow together in a close embrace from which no physical or mental force could rend us
a whispered god bless you and gogo was all she said but while she spoke she held me so fast that without violence i could not have obeyed her
at length however by some heroic effort we tore ourselves apart and i rushed from the house
i have a confused remembrance of seeing little arthur running up the gardenwalk to meet me and of bolting over the wall to avoid himand subsequently running down the steep fields clearing the stone fences and hedges as they came in my way till i got completely out of sight of the old hall and down to the bottom of the hill and then of long hours spent in bitter tears and lamentations and melancholy musings in the lonely valley with the eternal music in my ears of the west wind rushing through the overshadowing trees and the brook babbling and gurgling along its stony bed my eyes for the most part vacantly fixed on the deep chequered shades restlessly playing over the bright sunny grass at my feet where now and then a withered leaf or two would come dancing to share the revelry but my heart was away up the hill in that dark room where she was weeping desolate and aloneshe whom i was not to comfort not to see again till years or suffering had overcome us both and torn our spirits from their perishing abodes of clay
there was little business done that day you may be sure
the farm was abandoned to the labourers and the labourers were left to their own devices
but one duty must be attended to i had not forgotten my assault upon frederick lawrence and i must see him to apologise for the unhappy deed
i would fain have put it off till the morrow but what if he should denounce me to his sister in the meantime
no no
i must ask his pardon today and entreat him to be lenient in his accusation if the revelation must be made
i deferred it however till the evening when my spirits were more composed and whenoh wonderful perversity of human naturesome faint germs of indefinite hopes were beginning to rise in my mind not that i intended to cherish them after all that had been said on the subject but there they must lie for a while uncrushed though not encouraged till i had learnt to live without them
arrived at woodford the young squires abode i found no little difficulty in obtaining admission to his presence
the servant that opened the door told me his master was very ill and seemed to think it doubtful whether he would be able to see me
i was not going to be baulked however
i waited calmly in the hall to be announced but inwardly determined to take no denial
the message was such as i expecteda polite intimation that mr lawrence could see no one he was feverish and must not be disturbed
i shall not disturb him long said i but i must see him for a moment it is on business of importance that i wish to speak to him ill tell him sir said the man
and i advanced further into the hall and followed him nearly to the door of the apartment where his master wasfor it seemed he was not in bed
the answer returned was that mr lawrence hoped i would be so good as to leave a message or a note with the servant as he could attend to no business at present
he may as well see me as you said i and stepping past the astonished footman i boldly rapped at the door entered and closed it behind me
the room was spacious and handsomely furnishedvery comfortably too for a bachelor
a clear red fire was burning in the polished grate a superannuated greyhound given up to idleness and good living lay basking before it on the thick soft rug on one corner of which beside the sofa sat a smart young springer looking wistfully up in its masters faceperhaps asking permission to share his couch or it might be only soliciting a caress from his hand or a kind word from his lips
the invalid himself looked very interesting as he lay reclining there in his elegant dressinggown with a silk handkerchief bound across his temples
his usually pale face was flushed and feverish his eyes were half closed until he became sensible of my presenceand then he opened them wide enough one hand was thrown listlessly over the back of the sofa and held a small volume with which apparently he had been vainly attempting to beguile the weary hours
he dropped it however in his start of indignant surprise as i advanced into the room and stood before him on the rug
he raised himself on his pillows and gazed upon me with equal degrees of nervous horror anger and amazement depicted on his countenance
mr
markham i scarcely expected this he said and the blood left his cheek as he spoke
i know you didnt answered i but be quiet a minute and ill tell you what i came for unthinkingly i advanced a step or two nearer
he winced at my approach with an expression of aversion and instinctive physical fear anything but conciliatory to my feelings
i stepped back however
make your story a short one said he putting his hand on the small silver bell that stood on the table beside him or i shall be obliged to call for assistance
i am in no state to bear your brutalities now or your presence either and in truth the moisture started from his pores and stood on his pale forehead like dew
such a reception was hardly calculated to diminish the difficulties of my unenviable task
it must be performed however in some fashion and so i plunged into it at once and floundered through it as i could
the truth is lawrence said i i have not acted quite correctly towards you of lateespecially on this last occasion and im come toin short to express my regret for what has been done and to beg your pardon
if you dont choose to grant it i added hastily not liking the aspect of his face its no matter only ive done my dutythats all its easily done replied he with a faint smile bordering on a sneer to abuse your friend and knock him on the head without any assignable cause and then tell him the deed was not quite correct but its no matter whether he pardons it or not i forgot to tell you that it was in consequence of a mistakemuttered i
i should have made a very handsome apology but you provoked me so confoundedly with your
well i suppose its my fault
the fact is i didnt know that you were mrs grahams brother and i saw and heard some things respecting your conduct towards her which were calculated to awaken unpleasant suspicions that allow me to say a little candour and confidence on your part might have removed and at last i chanced to overhear a part of a conversation between you and her that made me think i had a right to hate you and how came you to know that i was her brother asked he in some anxiety
she told me herself
she told me all
she knew i might be trusted
but you neednt disturb yourself about that mr lawrence for ive seen the last of her the last
is she gone then no but she has bid adieu to me and i have promised never to go near that house again while she inhabits it i could have groaned aloud at the bitter thoughts awakened by this turn in the discourse
but i only clenched my hands and stamped my foot upon the rug
my companion however was evidently relieved
you have done right he said in a tone of unqualified approbation while his face brightened into almost a sunny expression
and as for the mistake i am sorry for both our sakes that it should have occurred
perhaps you can forgive my want of candour and remember as some partial mitigation of the offence how little encouragement to friendly confidence you have given me of late yes yesi remember it all nobody can blame me more than i blame myself in my own heart at any rate nobody can regret more sincerely than i do the result of my brutality as you rightly term it never mind that said he faintly smiling let us forget all unpleasant words on both sides as well as deeds and consign to oblivion everything that we have cause to regret
have you any objection to take my hand or youd rather not it trembled through weakness as he held it out and dropped before i had time to catch it and give it a hearty squeeze which he had not the strength to return
how dry and burning your hand is lawrence said i
you are really ill and i have made you worse by all this talk oh it is nothing only a cold got by the rain my doing too never mind that
but tell me did you mention this affair to my sister to confess the truth i had not the courage to do so but when you tell her will you just say that i deeply regret it and oh never fear
i shall say nothing against you as long as you keep your good resolution of remaining aloof from her
she has not heard of my illness then that you are aware of i think not im glad of that for i have been all this time tormenting myself with the fear that somebody would tell her i was dying or desperately ill and she would be either distressing herself on account of her inability to hear from me or do me any good or perhaps committing the madness of coming to see me
i must contrive to let her know something about it if i can continued he reflectively or she will be hearing some such story
many would be glad to tell her such news just to see how she would take it and then she might expose herself to fresh scandal i wish i had told her said i
if it were not for my promise i would tell her now by no means
i am not dreaming of thatbut if i were to write a short note now not mentioning you markham but just giving a slight account of my illness by way of excuse for my not coming to see her and to put her on her guard against any exaggerated reports she may hearand address it in a disguised handwould you do me the favour to slip it into the postoffice as you pass
for i dare not trust any of the servants in such a case most willingly i consented and immediately brought him his desk
there was little need to disguise his hand for the poor fellow seemed to have considerable difficulty in writing at all so as to be legible
when the note was done i thought it time to retire and took leave after asking if there was anything in the world i could do for him little or great in the way of alleviating his sufferings and repairing the injury i had done
no said he you have already done much towards it you have done more for me than the most skilful physician could do for you have relieved my mind of two great burdensanxiety on my sisters account and deep regret upon your own for i do believe these two sources of torment have had more effect in working me up into a fever than anything else and i am persuaded i shall soon recover now
there is one more thing you can do for me and that is come and see me now and thenfor you see i am very lonely here and i promise your entrance shall not be disputed again i engaged to do so and departed with a cordial pressure of the hand
i posted the letter on my way home most manfully resisting the temptation of dropping in a word from myself at the same time
i felt strongly tempted at times to enlighten my mother and sister on the real character and circumstances of the persecuted tenant of wildfell hall and at first i greatly regretted having omitted to ask that ladys permission to do so but on due reflection i considered that if it were known to them it could not long remain a secret to the millwards and wilsons and such was my present appreciation of eliza millwards disposition that if once she got a clue to the story i should fear she would soon find means to enlighten mr huntingdon upon the place of his wifes retreat
i would therefore wait patiently till these weary six months were over and then when the fugitive had found another home and i was permitted to write to her i would beg to be allowed to clear her name from these vile calumnies at present i must content myself with simply asserting that i knew them to be false and would prove it some day to the shame of those who slandered her
i dont think anybody believed me but everybody soon learned to avoid insinuating a word against her or even mentioning her name in my presence
they thought i was so madly infatuated by the seductions of that unhappy lady that i was determined to support her in the very face of reason and meantime i grow insupportably morose and misanthropical from the idea that every one i met was harbouring unworthy thoughts of the supposed mrs graham and would express them if he dared
my poor mother was quite distressed about me but i couldnt help itat least i thought i could not though sometimes i felt a pang of remorse for my undutiful conduct to her and made an effort to amend attended with some partial success and indeed i was generally more humanised in my demeanour to her than to any one else mr lawrence excepted
rose and fergus usually shunned my presence and it was well they did for i was not fit company for them nor they for me under the present circumstances
mrs huntingdon did not leave wildfell hall till above two months after our farewell interview
during that time she never appeared at church and i never went near the house i only knew she was still there by her brothers brief answers to my many and varied inquiries respecting her
i was a very constant and attentive visitor to him throughout the whole period of his illness and convalescence not only from the interest i took in his recovery and my desire to cheer him up and make the utmost possible amends for my former brutality but from my growing attachment to himself and the increasing pleasure i found in his societypartly from his increased cordiality to me but chiefly on account of his close connection both in blood and in affection with my adored helen
i loved him for it better than i liked to express and i took a secret delight in pressing those slender white fingers so marvellously like her own considering he was not a woman and in watching the passing changes in his fair pale features and observing the intonations of his voice detecting resemblances which i wondered had never struck me before
he provoked me at times indeed by his evident reluctance to talk to me about his sister though i did not question the friendliness of his motives in wishing to discourage my remembrance of her
his recovery was not quite so rapid as he had expected it to be he was not able to mount his pony till a fortnight after the date of our reconciliation and the first use he made of his returning strength was to ride over by night to wildfell hall to see his sister
it was a hazardous enterprise both for him and for her but he thought it necessary to consult with her on the subject of her projected departure if not to calm her apprehensions respecting his health and the worst result was a slight relapse of his illness for no one knew of the visit but the inmates of the old hall except myself and i believe it had not been his intention to mention it to me for when i came to see him the next day and observed he was not so well as he ought to have been he merely said he had caught cold by being out too late in the evening
youll never be able to see your sister if you dont take care of yourself said i a little provoked at the circumstance on her account instead of commiserating him
ive seen her already said he quietly
youve seen her cried i in astonishment
yes and then he told me what considerations had impelled him to make the venture and with what precautions he had made it
and how was she i eagerly asked
as usual was the brief though sad reply
as usualthat is far from happy and far from strong she is not positively ill returned he and she will recover her spirits in a while i have no doubtbut so many trials have been almost too much for her
how threatening those clouds look continued he turning towards the window
we shall have thundershowers before night i imagine and they are just in the midst of stacking my corn
have you got yours all in yet no
and lawrence did shedid your sister mention me she asked if i had seen you lately and what else did she say i cannot tell you all she said replied he with a slight smile for we talked a good deal though my stay was but short but our conversation was chiefly on the subject of her intended departure which i begged her to delay till i was better able to assist her in her search after another home but did she say no more about me she did not say much about you markham
i should not have encouraged her to do so had she been inclined but happily she was not she only asked a few questions concerning you and seemed satisfied with my brief answers wherein she showed herself wiser than her friend and i may tell you too that she seemed to be far more anxious lest you should think too much of her than lest you should forget her she was right but i fear your anxiety is quite the other way respecting her no it is not i wish her to be happy but i dont wish her to forget me altogether
she knows it is impossible that i should forget her and she is right to wish me not to remember her too well
i should not desire her to regret me too deeply but i can scarcely imagine she will make herself very unhappy about me because i know i am not worthy of it except in my appreciation of her you are neither of you worthy of a broken heartnor of all the sighs and tears and sorrowful thoughts that have been and i fear will be wasted upon you both but at present each has a more exalted opinion of the other than i fear he or she deserves and my sisters feelings are naturally full as keen as yours and i believe more constant but she has the good sense and fortitude to strive against them in this particular and i trust she will not rest till she has entirely weaned her thoughts he hesitated
from me said i
and i wish you would make the like exertions continued he
did she tell you that that was her intention no the question was not broached between us there was no necessity for it for i had no doubt that such was her determination to forget me yes markham
why not oh well was my only audible reply but i internally answeredno lawrence youre wrong there she is not determined to forget me
it would be wrong to forget one so deeply and fondly devoted to her who can so thoroughly appreciate her excellencies and sympathise with all her thoughts as i can do and it would be wrong in me to forget so excellent and divine a piece of gods creation as she when i have once so truly loved and known her but i said no more to him on that subject
i instantly started a new topic of conversation and soon took leave of my companion with a feeling of less cordiality towards him than usual
perhaps i had no right to be annoyed at him but i was so nevertheless
in little more than a week after this i met him returning from a visit to the wilsons and i now resolved to do him a good turn though at the expense of his feelings and perhaps at the risk of incurring that displeasure which is so commonly the reward of those who give disagreeable information or tender their advice unasked
in this believe me i was actuated by no motives of revenge for the occasional annoyances i had lately sustained from himnor yet by any feeling of malevolent enmity towards miss wilson but purely by the fact that i could not endure that such a woman should be mrs huntingdons sister and that as well for his own sake as for hers i could not bear to think of his being deceived into a union with one so unworthy of him and so utterly unfitted to be the partner of his quiet home and the companion of his life
he had had uncomfortable suspicions on that head himself i imagined but such was his inexperience and such were the ladys powers of attraction and her skill in bringing them to bear upon his young imagination that they had not disturbed him long and i believe the only effectual causes of the vacillating indecision that had preserved him hitherto from making an actual declaration of love was the consideration of her connections and especially of her mother whom he could not abide
had they lived at a distance he might have surmounted the objection but within two or three miles of woodford it was really no light matter
youve been to call on the wilsons lawrence said i as i walked beside his pony
yes replied he slightly averting his face i thought it but civil to take the first opportunity of returning their kind attentions since they have been so very particular and constant in their inquiries throughout the whole course of my illness its all miss wilsons doing and if it is returned he with a very perceptible blush is that any reason why i should not make a suitable acknowledgment it is a reason why you should not make the acknowledgment she looks for let us drop that subject if you please said he in evident displeasure
no lawrence with your leave well continue it a while longer and ill tell you something now were about it which you may believe or not as you chooseonly please to remember that it is not my custom to speak falsely and that in this case i can have no motive for misrepresenting the truth well markham what now miss wilson hates your sister it may be natural enough that in her ignorance of the relationship she should feel some degree of enmity against her but no good or amiable woman would be capable of evincing that bitter coldblooded designing malice towards a fancied rival that i have observed in her markham yesand it is my belief that eliza millward and she if not the very originators of the slanderous reports that have been propagated were designedly the encouragers and chief disseminators of them
she was not desirous to mix up your name in the matter of course but her delight was and still is to blacken your sisters character to the utmost of her power without risking too greatly the exposure of her own malevolence i cannot believe it interrupted my companion his face burning with indignation
well as i cannot prove it i must content myself with asserting that it is so to the best of my belief but as you would not willingly marry miss wilson if it were so you will do well to be cautious till you have proved it to be otherwise i never told you markham that i intended to marry miss wilson said he proudly
no but whether you do or not she intends to marry you did she tell you so no but then you have no right to make such an assertion respecting her he slightly quickened his ponys pace but i laid my hand on its mane determined he should not leave me yet
wait a moment lawrence and let me explain myself and dont be so veryi dont know what to call itinaccessible as you arei know what you think of jane wilson and i believe i know how far you are mistaken in your opinion you think she is singularly charming elegant sensible and refined you are not aware that she is selfish coldhearted ambitious artful shallowminded enough markhamenough no let me finishyou dont know that if you married her your home would be rayless and comfortless and it would break your heart at last to find yourself united to one so wholly incapable of sharing your tastes feelings and ideasso utterly destitute of sensibility good feeling and true nobility of soul have you done asked my companion quietly
yesi know you hate me for my impertinence but i dont care if it only conduces to preserve you from that fatal mistake well returned he with a rather wintry smileim glad you have overcome or forgotten your own afflictions so far as to be able to study so deeply the affairs of others and trouble your head so unnecessarily about the fancied or possible calamities of their future life we partedsomewhat coldly again but still we did not cease to be friends and my wellmeant warning though it might have been more judiciously delivered as well as more thankfully received was not wholly unproductive of the desired effect his visit to the wilsons was not repeated and though in our subsequent interviews he never mentioned her name to me nor i to himi have reason to believe he pondered my words in his mind eagerly though covertly sought information respecting the fair lady from other quarters secretly compared my character of her with what he had himself observed and what he heard from others and finally came to the conclusion that all things considered she had much better remain miss wilson of ryecote farm than be transmuted into mrs lawrence of woodford hall
i believe too that he soon learned to contemplate with secret amazement his former predilection and to congratulate himself on the lucky escape he had made but he never confessed it to me or hinted one word of acknowledgment for the part i had had in his deliverance but this was not surprising to any one that knew him as i did
as for jane wilson she of course was disappointed and embittered by the sudden cold neglect and ultimate desertion of her former admirer
had i done wrong to blight her cherished hopes
i think not and certainly my conscience has never accused me from that day to this of any evil design in the matter
one morning about the beginning of november while i was inditing some business letters shortly after breakfast eliza millward came to call upon my sister
rose had neither the discrimination nor the virulence to regard the little demon as i did and they still preserved their former intimacy
at the moment of her arrival however there was no one in the room but fergus and myself my mother and sister being both of them absent on household cares intent but i was not going to lay myself out for her amusement whoever else might so incline i merely honoured her with a careless salutation and a few words of course and then went on with my writing leaving my brother to be more polite if he chose
but she wanted to tease me
what a pleasure it is to find you at home mr markham said she with a disingenuously malicious smile
i so seldom see you now for you never come to the vicarage
papa is quite offended i can tell you she added playfully looking into my face with an impertinent laugh as she seated herself half beside and half before my desk off the corner of the table
i have had a good deal to do of late said i without looking up from my letter
have you indeed
somebody said you had been strangely neglecting your business these last few months somebody said wrong for these last two months especially i have been particularly plodding and diligent ah
well theres nothing like active employment i suppose to console the afflictedand excuse me mr markham but you look so very far from well and have been by all accounts so moody and thoughtful of latei could almost think you have some secret care preying on your spirits
formerly said she timidly i could have ventured to ask you what it was and what i could do to comfort you i dare not do it now youre very kind miss eliza
when i think you can do anything to comfort me ill make bold to tell you pray doi suppose i maynt guess what it is that troubles you theres no necessity for ill tell you plainly
the thing that troubles me the most at present is a young lady sitting at my elbow and preventing me from finishing my letter and thereafter repairing to my daily business before she could reply to this ungallant speech rose entered the room and miss eliza rising to greet her they both seated themselves near the fire where that idle lad fergus was standing leaning his shoulder against the corner of the chimneypiece with his legs crossed and his hands in his breechespockets
now rose ill tell you a piece of newsi hope you have not heard it before for good bad or indifferent one always likes to be the first to tell
its about that sad mrs graham hushshsh whispered fergus in a tone of solemn import
we never mention her her name is never heard and glancing up i caught him with his eye askance on me and his finger pointed to his forehead then winking at the young lady with a doleful shake of the head he whispereda monomaniabut dont mention itall right but that i should be sorry to injure any ones feelings returned she speaking below her breath
another time perhaps speak out miss eliza said i not deigning to notice the others buffooneries you neednt fear to say anything in my presence well answered she perhaps you know already that mrs grahams husband is not really dead and that she had run away from him i started and felt my face glow but i bent it over my letter and went on folding it up as she proceeded
but perhaps you did not know that she is now gone back to him again and that a perfect reconciliation has taken place between them
only think she continued turning to the confounded rose what a fool the man must be and who gave you this piece of intelligence miss eliza said i interrupting my sisters exclamations
i had it from a very authentic source from whom may i ask from one of the servants at woodford oh
i was not aware that you were on such intimate terms with mr lawrences household it was not from the man himself that i heard it but he told it in confidence to our maid sarah and sarah told it to me in confidence i suppose
and you tell it in confidence to us
but i can tell you that it is but a lame story after all and scarcely onehalf of it true while i spoke i completed the sealing and direction of my letters with a somewhat unsteady hand in spite of all my efforts to retain composure and in spite of my firm conviction that the story was a lame onethat the supposed mrs graham most certainly had not voluntarily gone back to her husband or dreamt of a reconciliation
most likely she was gone away and the talebearing servant not knowing what was become of her had conjectured that such was the case and our fair visitor had detailed it as a certainty delighted with such an opportunity of tormenting me
but it was possiblebarely possiblethat some one might have betrayed her and she had been taken away by force
determined to know the worst i hastily pocketed my two letters and muttered something about being too late for the post left the room rushed into the yard and vociferously called for my horse
no one being there i dragged him out of the stable myself strapped the saddle on to his back and the bridle on to his head mounted and speedily galloped away to woodford
i found its owner pensively strolling in the grounds
is your sister gone were my first words as i grasped his hand instead of the usual inquiry after his health
yes shes gone was his answer so calmly spoken that my terror was at once removed
i suppose i maynt know where she is said i as i dismounted and relinquished my horse to the gardener who being the only servant within call had been summoned by his master from his employment of raking up the dead leaves on the lawn to take him to the stables
my companion gravely took my arm and leading me away to the garden thus answered my questionshe is at grassdale manor in shire where cried i with a convulsive start
at grassdale manor how was it i gasped
who betrayed her she went of her own accord impossible lawrence
she could not be so frantic exclaimed i vehemently grasping his arm as if to force him to unsay those hateful words
she did persisted he in the same grave collected manner as before and not without reason he continued gently disengaging himself from my grasp
mr
huntingdon is ill and so she went to nurse him yes fool i could not help exclaiming and lawrence looked up with a rather reproachful glance
is he dying then i think not markham and how many more nurses has he
how many ladies are there besides to take care of him none he was alone or she would not have gone oh confound it
this is intolerable what is
that he should be alone i attempted no reply for i was not sure that this circumstance did not partly conduce to my distraction
i therefore continued to pace the walk in silent anguish with my hand pressed to my forehead then suddenly pausing and turning to my companion i impatiently exclaimed why did she take this infatuated step
what fiend persuaded her to it nothing persuaded her but her own sense of duty humbug i was half inclined to say so myself markham at first
i assure you it was not by my advice that she went for i detest that man as fervently as you can doexcept indeed that his reformation would give me much greater pleasure than his death but all i did was to inform her of the circumstance of his illness the consequence of a fall from his horse in hunting and to tell her that that unhappy person miss myers had left him some time ago it was ill done
now when he finds the convenience of her presence he will make all manner of lying speeches and false fair promises for the future and she will believe him and then her condition will be ten times worse and ten times more irremediable than before there does not appear to be much ground for such apprehensions at present said he producing a letter from his pocket
from the account i received this morning i should say it was her writing
by an irresistible impulse i held out my hand and the words let me see it involuntarily passed my lips
he was evidently reluctant to grant the request but while he hesitated i snatched it from his hand
recollecting myself however the minute after i offered to restore it
here take it said i if you dont want me to read it no replied he you may read it if you like i read it and so may you
grassdale nov th
dear fredericki know you will be anxious to hear from me and i will tell you all i can
mr huntingdon is very ill but not dying or in any immediate danger and he is rather better at present than he was when i came
i found the house in sad confusion mrs greaves benson every decent servant had left and those that were come to supply their places were a negligent disorderly set to say no worsei must change them again if i stay
a professional nurse a grim hard old woman had been hired to attend the wretched invalid
he suffers much and has no fortitude to bear him through
the immediate injuries he sustained from the accident however were not very severe and would as the doctor says have been but trifling to a man of temperate habits but with him it is very different
on the night of my arrival when i first entered his room he was lying in a kind of half delirium
he did not notice me till i spoke and then he mistook me for another
is it you alice come again he murmured
what did you leave me for it is i arthurit is helen your wife i replied
my wife said he with a start
for heavens sake dont mention heri have none
devil take her he cried a moment after and you too
what did you do it for i said no more but observing that he kept gazing towards the foot of the bed i went and sat there placing the light so as to shine full upon me for i thought he might be dying and i wanted him to know me
for a long time he lay silently looking upon me first with a vacant stare then with a fixed gaze of strange growing intensity
at last he startled me by suddenly raising himself on his elbow and demanding in a horrified whisper with his eyes still fixed upon me who is it it is helen huntingdon said i quietly rising at the same time and removing to a less conspicuous position
i must be going mad cried he or somethingdelirious perhaps but leave me whoever you are
i cant bear that white face and those eyes
for gods sake go and send me somebody else that doesnt look like that i went at once and sent the hired nurse but next morning i ventured to enter his chamber again and taking the nurses place by his bedside i watched him and waited on him for several hours showing myself as little as possible and only speaking when necessary and then not above my breath
at first he addressed me as the nurse but on my crossing the room to draw up the windowblinds in obedience to his directions he said no it isnt nurse its alice
stay with me do
that old hag will be the death of me i mean to stay with you said i
and after that he would call me alice or some other name almost equally repugnant to my feelings
i forced myself to endure it for a while fearing a contradiction might disturb him too much but when having asked for a glass of water while i held it to his lips he murmured thanks dearest i could not help distinctly observing you would not say so if you knew me intending to follow that up with another declaration of my identity but he merely muttered an incoherent reply so i dropped it again till some time after when as i was bathing his forehead and temples with vinegar and water to relieve the heat and pain in his head he observed after looking earnestly upon me for some minutes i have such strange fanciesi cant get rid of them and they wont let me rest and the most singular and pertinacious of them all is your face and voicethey seem just like hers
i could swear at this moment that she was by my side she is said i
that seems comfortable continued he without noticing my words and while you do it the other fancies fade awaybut this only strengthensgo ongo on till it vanishes too
i cant stand such a mania as this it would kill me it never will vanish said i distinctly for it is the truth the truth he cried starting as if an asp had stung him
you dont mean to say that you are really she i do but you neednt shrink away from me as if i were your greatest enemy i am come to take care of you and do what none of them would do for gods sake dont torment me now cried he in pitiable agitation and then he began to mutter bitter curses against me or the evil fortune that had brought me there while i put down the sponge and basin and resumed my seat at the bedside
where are they said he have they all left meservants and all there are servants within call if you want them but you had better lie down now and be quiet none of them could or would attend you as carefully as i shall do i cant understand it at all said he in bewildered perplexity
was it a dream that and he covered his eyes with his hands as if trying to unravel the mystery
no arthur it was not a dream that your conduct was such as to oblige me to leave you but i heard that you were ill and alone and i am come back to nurse you
you need not fear to trust me tell me all your wants and i will try to satisfy them
there is no one else to care for you and i shall not upbraid you now oh
i see said he with a bitter smile its an act of christian charity whereby you hope to gain a higher seat in heaven for yourself and scoop a deeper pit in hell for me no i came to offer you that comfort and assistance your situation required and if i could benefit your soul as well as your body and awaken some sense of contrition and oh yes if you could overwhelm me with remorse and confusion of face nows the time
what have you done with my son he is well and you may see him some time if you will compose yourself but not now where is he he is safe is he here wherever he is you will not see him till you have promised to leave him entirely under my care and protection and to let me take him away whenever and wherever i please if i should hereafter judge it necessary to remove him again
but we will talk of that tomorrow you must be quiet now no let me see him now i promise if it must be so no i swear it as god is in heaven
now then let me see him but i cannot trust your oaths and promises i must have a written agreement and you must sign it in presence of a witness but not todaytomorrow no today now persisted he and he was in such a state of feverish excitement and so bent upon the immediate gratification of his wish that i thought it better to grant it at once as i saw he would not rest till i did
but i was determined my sons interest should not be forgotten and having clearly written out the promise i wished mr huntingdon to give upon a slip of paper i deliberately read it over to him and made him sign it in the presence of rachel
he begged i would not insist upon this it was a useless exposure of my want of faith in his word to the servant
i told him i was sorry but since he had forfeited my confidence he must take the consequence
he next pleaded inability to hold the pen
then we must wait until you can hold it said i
upon which he said he would try but then he could not see to write
i placed my finger where the signature was to be and told him he might write his name in the dark if he only knew where to put it
but he had not power to form the letters
in that case you must be too ill to see the child said i and finding me inexorable he at length managed to ratify the agreement and i bade rachel send the boy
all this may strike you as harsh but i felt i must not lose my present advantage and my sons future welfare should not be sacrificed to any mistaken tenderness for this mans feelings
little arthur had not forgotten his father but thirteen months of absence during which he had seldom been permitted to hear a word about him or hardly to whisper his name had rendered him somewhat shy and when he was ushered into the darkened room where the sick man lay so altered from his former self with fiercely flushed face and wildlygleaming eyeshe instinctively clung to me and stood looking on his father with a countenance expressive of far more awe than pleasure
come here arthur said the latter extending his hand towards him
the child went and timidly touched that burning hand but almost started in alarm when his father suddenly clutched his arm and drew him nearer to his side
do you know me asked mr huntingdon intently perusing his features
yes who am i papa are you glad to see me yes youre not replied the disappointed parent relaxing his hold and darting a vindictive glance at me
arthur thus released crept back to me and put his hand in mine
his father swore i had made the child hate him and abused and cursed me bitterly
the instant he began i sent our son out of the room and when he paused to breathe i calmly assured him that he was entirely mistaken i had never once attempted to prejudice his child against him
i did indeed desire him to forget you i said and especially to forget the lessons you taught him and for that cause and to lessen the danger of discovery i own i have generally discouraged his inclination to talk about you but no one can blame me for that i think the invalid only replied by groaning aloud and rolling his head on a pillow in a paroxysm of impatience
i am in hell already cried he
this cursed thirst is burning my heart to ashes
will nobody before he could finish the sentence i had poured out a glass of some acidulated cooling drink that was on the table and brought it to him
he drank it greedily but muttered as i took away the glassi suppose youre heaping coals of fire on my head you think not noticing this speech i asked if there was anything else i could do for him
yes ill give you another opportunity of showing your christian magnanimity sneered he set my pillow straight and these confounded bedclothes i did so
there now get me another glass of that slop i complied
this is delightful isnt it said he with a malicious grin as i held it to his lips you never hoped for such a glorious opportunity now shall i stay with you said i as i replaced the glass on the table or will you be more quiet if i go and send the nurse oh yes youre wondrous gentle and obliging
but youve driven me mad with it all responded he with an impatient toss
ill leave you then said i and i withdrew and did not trouble him with my presence again that day except for a minute or two at a time just to see how he was and what he wanted
next morning the doctor ordered him to be bled and after that he was more subdued and tranquil
i passed half the day in his room at different intervals
my presence did not appear to agitate or irritate him as before and he accepted my services quietly without any bitter remarks indeed he scarcely spoke at all except to make known his wants and hardly then
but on the morrow that is to say in proportion as he recovered from the state of exhaustion and stupefaction his illnature appeared to revive
oh this sweet revenge cried he when i had been doing all i could to make him comfortable and to remedy the carelessness of his nurse
and you can enjoy it with such a quiet conscience too because its all in the way of duty it is well for me that i am doing my duty said i with a bitterness i could not repress for it is the only comfort i have and the satisfaction of my own conscience it seems is the only reward i need look for he looked rather surprised at the earnestness of my manner
what reward did you look for he asked
you will think me a liar if i tell you but i did hope to benefit you as well to better your mind as to alleviate your present sufferings but it appears i am to do neither your own bad spirit will not let me
as far as you are concerned i have sacrificed my own feelings and all the little earthly comfort that was left me to no purpose and every little thing i do for you is ascribed to selfrighteous malice and refined revenge its all very fine i daresay said he eyeing me with stupid amazement and of course i ought to be melted to tears of penitence and admiration at the sight of so much generosity and superhuman goodness but you see i cant manage it
however pray do me all the good you can if you do really find any pleasure in it for you perceive i am almost as miserable just now as you need wish to see me
since you came i confess i have had better attendance than before for these wretches neglected me shamefully and all my old friends seem to have fairly forsaken me
ive had a dreadful time of it i assure you i sometimes thought i should have died do you think theres any chance theres always a chance of death and it is always well to live with such a chance in view yes yes
but do you think theres any likelihood that this illness will have a fatal termination i cannot tell but supposing it should how are you prepared to meet the event why the doctor told me i wasnt to think about it for i was sure to get better if i stuck to his regimen and prescriptions i hope you may arthur but neither the doctor nor i can speak with certainty in such a case there is internal injury and it is difficult to know to what extent there now
you want to scare me to death no but i dont want to lull you to false security
if a consciousness of the uncertainty of life can dispose you to serious and useful thoughts i would not deprive you of the benefit of such reflections whether you do eventually recover or not
does the idea of death appal you very much its just the only thing i cant bear to think of so if youve any but it must come some time interrupted i and if it be years hence it will as certainly overtake you as if it came todayand no doubt be as unwelcome then as now unless you oh hang it
dont torment me with your preachments now unless you want to kill me outright
i cant stand it i tell you
ive sufferings enough without that
if you think theres danger save me from it and then in gratitude ill hear whatever you like to say i accordingly dropped the unwelcome topic
and now frederick i think i may bring my letter to a close
from these details you may form your own judgment of the state of my patient and of my own position and future prospects
let me hear from you soon and i will write again to tell you how we get on but now that my presence is tolerated and even required in the sickroom i shall have but little time to spare between my husband and my sonfor i must not entirely neglect the latter it would not do to keep him always with rachel and i dare not leave him for a moment with any of the other servants or suffer him to be alone lest he should meet them
if his father get worse i shall ask esther hargrave to take charge of him for a time till i have reorganised the household at least but i greatly prefer keeping him under my own eye
i find myself in rather a singular position i am exerting my utmost endeavours to promote the recovery and reformation of my husband and if i succeed what shall i do
my duty of coursebut how
no matter i can perform the task that is before me now and god will give me strength to do whatever he requires hereafter
goodby dear frederick
helen huntingdon
what do you think of it said lawrence as i silently refolded the letter
it seems to me returned i that she is casting her pearls before swine
may they be satisfied with trampling them under their feet and not turn again and rend her
but i shall say no more against her i see that she was actuated by the best and noblest motives in what she has done and if the act is not a wise one may heaven protect her from its consequences
may i keep this letter lawrenceyou see she has never once mentioned me throughoutor made the most distant allusion to me therefore there can be no impropriety or harm in it and therefore why should you wish to keep it were not these characters written by her hand
and were not these words conceived in her mind and many of them spoken by her lips well said he
and so i kept it otherwise halford you could never have become so thoroughly acquainted with its contents
and when you write said i will you have the goodness to ask her if i may be permitted to enlighten my mother and sister on her real history and circumstance just so far as is necessary to make the neighbourhood sensible of the shameful injustice they have done her
i want no tender messages but just ask her that and tell her it is the greatest favour she could do me and tell herno nothing more
you see i know the address and i might write to her myself but i am so virtuous as to refrain well ill do this for you markham and as soon as you receive an answer youll let me know if all be well ill come myself and tell you immediately five or six days after this mr lawrence paid us the honour of a call and when he and i were alone togetherwhich i contrived as soon as possible by bringing him out to look at my cornstackshe showed me another letter from his sister
this one he was quite willing to submit to my longing gaze he thought i suppose it would do me good
the only answer it gave to my message was this mr
markham is at liberty to make such revelations concerning me as he judges necessary
he will know that i should wish but little to be said on the subject
i hope he is well but tell him he must not think of me i can give you a few extracts from the rest of the letter for i was permitted to keep this alsoperhaps as an antidote to all pernicious hopes and fancies
he is decidedly better but very low from the depressing effects of his severe illness and the strict regimen he is obliged to observeso opposite to all his previous habits
it is deplorable to see how completely his past life has degenerated his once noble constitution and vitiated the whole system of his organization
but the doctor says he may now be considered out of danger if he will only continue to observe the necessary restrictions
some stimulating cordials he must have but they should be judiciously diluted and sparingly used and i find it very difficult to keep him to this
at first his extreme dread of death rendered the task an easy one but in proportion as he feels his acute suffering abating and sees the danger receding the more intractable he becomes
now also his appetite for food is beginning to return and here too his long habits of selfindulgence are greatly against him
i watch and restrain him as well as i can and often get bitterly abused for my rigid severity and sometimes he contrives to elude my vigilance and sometimes acts in opposition to my will
but he is now so completely reconciled to my attendance in general that he is never satisfied when i am not by his side
i am obliged to be a little stiff with him sometimes or he would make a complete slave of me and i know it would be unpardonable weakness to give up all other interests for him
i have the servants to overlook and my little arthur to attend toand my own health too all of which would be entirely neglected were i to satisfy his exorbitant demands
i do not generally sit up at night for i think the nurse who has made it her business is better qualified for such undertakings than i ambut still an unbroken nights rest is what i but seldom enjoy and never can venture to reckon upon for my patient makes no scruple of calling me up at an hour when his wants or his fancies require my presence
but he is manifestly afraid of my displeasure and if at one time he tries my patience by his unreasonable exactions and fretful complaints and reproaches at another he depresses me by his abject submission and deprecatory selfabasement when he fears he has gone too far
but all this i can readily pardon i know it is chiefly the result of his enfeebled frame and disordered nerves
what annoys me the most is his occasional attempts at affectionate fondness that i can neither credit nor return not that i hate him his sufferings and my own laborious care have given him some claim to my regardto my affection even if he would only be quiet and sincere and content to let things remain as they are but the more he tries to conciliate me the more i shrink from him and from the future
helen what do you mean to do when i get well he asked this morning
will you run away again it entirely depends upon your own conduct oh ill be very good but if i find it necessary to leave you arthur i shall not run away you know i have your own promise that i may go whenever i please and take my son with me oh but you shall have no cause and then followed a variety of professions which i rather coldly checked
will you not forgive me then said he
yesi have forgiven you but i know you cannot love me as you once didand i should be very sorry if you were to for i could not pretend to return it so let us drop the subject and never recur to it again
by what i have done for you you may judge of what i will doif it be not incompatible with the higher duty i owe to my son higher because he never forfeited his claims and because i hope to do more good to him than i can ever do to you and if you wish me to feel kindly towards you it is deeds not words which must purchase my affection and esteem his sole reply to this was a slight grimace and a scarcely perceptible shrug
alas unhappy man
words with him are so much cheaper than deeds it was as if i had said pounds not pence must buy the article you want and then he sighed a querulous selfcommiserating sigh as if in pure regret that he the loved and courted of so many worshippers should be now abandoned to the mercy of a harsh exacting coldhearted woman like that and even glad of what kindness she chose to bestow
its a pity isnt it said i and whether i rightly divined his musings or not the observation chimed in with his thoughts for he answeredit cant be helped with a rueful smile at my penetration
i have seen esther hargrave twice
she is a charming creature but her blithe spirit is almost broken and her sweet temper almost spoiled by the still unremitting persecutions of her mother in behalf of her rejected suitornot violent but wearisome and unremitting like a continual dropping
the unnatural parent seems determined to make her daughters life a burden if she will not yield to her desires
mamma does all she can said she to make me feel myself a burden and incumbrance to the family and the most ungrateful selfish and undutiful daughter that ever was born and walter too is as stern and cold and haughty as if he hated me outright
i believe i should have yielded at once if i had known from the beginning how much resistance would have cost me but now for very obstinacys sake i will stand out a bad motive for a good resolve i answered
but however i know you have better motives really for your perseverance and i counsel you to keep them still in view trust me i will
i threaten mamma sometimes that ill run away and disgrace the family by earning my own livelihood if she torments me any more and then that frightens her a little
but i will do it in good earnest if they dont mind be quiet and patient a while said i and better times will come poor girl
i wish somebody that was worthy to possess her would come and take her awaydont you frederick
if the perusal of this letter filled me with dismay for helens future life and mine there was one great source of consolation it was now in my power to clear her name from every foul aspersion
the millwards and the wilsons should see with their own eyes the bright sun bursting from the cloudand they should be scorched and dazzled by its beamsand my own friends too should see itthey whose suspicions had been such gall and wormwood to my soul
to effect this i had only to drop the seed into the ground and it would soon become a stately branching herb a few words to my mother and sister i knew would suffice to spread the news throughout the whole neighbourhood without any further exertion on my part
rose was delighted and as soon as i had told her all i thought properwhich was all i affected to knowshe flew with alacrity to put on her bonnet and shawl and hasten to carry the glad tidings to the millwards and wilsonsglad tidings i suspect to none but herself and mary millwardthat steady sensible girl whose sterling worth had been so quickly perceived and duly valued by the supposed mrs graham in spite of her plain outside and who on her part had been better able to see and appreciate that ladys true character and qualities than the brightest genius among them
as i may never have occasion to mention her again i may as well tell you here that she was at this time privately engaged to richard wilsona secret i believe to every one but themselves
that worthy student was now at cambridge where his most exemplary conduct and his diligent perseverance in the pursuit of learning carried him safely through and eventually brought him with hardearned honours and an untarnished reputation to the close of his collegiate career
in due time he became mr millwards first and only curatefor that gentlemans declining years forced him at last to acknowledge that the duties of his extensive parish were a little too much for those vaunted energies which he was wont to boast over his younger and less active brethren of the cloth
this was what the patient faithful lovers had privately planned and quietly waited for years ago and in due time they were united to the astonishment of the little world they lived in that had long since declared them both born to single blessedness affirming it impossible that the pale retiring bookworm should ever summon courage to seek a wife or be able to obtain one if he did and equally impossible that the plainlooking plaindealing unattractive unconciliating miss millward should ever find a husband
they still continued to live at the vicarage the lady dividing her time between her father her husband and their poor parishionersand subsequently her rising family and now that the reverend michael millward has been gathered to his fathers full of years and honours the reverend richard wilson has succeeded him to the vicarage of lindenhope greatly to the satisfaction of its inhabitants who had so long tried and fully proved his merits and those of his excellent and wellloved partner
if you are interested in the after fate of that ladys sister i can only tell youwhat perhaps you have heard from another quarterthat some twelve or thirteen years ago she relieved the happy couple of her presence by marrying a wealthy tradesman of l and i dont envy him his bargain
i fear she leads him a rather uncomfortable life though happily he is too dull to perceive the extent of his misfortune
i have little enough to do with her myself we have not met for many years but i am well assured she has not yet forgotten or forgiven either her former lover or the lady whose superior qualities first opened his eyes to the folly of his boyish attachment
as for richard wilsons sister she having been wholly unable to recapture mr lawrence or obtain any partner rich and elegant enough to suit her ideas of what the husband of jane wilson ought to be is yet in single blessedness
shortly after the death of her mother she withdrew the light of her presence from ryecote farm finding it impossible any longer to endure the rough manners and unsophisticated habits of her honest brother robert and his worthy wife or the idea of being identified with such vulgar people in the eyes of the world and took lodgings in the county town where she lived and still lives i suppose in a kind of closefisted cold uncomfortable gentility doing no good to others and but little to herself spending her days in fancywork and scandal referring frequently to her brother the vicar and her sister the vicars lady but never to her brother the farmer and her sister the farmers wife seeing as much company as she can without too much expense but loving no one and beloved by nonea coldhearted supercilious keenly insidiously censorious old maid
though mr lawrences health was now quite reestablished my visits to woodford were as unremitting as ever though often less protracted than before
we seldom talked about mrs huntingdon but yet we never met without mentioning her for i never sought his company but with the hope of hearing something about her and he never sought mine at all because he saw me often enough without
but i always began to talk of other things and waited first to see if he would introduce the subject
if he did not i would casually ask have you heard from your sister lately if he said no the matter was dropped if he said yes i would venture to inquire how is she but never how is her husband though i might be burning to know because i had not the hypocrisy to profess any anxiety for his recovery and i had not the face to express any desire for a contrary result
had i any such desirei fear i must plead guilty but since you have heard my confession you must hear my justification as wella few of the excuses at least wherewith i sought to pacify my own accusing conscience
in the first place you see his life did harm to others and evidently no good to himself and though i wished it to terminate i would not have hastened its close if by the lifting of a finger i could have done so or if a spirit had whispered in my ear that a single effort of the will would be enoughunless indeed i had the power to exchange him for some other victim of the grave whose life might be of service to his race and whose death would be lamented by his friends
but was there any harm in wishing that among the many thousands whose souls would certainly be required of them before the year was over this wretched mortal might be one
i thought not and therefore i wished with all my heart that it might please heaven to remove him to a better world or if that might not be still to take him out of this for if he were unfit to answer the summons now after a warning sickness and with such an angel by his side it seemed but too certain that he never would bethat on the contrary returning health would bring returning lust and villainy and as he grew more certain of recovery more accustomed to her generous goodness his feelings would become more callous his heart more flinty and impervious to her persuasive argumentsbut god knew best
meantime however i could not but be anxious for the result of his decrees knowing as i did that leaving myself entirely out of the question however helen might feel interested in her husbands welfare however she might deplore his fate still while he lived she must be miserable
a fortnight passed away and my inquiries were always answered in the negative
at length a welcome yes drew from me the second question
lawrence divined my anxious thoughts and appreciated my reserve
i feared at first he was going to torture me by unsatisfactory replies and either leave me quite in the dark concerning what i wanted to know or force me to drag the information out of him morsel by morsel by direct inquiries
and serve you right you will say but he was more merciful and in a little while he put his sisters letter into my hand
i silently read it and restored it to him without comment or remark
this mode of procedure suited him so well that thereafter he always pursued the plan of showing me her letters at once when inquired after her if there were any to showit was so much less trouble than to tell me their contents and i received such confidences so quietly and discreetly that he was never induced to discontinue them
but i devoured those precious letters with my eyes and never let them go till their contents were stamped upon my mind and when i got home the most important passages were entered in my diary among the remarkable events of the day
the first of these communications brought intelligence of a serious relapse in mr huntingdons illness entirely the result of his own infatuation in persisting in the indulgence of his appetite for stimulating drink
in vain had she remonstrated in vain she had mingled his wine with water her arguments and entreaties were a nuisance her interference was an insult so intolerable that at length on finding she had covertly diluted the pale port that was brought him he threw the bottle out of the window swearing he would not be cheated like a baby ordered the butler on pain of instant dismissal to bring a bottle of the strongest wine in the cellar and affirming that he should have been well long ago if he had been let to have his own way but she wanted to keep him weak in order that she might have him under her thumbbut by the lord harry he would have no more humbugseized a glass in one hand and the bottle in the other and never rested till he had drunk it dry
alarming symptoms were the immediate result of this imprudence as she mildly termed itsymptoms which had rather increased than diminished since and this was the cause of her delay in writing to her brother
every former feature of his malady had returned with augmented virulence the slight external wound half healed had broken out afresh internal inflammation had taken place which might terminate fatally if not soon removed
of course the wretched sufferers temper was not improved by this calamityin fact i suspect it was well nigh insupportable though his kind nurse did not complain but she said she had been obliged at last to give her son in charge to esther hargrave as her presence was so constantly required in the sickroom that she could not possibly attend to him herself and though the child had begged to be allowed to continue with her there and to help her to nurse his papa and though she had no doubt he would have been very good and quiet she could not think of subjecting his young and tender feelings to the sight of so much suffering or of allowing him to witness his fathers impatience or hear the dreadful language he was wont to use in his paroxysms of pain or irritation
the latter continued she most deeply regrets the step that has occasioned his relapse but as usual he throws the blame upon me
if i had reasoned with him like a rational creature he says it never would have happened but to be treated like a baby or a fool was enough to put any man past his patience and drive him to assert his independence even at the sacrifice of his own interest
he forgets how often i had reasoned him past his patience before
he appears to be sensible of his danger but nothing can induce him to behold it in the proper light
the other night while i was waiting on him and just as i had brought him a draught to assuage his burning thirst he observed with a return of his former sarcastic bitterness yes youre mighty attentive now i suppose theres nothing you wouldnt do for me now you know said i a little surprised at his manner that i am willing to do anything i can to relieve you yes now my immaculate angel but when once you have secured your reward and find yourself safe in heaven and me howling in hellfire catch you lifting a finger to serve me then no youll look complacently on and not so much as dip the tip of your finger in water to cool my tongue if so it will be because of the great gulf over which i cannot pass and if i could look complacently on in such a case it would be only from the assurance that you were being purified from your sins and fitted to enjoy the happiness i feltbut are you determined arthur that i shall not meet you in heaven humph
what should i do there i should like to know indeed i cannot tell and i fear it is too certain that your tastes and feelings must be widely altered before you can have any enjoyment there
but do you prefer sinking without an effort into the state of torment you picture to yourself oh its all a fable said he contemptuously
are you sure arthur
are you quite sure
because if there is any doubt and if you should find yourself mistaken after all when it is too late to turn it would be rather awkward to be sure said he but dont bother me nowim not going to die yet
i cant and wont he added vehemently as if suddenly struck with the appalling aspect of that terrible event
helen you must save me and he earnestly seized my hand and looked into my face with such imploring eagerness that my heart bled for him and i could not speak for tears
the next letter brought intelligence that the malady was fast increasing and the poor sufferers horror of death was still more distressing than his impatience of bodily pain
all his friends had not forsaken him for mr hattersley hearing of his danger had come to see him from his distant home in the north
his wife had accompanied him as much for the pleasure of seeing her dear friend from whom she had been parted so long as to visit her mother and sister
mrs huntingdon expressed herself glad to see milicent once more and pleased to behold her so happy and well
she is now at the grove continued the letter but she often calls to see me
mr hattersley spends much of his time at arthurs bedside
with more good feeling than i gave him credit for he evinces considerable sympathy for his unhappy friend and is far more willing than able to comfort him
sometimes he tries to joke and laugh with him but that will not do sometimes he endeavours to cheer him with talk about old times and this at one time may serve to divert the sufferer from his own sad thoughts at another it will only plunge him into deeper melancholy than before and then hattersley is confounded and knows not what to say unless it be a timid suggestion that the clergyman might be sent for
but arthur will never consent to that he knows he has rejected the clergymans wellmeant admonitions with scoffing levity at other times and cannot dream of turning to him for consolation now
mr hattersley sometimes offers his services instead of mine but arthur will not let me go that strange whim still increases as his strength declinesthe fancy to have me always by his side
i hardly ever leave him except to go into the next room where i sometimes snatch an hour or so of sleep when he is quiet but even then the door is left ajar that he may know me to be within call
i am with him now while i write and i fear my occupation annoys him though i frequently break off to attend to him and though mr hattersley is also by his side
that gentleman came as he said to beg a holiday for me that i might have a run in the park this fine frosty morning with milicent and esther and little arthur whom he had driven over to see me
our poor invalid evidently felt it a heartless proposition and would have felt it still more heartless in me to accede to it
i therefore said i would only go and speak to them a minute and then come back
i did but exchange a few words with them just outside the portico inhaling the fresh bracing air as i stood and then resisting the earnest and eloquent entreaties of all three to stay a little longer and join them in a walk round the garden i tore myself away and returned to my patient
i had not been absent five minutes but he reproached me bitterly for my levity and neglect
his friend espoused my cause
nay nay huntingdon said he youre too hard upon her she must have food and sleep and a mouthful of fresh air now and then or she cant stand it i tell you
look at her man
shes worn to a shadow already what are her sufferings to mine said the poor invalid
you dont grudge me these attentions do you helen no arthur if i could really serve you by them
i would give my life to save you if i might would you indeed no most willingly i would ah
thats because you think yourself more fit to die there was a painful pause
he was evidently plunged in gloomy reflections but while i pondered for something to say that might benefit without alarming him hattersley whose mind had been pursuing almost the same course broke silence with i say huntingdon i would send for a parson of some sort if you didnt like the vicar you know you could have his curate or somebody else no none of them can benefit me if she cant was the answer
and the tears gushed from his eyes as he earnestly exclaimed oh helen if i had listened to you it never would have come to this
and if i had heard you long agooh god
how different it would have been hear me now then arthur said i gently pressing his hand
its too late now said he despondingly
and after that another paroxysm of pain came on and then his mind began to wander and we feared his death was approaching but an opiate was administered his sufferings began to abate he gradually became more composed and at length sank into a kind of slumber
he has been quieter since and now hattersley has left him expressing a hope that he shall find him better when he calls tomorrow
perhaps i may recover he replied who knows
this may have been the crisis
what do you think helen unwilling to depress him i gave the most cheering answer i could but still recommended him to prepare for the possibility of what i inly feared was but too certain
but he was determined to hope
shortly after he relapsed into a kind of doze but now he groans again
there is a change
suddenly he called me to his side with such a strange excited manner that i feared he was delirious but he was not
that was the crisis helen said he delightedly
i had an infernal pain hereit is quite gone now
i never was so easy since the fallquite gone by heaven and he clasped and kissed my hand in the very fulness of his heart but finding i did not participate in his joy he quickly flung it from him and bitterly cursed my coldness and insensibility
how could i reply
kneeling beside him i took his hand and fondly pressed it to my lipsfor the first time since our separationand told him as well as tears would let me speak that it was not that that kept me silent it was the fear that this sudden cessation of pain was not so favourable a symptom as he supposed
i immediately sent for the doctor we are now anxiously awaiting him
i will tell you what he says
there is still the same freedom from pain the same deadness to all sensation where the suffering was most acute
my worst fears are realised mortification has commenced
the doctor has told him there is no hope
no words can describe his anguish
i can write no more
the next was still more distressing in the tenor of its contents
the sufferer was fast approaching dissolutiondragged almost to the verge of that awful chasm he trembled to contemplate from which no agony of prayers or tears could save him
nothing could comfort him now hattersleys rough attempts at consolation were utterly in vain
the world was nothing to him life and all its interests its petty cares and transient pleasures were a cruel mockery
to talk of the past was to torture him with vain remorse to refer to the future was to increase his anguish and yet to be silent was to leave him a prey to his own regrets and apprehensions
often he dwelt with shuddering minuteness on the fate of his perishing claythe slow piecemeal dissolution already invading his frame the shroud the coffin the dark lonely grave and all the horrors of corruption
if i try said his afflicted wife to divert him from these thingsto raise his thoughts to higher themes it is no betterworse and worse he groans
if there be really life beyond the tomb and judgment after death how can i face iti cannot do him any good he will neither be enlightened nor roused nor comforted by anything i say and yet he clings to me with unrelenting pertinacitywith a kind of childish desperation as if i could save him from the fate he dreads
he keeps me night and day beside him
he is holding my left hand now while i write he has held it thus for hours sometimes quietly with his pale face upturned to mine sometimes clutching my arm with violencethe big drops starting from his forehead at the thoughts of what he sees or thinks he sees before him
if i withdraw my hand for a moment it distresses him
stay with me helen he says let me hold you so it seems as if harm could not reach me while you are here
but death will comeit is coming nowfast fastandoh if i could believe there was nothing after dont try to believe it arthur there is joy and glory after if you will but try to reach it what for me he said with something like a laugh
are we not to be judged according to the deeds done in the body
wheres the use of a probationary existence if a man may spend it as he pleases just contrary to gods decrees and then go to heaven with the bestif the vilest sinner may win the reward of the holiest saint by merely saying i repent but if you sincerely repent i cant repent i only fear you only regret the past for its consequences to yourself just soexcept that im sorry to have wronged you nell because youre so good to me think of the goodness of god and you cannot but be grieved to have offended him what is godi cannot see him or hear himgod is only an idea god is infinite wisdom and power and goodnessand love but if this idea is too vast for your human facultiesif your mind loses itself in its overwhelming infinitude fix it on him who condescended to take our nature upon him who was raised to heaven even in his glorified human body in whom the fulness of the godhead shines but he only shook his head and sighed
then in another paroxysm of shuddering horror he tightened his grasp on my hand and arm and groaning and lamenting still clung to me with that wild desperate earnestness so harrowing to my soul because i know i cannot help him
i did my best to soothe and comfort him
death is so terrible he cried i cannot bear it
you dont know helenyou cant imagine what it is because you havent it before you
and when im buried youll return to your old ways and be as happy as ever and all the world will go on just as busy and merry as if i had never been while i he burst into tears
you neednt let that distress you i said we shall all follow you soon enough i wish to god i could take you with me now he exclaimed you should plead for me no man can deliver his brother nor make agreement unto god for him i replied it cost more to redeem their soulsit cost the blood of an incarnate god perfect and sinless in himself to redeem us from the bondage of the evil onelet him plead for you but i seem to speak in vain
he does not now as formerly laugh these blessed truths to scorn but still he cannot trust or will not comprehend them
he cannot linger long
he suffers dreadfully and so do those that wait upon him
but i will not harass you with further details i have said enough i think to convince you that i did well to go to him poor poor helen
dreadful indeed her trials must have been
and i could do nothing to lessen themnay it almost seemed as if i had brought them upon her myself by my own secret desires and whether i looked at her husbands sufferings or her own it seemed almost like a judgment upon myself for having cherished such a wish
the next day but one there came another letter
that too was put into my hands without a remark and these are its contents dec th
he is gone at last
i sat beside him all night with my hand fast locked in his watching the changes of his features and listening to his failing breath
he had been silent a long time and i thought he would never speak again when he murmured faintly but distinctlypray for me helen i do pray for you every hour and every minute arthur but you must pray for yourself his lips moved but emitted no soundthen his looks became unsettled and from the incoherent halfuttered words that escaped him from time to time supposing him to be now unconscious i gently disengaged my hand from his intending to steal away for a breath of air for i was almost ready to faint but a convulsive movement of the fingers and a faintly whispered dont leave me immediately recalled me i took his hand again and held it till he was no moreand then i fainted
it was not grief it was exhaustion that till then i had been enabled successfully to combat
oh frederick
none can imagine the miseries bodily and mental of that deathbed
how could i endure to think that that poor trembling soul was hurried away to everlasting torment
it would drive me mad
but thank god i have hopenot only from a vague dependence on the possibility that penitence and pardon might have reached him at the last but from the blessed confidence that through whatever purging fires the erring spirit may be doomed to passwhatever fate awaits itstill it is not lost and god who hateth nothing that he hath made will bless it in the end
his body will be consigned on thursday to that dark grave he so much dreaded but the coffin must be closed as soon as possible
if you will attend the funeral come quickly for i need help
helen huntingdon
on reading this i had no reason to disguise my joy and hope from frederick lawrence for i had none to be ashamed of
i felt no joy but that his sister was at length released from her afflictive overwhelming toilno hope but that she would in time recover from the effects of it and be suffered to rest in peace and quietness at least for the remainder of her life
i experienced a painful commiseration for her unhappy husband though fully aware that he had brought every particle of his sufferings upon himself and but too well deserved them all and a profound sympathy for her own afflictions and deep anxiety for the consequences of those harassing cares those dreadful vigils that incessant and deleterious confinement beside a living corpsefor i was persuaded she had not hinted half the sufferings she had had to endure
you will go to her lawrence said i as i put the letter into his hand
yes immediately thats right
ill leave you then to prepare for your departure ive done that already while you were reading the letter and before you came and the carriage is now coming round to the door inly approving his promptitude i bade him goodmorning and withdrew
he gave me a searching glance as we pressed each others hands at parting but whatever he sought in my countenance he saw there nothing but the most becoming gravityit might be mingled with a little sternness in momentary resentment at what i suspected to be passing in his mind
had i forgotten my own prospects my ardent love my pertinacious hopes
it seemed like sacrilege to revert to them now but i had not forgotten them
it was however with a gloomy sense of the darkness of those prospects the fallacy of those hopes and the vanity of that affection that i reflected on those things as i remounted my horse and slowly journeyed homewards
mrs huntingdon was free now it was no longer a crime to think of herbut did she ever think of me not nowof course it was not to be expectedbut would she when this shock was over
in all the course of her correspondence with her brother our mutual friend as she herself had called him she had never mentioned me but onceand that was from necessity
this alone afforded strong presumption that i was already forgotten yet this was not the worst it might have been her sense of duty that had kept her silent she might be only trying to forget but in addition to this i had a gloomy conviction that the awful realities she had seen and felt her reconciliation with the man she had once loved his dreadful sufferings and death must eventually efface from her mind all traces of her passing love for me
she might recover from these horrors so far as to be restored to her former health her tranquillity her cheerfulness evenbut never to those feelings which would appear to her henceforth as a fleeting fancy a vain illusive dream especially as there was no one to remind her of my existenceno means of assuring her of my fervent constancy now that we were so far apart and delicacy forbade me to see her or to write to her for months to come at least
and how could i engage her brother in my behalf
how could i break that icy crust of shy reserve
perhaps he would disapprove of my attachment now as highly as before perhaps he would think me too poortoo lowly born to match with his sister
yes there was another barrier doubtless there was a wide distinction between the rank and circumstances of mrs huntingdon the lady of grassdale manor and those of mrs graham the artist the tenant of wildfell hall
and it might be deemed presumption in me to offer my hand to the former by the world by her friends if not by herself a penalty i might brave if i were certain she loved me but otherwise how could i
and finally her deceased husband with his usual selfishness might have so constructed his will as to place restrictions upon her marrying again
so that you see i had reasons enough for despair if i chose to indulge it
nevertheless it was with no small degree of impatience that i looked forward to mr lawrences return from grassdale impatience that increased in proportion as his absence was prolonged
he stayed away some ten or twelve days
all very right that he should remain to comfort and help his sister but he might have written to tell me how she was or at least to tell me when to expect his return for he might have known i was suffering tortures of anxiety for her and uncertainty for my own future prospects
and when he did return all he told me about her was that she had been greatly exhausted and worn by her unremitting exertions in behalf of that man who had been the scourge of her life and had dragged her with him nearly to the portals of the grave and was still much shaken and depressed by his melancholy end and the circumstances attendant upon it but no word in reference to me no intimation that my name had ever passed her lips or even been spoken in her presence
to be sure i asked no questions on the subject i could not bring my mind to do so believing as i did that lawrence was indeed averse to the idea of my union with his sister
i saw that he expected to be further questioned concerning his visit and i saw too with the keen perception of awakened jealousy or alarmed selfesteem or by whatever name i ought to call it that he rather shrank from that impending scrutiny and was no less pleased than surprised to find it did not come
of course i was burning with anger but pride obliged me to suppress my feelings and preserve a smooth face or at least a stoic calmness throughout the interview
it was well it did for reviewing the matter in my sober judgment i must say it would have been highly absurd and improper to have quarrelled with him on such an occasion
i must confess too that i wronged him in my heart the truth was he liked me very well but he was fully aware that a union between mrs huntingdon and me would be what the world calls a msalliance and it was not in his nature to set the world at defiance especially in such a case as this for its dread laugh or ill opinion would be far more terrible to him directed against his sister than himself
had he believed that a union was necessary to the happiness of both or of either or had he known how fervently i loved her he would have acted differently but seeing me so calm and cool he would not for the world disturb my philosophy and though refraining entirely from any active opposition to the match he would yet do nothing to bring it about and would much rather take the part of prudence in aiding us to overcome our mutual predilections than that of feeling to encourage them
and he was in the right of it you will say
perhaps he was at any rate i had no business to feel so bitterly against him as i did but i could not then regard the matter in such a moderate light and after a brief conversation upon indifferent topics i went away suffering all the pangs of wounded pride and injured friendship in addition to those resulting from the fear that i was indeed forgotten and the knowledge that she i loved was alone and afflicted suffering from injured health and dejected spirits and i was forbidden to console or assist her forbidden even to assure her of my sympathy for the transmission of any such message through mr lawrence was now completely out of the question
but what should i do
i would wait and see if she would notice me which of course she would not unless by some kind message intrusted to her brother that in all probability he would not deliver and then dreadful thought
she would think me cooled and changed for not returning it or perhaps he had already given her to understand that i had ceased to think of her
i would wait however till the six months after our parting were fairly passed which would be about the close of february and then i would send her a letter modestly reminding her of her former permission to write to her at the close of that period and hoping i might avail myself of itat least to express my heartfelt sorrow for her late afflictions my just appreciation of her generous conduct and my hope that her health was now completely reestablished and that she would some time be permitted to enjoy those blessings of a peaceful happy life which had been denied her so long but which none could more truly be said to merit than herselfadding a few words of kind remembrance to my little friend arthur with a hope that he had not forgotten me and perhaps a few more in reference to bygone times to the delightful hours i had passed in her society and my unfading recollection of them which was the salt and solace of my life and a hope that her recent troubles had not entirely banished me from her mind
if she did not answer this of course i should write no more if she did as surely she would in some fashion my future proceedings should be regulated by her reply
ten weeks was long to wait in such a miserable state of uncertainty but courage
it must be endured
and meantime i would continue to see lawrence now and then though not so often as before and i would still pursue my habitual inquiries after his sister if he had lately heard from her and how she was but nothing more
i did so and the answers i received were always provokingly limited to the letter of the inquiry she was much as usual she made no complaints but the tone of her last letter evinced great depression of mind she said she was better and finally she said she was well and very busy with her sons education and with the management of her late husbands property and the regulation of his affairs
the rascal had never told me how that property was disposed or whether mr huntingdon had died intestate or not and i would sooner die than ask him lest he should misconstrue into covetousness my desire to know
he never offered to show me his sisters letters now and i never hinted a wish to see them
february however was approaching december was past january at length was almost overa few more weeks and then certain despair or renewal of hope would put an end to this long agony of suspense
but alas
it was just about that time she was called to sustain another blow in the death of her unclea worthless old fellow enough in himself i daresay but he had always shown more kindness and affection to her than to any other creature and she had always been accustomed to regard him as a parent
she was with him when he died and had assisted her aunt to nurse him during the last stage of his illness
her brother went to staningley to attend the funeral and told me upon his return that she was still there endeavouring to cheer her aunt with her presence and likely to remain some time
this was bad news for me for while she continued there i could not write to her as i did not know the address and would not ask it of him
but week followed week and every time i inquired about her she was still at staningley
where is staningley i asked at last
in shire was the brief reply and there was something so cold and dry in the manner of it that i was effectually deterred from requesting a more definite account
when will she return to grassdale was my next question
i dont know confound it i muttered
why markham asked my companion with an air of innocent surprise
but i did not deign to answer him save by a look of silent sullen contempt at which he turned away and contemplated the carpet with a slight smile half pensive half amused but quickly looking up he began to talk of other subjects trying to draw me into a cheerful and friendly conversation but i was too much irritated to discourse with him and soon took leave
you see lawrence and i somehow could not manage to get on very well together
the fact is i believe we were both of us a little too touchy
it is a troublesome thing halford this susceptibility to affronts where none are intended
i am no martyr to it now as you can bear me witness i have learned to be merry and wise to be more easy with myself and more indulgent to my neighbours and i can afford to laugh at both lawrence and you
partly from accident partly from wilful negligence on my part for i was really beginning to dislike him several weeks elapsed before i saw my friend again
when we did meet it was he that sought me out
one bright morning early in june he came into the field where i was just commencing my hay harvest
it is long since i saw you markham said he after the first few words had passed between us
do you never mean to come to woodford again i called once and you were out i was sorry but that was long since i hoped you would call again and now i have called and you were out which you generally are or i would do myself the pleasure of calling more frequently but being determined to see you this time i have left my pony in the lane and come over hedge and ditch to join you for i am about to leave woodford for a while and may not have the pleasure of seeing you again for a month or two where are you going to grassdale first said he with a halfsmile he would willingly have suppressed if he could
to grassdale
is she there then yes but in a day or two she will leave it to accompany mrs maxwell to f for the benefit of the sea air and i shall go with them f was at that time a quiet but respectable wateringplace it is considerably more frequented now
lawrence seemed to expect me to take advantage of this circumstance to entrust him with some sort of a message to his sister and i believe he would have undertaken to deliver it without any material objections if i had had the sense to ask him though of course he would not offer to do so if i was content to let it alone
but i could not bring myself to make the request and it was not till after he was gone that i saw how fair an opportunity i had lost and then indeed i deeply regretted my stupidity and my foolish pride but it was now too late to remedy the evil
he did not return till towards the latter end of august
he wrote to me twice or thrice from f but his letters were most provokingly unsatisfactory dealing in generalities or in trifles that i cared nothing about or replete with fancies and reflections equally unwelcome to me at the time saying next to nothing about his sister and little more about himself
i would wait however till he came back perhaps i could get something more out of him then
at all events i would not write to her now while she was with him and her aunt who doubtless would be still more hostile to my presumptuous aspirations than himself
when she was returned to the silence and solitude of her own home it would be my fittest opportunity
when lawrence came however he was as reserved as ever on the subject of my keen anxiety
he told me that his sister had derived considerable benefit from her stay at f that her son was quite well andalas
that both of them were gone with mrs maxwell back to staningley and there they stayed at least three months
but instead of boring you with my chagrin my expectations and disappointments my fluctuations of dull despondency and flickering hope my varying resolutions now to drop it and now to perseverenow to make a bold push and now to let things pass and patiently abide my timei will employ myself in settling the business of one or two of the characters introduced in the course of this narrative whom i may not have occasion to mention again
some time before mr huntingdons death lady lowborough eloped with another gallant to the continent where having lived a while in reckless gaiety and dissipation they quarrelled and parted
she went dashing on for a season but years came and money went she sunk at length in difficulty and debt disgrace and misery and died at last as i have heard in penury neglect and utter wretchedness
but this might be only a report she may be living yet for anything i or any of her relatives or former acquaintances can tell for they have all lost sight of her long years ago and would as thoroughly forget her if they could
her husband however upon this second misdemeanour immediately sought and obtained a divorce and not long after married again
it was well he did for lord lowborough morose and moody as he seemed was not the man for a bachelors life
no public interests no ambitious projects or active pursuitsor ties of friendship even if he had had any friends could compensate to him for the absence of domestic comforts and endearments
he had a son and a nominal daughter it is true but they too painfully reminded him of their mother and the unfortunate little annabella was a source of perpetual bitterness to his soul
he had obliged himself to treat her with paternal kindness he had forced himself not to hate her and even perhaps to feel some degree of kindly regard for her at last in return for her artless and unsuspecting attachment to himself but the bitterness of his selfcondemnation for his inward feelings towards that innocent being his constant struggles to subdue the evil promptings of his nature for it was not a generous one though partly guessed at by those who knew him could be known to god and his own heart aloneso also was the hardness of his conflicts with the temptation to return to the vice of his youth and seek oblivion for past calamities and deadness to the present misery of a blighted heart a joyless friendless life and a morbidly disconsolate mind by yielding again to that insidious foe to health and sense and virtue which had so deplorably enslaved and degraded him before
the second object of his choice was widely different from the first
some wondered at his taste some even ridiculed itbut in this their folly was more apparent than his
the lady was about his own ageie between thirty and fortyremarkable neither for beauty nor wealth nor brilliant accomplishments nor any other thing that i ever heard of except genuine good sense unswerving integrity active piety warmhearted benevolence and a fund of cheerful spirits
these qualities however as you may readily imagine combined to render her an excellent mother to the children and an invaluable wife to his lordship
he with his usual selfdepreciation thought her a world too good for him and while he wondered at the kindness of providence in conferring such a gift upon him and even at her taste in preferring him to other men he did his best to reciprocate the good she did him and so far succeeded that she was and i believe still is one of the happiest and fondest wives in england and all who question the good taste of either partner may be thankful if their respective selections afford them half the genuine satisfaction in the end or repay their preference with affection half as lasting and sincere
if you are at all interested in the fate of that low scoundrel grimsby i can only tell you that he went from bad to worse sinking from bathos to bathos of vice and villainy consorting only with the worst members of his club and the lowest dregs of societyhappily for the rest of the worldand at last met his end in a drunken brawl from the hands it is said of some brother scoundrel he had cheated at play
as for mr hattersley he had never wholly forgotten his resolution to come out from among them and behave like a man and a christian and the last illness and death of his once jolly friend huntingdon so deeply and seriously impressed him with the evil of their former practices that he never needed another lesson of the kind
avoiding the temptations of the town he continued to pass his life in the country immersed in the usual pursuits of a hearty active country gentleman his occupations being those of farming and breeding horses and cattle diversified with a little hunting and shooting and enlivened by the occasional companionship of his friends better friends than those of his youth and the society of his happy little wife now cheerful and confiding as heart could wish and his fine family of stalwart sons and blooming daughters
his father the banker having died some years ago and left him all his riches he has now full scope for the exercise of his prevailing tastes and i need not tell you that ralph hattersley esq is celebrated throughout the country for his noble breed of horses
we will now turn to a certain still cold cloudy afternoon about the commencement of december when the first fall of snow lay thinly scattered over the blighted fields and frozen roads or stored more thickly in the hollows of the deep cartruts and footsteps of men and horses impressed in the now petrified mire of last months drenching rains
i remember it well for i was walking home from the vicarage with no less remarkable a personage than miss eliza millward by my side
i had been to call upon her fathera sacrifice to civility undertaken entirely to please my mother not myself for i hated to go near the house not merely on account of my antipathy to the once so bewitching eliza but because i had not half forgiven the old gentleman himself for his ill opinion of mrs huntingdon for though now constrained to acknowledge himself mistaken in his former judgment he still maintained that she had done wrong to leave her husband it was a violation of her sacred duties as a wife and a tempting of providence by laying herself open to temptation and nothing short of bodily illusage and that of no trifling nature could excuse such a stepnor even that for in such a case she ought to appeal to the laws for protection
but it was not of him i intended to speak it was of his daughter eliza
just as i was taking leave of the vicar she entered the room ready equipped for a walk
i was just coming to see your sister mr markham said she and so if you have no objection ill accompany you home
i like company when im walking outdont you yes when its agreeable that of course rejoined the young lady smiling archly
so we proceeded together
shall i find rose at home do you think said she as we closed the garden gate and set our faces towards lindencar
i believe so i trust i shall for ive a little bit of news for herif you havent forestalled me i yes do you know what mr lawrence is gone for she looked up anxiously for my reply
is he gone said i and her face brightened
ah
then he hasnt told you about his sister what of her i demanded in terror lest some evil should have befallen her
oh mr markham how you blush cried she with a tormenting laugh
ha ha you have not forgotten her yet
but you had better be quick about it i can tell you foralas alasshes going to be married next thursday no miss eliza thats false do you charge me with a falsehood sir you are misinformed am i
do you know better then i think i do what makes you look so pale then said she smiling with delight at my emotion
is it anger at poor me for telling such a fib
well i only tell the tale as twas told to me i dont vouch for the truth of it but at the same time i dont see what reason sarah should have for deceiving me or her informant for deceiving her and that was what she told me the footman told herthat mrs huntingdon was going to be married on thursday and mr lawrence was gone to the wedding
she did tell me the name of the gentleman but ive forgotten that
perhaps you can assist me to remember it
is there not some one that lives nearor frequently visits the neighbourhood that has long been attached to hera mroh dear
mr hargrave suggested i with a bitter smile
youre right cried she that was the very name impossible miss eliza i exclaimed in a tone that made her start
well you know thats what they told me said she composedly staring me in the face
and then she broke out into a long shrill laugh that put me to my wits end with fury
really you must excuse me cried she
i know its very rude but ha ha hadid you think to marry her yourself
dear dear what a pityha ha ha
gracious mr markham are you going to faint
oh mercy
shall i call this man
here jacob but checking the word on her lips i seized her arm and gave it i think a pretty severe squeeze for she shrank into herself with a faint cry of pain or terror but the spirit within her was not subdued instantly rallying she continued with wellfeigned concern what can i do for you
will you have some watersome brandy
i daresay they have some in the publichouse down there if youll let me run have done with this nonsense cried i sternly
she looked confoundedalmost frightened again for a moment
you know i hate such jests i continued
jests indeed
i wasnt jesting you were laughing at all events and i dont like to be laughed at returned i making violent efforts to speak with proper dignity and composure and to say nothing but what was coherent and sensible
and since you are in such a merry mood miss eliza you must be good enough company for yourself and therefore i shall leave you to finish your walk alonefor now i think of it i have business elsewhere so goodevening with that i left her smothering her malicious laughter and turned aside into the fields springing up the bank and pushing through the nearest gap in the hedge
determined at once to prove the truthor rather the falsehoodof her story i hastened to woodford as fast as my legs could carry me first veering round by a circuitous course but the moment i was out of sight of my fair tormentor cutting away across the country just as a bird might fly over pastureland and fallow and stubble and lane clearing hedges and ditches and hurdles till i came to the young squires gates
never till now had i known the full fervour of my lovethe full strength of my hopes not wholly crushed even in my hours of deepest despondency always tenaciously clinging to the thought that one day she might be mine or if not that at least that something of my memory some slight remembrance of our friendship and our love would be for ever cherished in her heart
i marched up to the door determined if i saw the master to question him boldly concerning his sister to wait and hesitate no longer but cast false delicacy and stupid pride behind my back and know my fate at once
is mr lawrence at home i eagerly asked of the servant that opened the door
no sir master went yesterday replied he looking very alert
went where to grassdale sirwasnt you aware sir
hes very close is master said the fellow with a foolish simpering grin
i suppose sir but i turned and left him without waiting to hear what he supposed
i was not going to stand there to expose my tortured feelings to the insolent laughter and impertinent curiosity of a fellow like that
but what was to be done now
could it be possible that she had left me for that man
i could not believe it
me she might forsake but not to give herself to him
well i would know the truth to no concerns of daily life could i attend while this tempest of doubt and dread of jealousy and rage distracted me
i would take the morning coach from l the evening one would be already gone and fly to grassdalei must be there before the marriage
and why
because a thought struck me that perhaps i might prevent itthat if i did not she and i might both lament it to the latest moment of our lives
it struck me that someone might have belied me to her perhaps her brother yes no doubt her brother had persuaded her that i was false and faithless and taking advantage of her natural indignation and perhaps her desponding carelessness about her future life had urged her artfully cruelly on to this other marriage in order to secure her from me
if this was the case and if she should only discover her mistake when too late to repair itto what a life of misery and vain regret might she be doomed as well as me and what remorse for me to think my foolish scruples had induced it all
oh i must see hershe must know my truth even if i told it at the church door
i might pass for a madman or an impertinent fooleven she might be offended at such an interruption or at least might tell me it was now too late
but if i could save her if she might be mineit was too rapturous a thought
winged by this hope and goaded by these fears i hurried homewards to prepare for my departure on the morrow
i told my mother that urgent business which admitted no delay but which i could not then explain called me away
my deep anxiety and serious preoccupation could not be concealed from her maternal eyes and i had much ado to calm her apprehensions of some disastrous mystery
that night there came a heavy fall of snow which so retarded the progress of the coaches on the following day that i was almost driven to distraction
i travelled all night of course for this was wednesday tomorrow morning doubtless the marriage would take place
but the night was long and dark the snow heavily clogged the wheels and balled the horses feet the animals were consumedly lazy the coachman most execrably cautious the passengers confoundedly apathetic in their supine indifference to the rate of our progression
instead of assisting me to bully the several coachmen and urge them forward they merely stared and grinned at my impatience one fellow even ventured to rally me upon itbut i silenced him with a look that quelled him for the rest of the journey and when at the last stage i would have taken the reins into my own hand they all with one accord opposed it
it was broad daylight when we entered m and drew up at the rose and crown i alighted and called aloud for a postchaise to grassdale
there was none to be had the only one in the town was under repair
a gig thena flycaranythingonly be quick there was a gig but not a horse to spare
i sent into the town to seek one but they were such an intolerable time about it that i could wait no longeri thought my own feet could carry me sooner and bidding them send the conveyance after me if it were ready within an hour i set off as fast as i could walk
the distance was little more than six miles but the road was strange and i had to keep stopping to inquire my way hallooing to carters and clodhoppers and frequently invading the cottages for there were few abroad that winters morning sometimes knocking up the lazy people from their beds for where so little work was to be done perhaps so little food and fire to be had they cared not to curtail their slumbers
i had no time to think of them however aching with weariness and desperation i hurried on
the gig did not overtake me and it was well i had not waited for it vexatious rather that i had been fool enough to wait so long
at length however i entered the neighbourhood of grassdale
i approached the little rural churchbut lo
there stood a train of carriages before it it needed not the white favours bedecking the servants and horses nor the merry voices of the village idlers assembled to witness the show to apprise me that there was a wedding within
i ran in among them demanding with breathless eagerness had the ceremony long commenced
they only gaped and stared
in my desperation i pushed past them and was about to enter the churchyard gate when a group of ragged urchins that had been hanging like bees to the window suddenly dropped off and made a rush for the porch vociferating in the uncouth dialect of their country something which signified its overtheyre coming out if eliza millward had seen me then she might indeed have been delighted
i grasped the gatepost for support and stood intently gazing towards the door to take my last look on my souls delight my first on that detested mortal who had torn her from my heart and doomed her i was certain to a life of misery and hollow vain repiningfor what happiness could she enjoy with him
i did not wish to shock her with my presence now but i had not power to move away
forth came the bride and bridegroom
him i saw not i had eyes for none but her
a long veil shrouded half her graceful form but did not hide it i could see that while she carried her head erect her eyes were bent upon the ground and her face and neck were suffused with a crimson blush but every feature was radiant with smiles and gleaming through the misty whiteness of her veil were clusters of golden ringlets
oh heavens
it was not my helen
the first glimpse made me startbut my eyes were darkened with exhaustion and despair
dare i trust them
yesit is not she
it was a younger slighter rosier beautylovely indeed but with far less dignity and depth of soulwithout that indefinable grace that keenly spiritual yet gentle charm that ineffable power to attract and subjugate the heartmy heart at least
i looked at the bridegroomit was frederick lawrence
i wiped away the cold drops that were trickling down my forehead and stepped back as he approached but his eyes fell upon me and he knew me altered as my appearance must have been
is that you markham said he startled and confounded at the apparitionperhaps too at the wildness of my looks
yes lawrence is that you i mustered the presence of mind to reply
he smiled and coloured as if halfproud and halfashamed of his identity and if he had reason to be proud of the sweet lady on his arm he had no less cause to be ashamed of having concealed his good fortune so long
allow me to introduce you to my bride said he endeavouring to hide his embarrassment by an assumption of careless gaiety
esther this is mr markham my friend markham mrs lawrence late miss hargrave i bowed to the bride and vehemently wrung the bridegrooms hand
why did you not tell me of this i said reproachfully pretending a resentment i did not feel for in truth i was almost wild with joy to find myself so happily mistaken and overflowing with affection to him for this and for the base injustice i felt that i had done him in my mindhe might have wronged me but not to that extent and as i had hated him like a demon for the last forty hours the reaction from such a feeling was so great that i could pardon all offences for the momentand love him in spite of them too
i did tell you said he with an air of guilty confusion you received my letter what letter the one announcing my intended marriage i never received the most distant hint of such an intention it must have crossed you on your way thenit should have reached you yesterday morningit was rather late i acknowledge
but what brought you here then if you received no information it was now my turn to be confounded but the young lady who had been busily patting the snow with her foot during our short sottovoce colloquy very opportunely came to my assistance by pinching her companions arm and whispering a suggestion that his friend should be invited to step into the carriage and go with them it being scarcely agreeable to stand there among so many gazers and keeping their friends waiting into the bargain
and so cold as it is too said he glancing with dismay at her slight drapery and immediately handing her into the carriage
markham will you come
we are going to paris but we can drop you anywhere between this and dover no thank you
goodbyi neednt wish you a pleasant journey but i shall expect a very handsome apology some time mind and scores of letters before we meet again he shook my hand and hastened to take his place beside his lady
this was no time or place for explanation or discourse we had already stood long enough to excite the wonder of the village sightseers and perhaps the wrath of the attendant bridal party though of course all this passed in a much shorter time than i have taken to relate or even than you will take to read it
i stood beside the carriage and the window being down i saw my happy friend fondly encircle his companions waist with his arm while she rested her glowing cheek on his shoulder looking the very impersonation of loving trusting bliss
in the interval between the footmans closing the door and taking his place behind she raised her smiling brown eyes to his face observing playfullyi fear you must think me very insensible frederick i know it is the custom for ladies to cry on these occasions but i couldnt squeeze a tear for my life he only answered with a kiss and pressed her still closer to his bosom
but what is this he murmured
why esther youre crying now oh its nothingits only too much happinessand the wish sobbed she that our dear helen were as happy as ourselves bless you for that wish i inwardly responded as the carriage rolled awayand heaven grant it be not wholly vain i thought a cloud had suddenly darkened her husbands face as she spoke
what did he think
could he grudge such happiness to his dear sister and his friend as he now felt himself
at such a moment it was impossible
the contrast between her fate and his must darken his bliss for a time
perhaps too he thought of me perhaps he regretted the part he had had in preventing our union by omitting to help us if not by actually plotting against us
i exonerated him from that charge now and deeply lamented my former ungenerous suspicions but he had wronged us stilli hoped i trusted that he had
he had not attempted to check the course of our love by actually damming up the streams in their passage but he had passively watched the two currents wandering through lifes arid wilderness declining to clear away the obstructions that divided them and secretly hoping that both would lose themselves in the sand before they could be joined in one
and meantime he had been quietly proceeding with his own affairs perhaps his heart and head had been so full of his fair lady that he had had but little thought to spare for others
doubtless he had made his first acquaintance with herhis first intimate acquaintance at leastduring his three months sojourn at f for i now recollected that he had once casually let fall an intimation that his aunt and sister had a young friend staying with them at the time and this accounted for at least onehalf his silence about all transactions there
now too i saw a reason for many little things that had slightly puzzled me before among the rest for sundry departures from woodford and absences more or less prolonged for which he never satisfactorily accounted and concerning which he hated to be questioned on his return
well might the servant say his master was very close but why this strange reserve to me partly from that remarkable idiosyncrasy to which i have before alluded partly perhaps from tenderness to my feelings or fear to disturb my philosophy by touching upon the infectious theme of love
the tardy gig had overtaken me at last
i entered it and bade the man who brought it drive to grassdale manori was too busy with my own thoughts to care to drive it myself
i would see mrs huntingdonthere could be no impropriety in that now that her husband had been dead above a yearand by her indifference or her joy at my unexpected arrival i could soon tell whether her heart was truly mine
but my companion a loquacious forward fellow was not disposed to leave me to the indulgence of my private cogitations
there they go said he as the carriages filed away before us
therell be brave doings on yonder today as what come tomorraknow anything of that family sir
or youre a stranger in these parts i know them by report humph
theres the best of em gone anyhow
and i suppose the old missis is agoing to leave after this stirs gotten overed and take herself off somewhere to live on her bit of a jointure and the young unat least the new un shes none so very youngis coming down to live at the grove is mr hargrave married then ay sir a few months since
he should a been wed afore to a widow lady but they couldnt agree over the money shed a rare long purse and mr hargrave wanted it all to hisself but she wouldnt let it go and so then they fell out
this one isnt quite as rich nor as handsome either but she hasnt been married before
shes very plain they say and getting on to forty or past and so you know if she didnt jump at this hopportunity she thought shed never get a better
i guess she thought such a handsome young husband was worth all at ever she had and he might take it and welcome but i lay shell rue her bargain afore long
they say she begins already to see at he isnt not altogether that nice generous perlite delightful gentleman at she thought him afore marriagehe begins a being careless and masterful already
ay and shell find him harder and carelesser nor she thinks on you seem to be well acquainted with him i observed
i am sir ive known him since he was quite a young gentleman and a proud un he was and a wilful
i was servant yonder for several years but i couldnt stand their niggardly waysshe got ever longer and worse did missis with her nipping and screwing and watching and grudging so i thought id find another place are we not near the house said i interrupting him
yes sir yonds the park my heart sank within me to behold that stately mansion in the midst of its expansive grounds
the park as beautiful now in its wintry garb as it could be in its summer glory the majestic sweep the undulating swell and fall displayed to full advantage in that robe of dazzling purity stainless and printlesssave one long winding track left by the trooping deerthe stately timbertrees with their heavyladen branches gleaming white against the dull grey sky the deep encircling woods the broad expanse of water sleeping in frozen quiet and the weeping ash and willow drooping their snowclad boughs above itall presented a picture striking indeed and pleasing to an unencumbered mind but by no means encouraging to me
there was one comfort howeverall this was entailed upon little arthur and could not under any circumstances strictly speaking be his mothers
but how was she situated
overcoming with a sudden effort my repugnance to mention her name to my garrulous companion i asked him if he knew whether her late husband had left a will and how the property had been disposed of
oh yes he knew all about it and i was quickly informed that to her had been left the full control and management of the estate during her sons minority besides the absolute unconditional possession of her own fortune but i knew that her father had not given her much and the small additional sum that had been settled upon her before marriage
before the close of the explanation we drew up at the parkgates
now for the trial
if i should find her withinbut alas
she might be still at staningley her brother had given me no intimation to the contrary
i inquired at the porters lodge if mrs huntingdon were at home
no she was with her aunt in shire but was expected to return before christmas
she usually spent most of her time at staningley only coming to grassdale occasionally when the management of affairs or the interest of her tenants and dependents required her presence
near what town is staningley situated i asked
the requisite information was soon obtained
now then my man give me the reins and well return to m
i must have some breakfast at the rose and crown and then away to staningley by the first coach for at m i had time before the coach started to replenish my forces with a hearty breakfast and to obtain the refreshment of my usual mornings ablutions and the amelioration of some slight change in my toilet and also to despatch a short note to my mother excellent son that i was to assure her that i was still in existence and to excuse my nonappearance at the expected time
it was a long journey to staningley for those slowtravelling days but i did not deny myself needful refreshment on the road nor even a nights rest at a wayside inn choosing rather to brook a little delay than to present myself worn wild and weatherbeaten before my mistress and her aunt who would be astonished enough to see me without that
next morning therefore i not only fortified myself with as substantial a breakfast as my excited feelings would allow me to swallow but i bestowed a little more than usual time and care upon my toilet and furnished with a change of linen from my small carpetbag wellbrushed clothes wellpolished boots and neat new gloves i mounted the lightning and resumed my journey
i had nearly two stages yet before me but the coach i was informed passed through the neighbourhood of staningley and having desired to be set down as near the hall as possible i had nothing to do but to sit with folded arms and speculate upon the coming hour
it was a clear frosty morning
the very fact of sitting exalted aloft surveying the snowy landscape and sweet sunny sky inhaling the pure bracing air and crunching away over the crisp frozen snow was exhilarating enough in itself but add to this the idea of to what goal i was hastening and whom i expected to meet and you may have some faint conception of my frame of mind at the timeonly a faint one though for my heart swelled with unspeakable delight and my spirits rose almost to madness in spite of my prudent endeavours to bind them down to a reasonable platitude by thinking of the undeniable difference between helens rank and mine of all that she had passed through since our parting of her long unbroken silence and above all of her cool cautious aunt whose counsels she would doubtless be careful not to slight again
these considerations made my heart flutter with anxiety and my chest heave with impatience to get the crisis over but they could not dim her image in my mind or mar the vivid recollection of what had been said and felt between us or destroy the keen anticipation of what was to be in fact i could not realise their terrors now
towards the close of the journey however a couple of my fellowpassengers kindly came to my assistance and brought me low enough
fine land this said one of them pointing with his umbrella to the wide fields on the right conspicuous for their compact hedgerows deep wellcut ditches and fine timbertrees growing sometimes on the borders sometimes in the midst of the enclosure very fine land if you saw it in the summer or spring ay responded the other a gruff elderly man with a drab greatcoat buttoned up to the chin and a cotton umbrella between his knees
its old maxwells i suppose it was his sir but hes dead now youre aware and has left it all to his niece all every rood of it and the mansionhouse and all
every hatom of his worldly goods except just a trifle by way of remembrance to his nephew down in shire and an annuity to his wife its strange sir it is sir and she wasnt his own niece neither
but he had no near relations of his ownnone but a nephew hed quarrelled with and he always had a partiality for this one
and then his wife advised him to it they say shed brought most of the property and it was her wish that this lady should have it humph
shell be a fine catch for somebody she will so
shes a widow but quite young yet and uncommon handsome a fortune of her own besides and only one child and shes nursing a fine estate for him in
therell be lots to speak for her
fraid theres no chance for uzfacetiously jogging me with his elbow as well as his companionha ha ha
no offence sir i hopeto me
ahem
i should think shell marry none but a nobleman myself
look ye sir resumed he turning to his other neighbour and pointing past me with his umbrella thats the hall grand park you see and all them woodsplenty of timber there and lots of game
hallo
what now this exclamation was occasioned by the sudden stoppage of the coach at the parkgates
genleman for staningley hall cried the coachman and i rose and threw my carpetbag on to the ground preparatory to dropping myself down after it
sickly sir asked my talkative neighbour staring me in the face
i daresay it was white enough
no
here coachman thankee sirall right the coachman pocketed his fee and drove away leaving me not walking up the park but pacing to and fro before its gates with folded arms and eyes fixed upon the ground an overwhelming force of images thoughts impressions crowding on my mind and nothing tangibly distinct but this my love had been cherished in vainmy hope was gone for ever i must tear myself away at once and banish or suppress all thoughts of her like the remembrance of a wild mad dream
gladly would i have lingered round the place for hours in the hope of catching at least one distant glimpse of her before i went but it must not bei must not suffer her to see me for what could have brought me hither but the hope of reviving her attachment with a view hereafter to obtain her hand
and could i bear that she should think me capable of such a thingof presuming upon the acquaintancethe love if you willaccidentally contracted or rather forced upon her against her will when she was an unknown fugitive toiling for her own support apparently without fortune family or connections to come upon her now when she was reinstated in her proper sphere and claim a share in her prosperity which had it never failed her would most certainly have kept her unknown to me for ever
and this too when we had parted sixteen months ago and she had expressly forbidden me to hope for a reunion in this world and never sent me a line or a message from that day to this
no
the very idea was intolerable
and even if she should have a lingering affection for me still ought i to disturb her peace by awakening those feelings
to subject her to the struggles of conflicting duty and inclinationto whichsoever side the latter might allure or the former imperatively call herwhether she should deem it her duty to risk the slights and censures of the world the sorrow and displeasure of those she loved for a romantic idea of truth and constancy to me or to sacrifice her individual wishes to the feelings of her friends and her own sense of prudence and the fitness of things
noand i would not
i would go at once and she should never know that i had approached the place of her abode for though i might disclaim all idea of ever aspiring to her hand or even of soliciting a place in her friendly regard her peace should not be broken by my presence nor her heart afflicted by the sight of my fidelity
adieu then dear helen forever
forever adieu so said iand yet i could not tear myself away
i moved a few paces and then looked back for one last view of her stately home that i might have its outward form at least impressed upon my mind as indelibly as her own image which alas
i must not see againthen walked a few steps further and then lost in melancholy musings paused again and leant my back against a rough old tree that grew beside the road
while standing thus absorbed in my gloomy reverie a gentlemans carriage came round the corner of the road
i did not look at it and had it rolled quietly by me i should not have remembered the fact of its appearance at all but a tiny voice from within it roused me by exclaiming mamma mamma heres mr markham i did not hear the reply but presently the same voice answered it is indeed mammalook for yourself i did not raise my eyes but i suppose mamma looked for a clear melodious voice whose tones thrilled through my nerves exclaimed oh aunt
heres mr markham arthurs friend
stop richard there was such evidence of joyous though suppressed excitement in the utterance of those few wordsespecially that tremulous oh auntthat it threw me almost off my guard
the carriage stopped immediately and i looked up and met the eye of a pale grave elderly lady surveying me from the open window
she bowed and so did i and then she withdrew her head while arthur screamed to the footman to let him out but before that functionary could descend from his box a hand was silently put forth from the carriage window
i knew that hand though a black glove concealed its delicate whiteness and half its fair proportions and quickly seizing it i pressed it in my ownardently for a moment but instantly recollecting myself i dropped it and it was immediately withdrawn
were you coming to see us or only passing by asked the low voice of its owner who i felt was attentively surveying my countenance from behind the thick black veil which with the shadowing panels entirely concealed her own from me
ii came to see the place faltered i
the place repeated she in a tone which betokened more displeasure or disappointment than surprise
will you not enter it then if you wish it can you doubt yes yes
he must enter cried arthur running round from the other door and seizing my hand in both his he shook it heartily
do you remember me sir said he
yes full well my little man altered though you are replied i surveying the comparatively tall slim young gentleman with his mothers image visibly stamped upon his fair intelligent features in spite of the blue eyes beaming with gladness and the bright locks clustering beneath his cap
am i not grown said he stretching himself up to his full height
grown
three inches upon my word i was seven last birthday was the proud rejoinder
in seven years more i shall be as tall as you nearly arthur said his mother tell him to come in
go on richard there was a touch of sadness as well as coldness in her voice but i knew not to what to ascribe it
the carriage drove on and entered the gates before us
my little companion led me up the park discoursing merrily all the way
arrived at the halldoor i paused on the steps and looked round me waiting to recover my composure if possibleor at any rate to remember my newformed resolutions and the principles on which they were founded and it was not till arthur had been for some time gently pulling my coat and repeating his invitations to enter that i at length consented to accompany him into the apartment where the ladies awaited us
helen eyed me as i entered with a kind of gentle serious scrutiny and politely asked after mrs markham and rose
i respectfully answered her inquiries
mrs maxwell begged me to be seated observing it was rather cold but she supposed i had not travelled far that morning
not quite twenty miles i answered
not on foot no madam by coach heres rachel sir said arthur the only truly happy one amongst us directing my attention to that worthy individual who had just entered to take her mistresss things
she vouchsafed me an almost friendly smile of recognitiona favour that demanded at least a civil salutation on my part which was accordingly given and respectfully returnedshe had seen the error of her former estimation of my character
when helen was divested of her lugubrious bonnet and veil her heavy winter cloak c she looked so like herself that i knew not how to bear it
i was particularly glad to see her beautiful black hair unstinted still and unconcealed in its glossy luxuriance
mamma has left off her widows cap in honour of uncles marriage observed arthur reading my looks with a childs mingled simplicity and quickness of observation
mamma looked grave and mrs maxwell shook her head
and aunt maxwell is never going to leave off hers persisted the naughty boy but when he saw that his pertness was seriously displeasing and painful to his aunt he went and silently put his arm round her neck kissed her cheek and withdrew to the recess of one of the great baywindows where he quietly amused himself with his dog while mrs maxwell gravely discussed with me the interesting topics of the weather the season and the roads
i considered her presence very useful as a check upon my natural impulsesan antidote to those emotions of tumultuous excitement which would otherwise have carried me away against my reason and my will but just then i felt the restraint almost intolerable and i had the greatest difficulty in forcing myself to attend to her remarks and answer them with ordinary politeness for i was sensible that helen was standing within a few feet of me beside the fire
i dared not look at her but i felt her eye was upon me and from one hasty furtive glance i thought her cheek was slightly flushed and that her fingers as she played with her watchchain were agitated with that restless trembling motion which betokens high excitement
tell me said she availing herself of the first pause in the attempted conversation between her aunt and me and speaking fast and low with her eyes bent on the gold chainfor i now ventured another glancetell me how you all are at lindenhopehas nothing happened since i left you i believe not nobody dead
nobody married no oror expecting to marryno old ties dissolved or new ones formed
no old friends forgotten or supplanted she dropped her voice so low in the last sentence that no one could have caught the concluding words but myself and at the same time turned her eyes upon me with a dawning smile most sweetly melancholy and a look of timid though keen inquiry that made my cheeks tingle with inexpressible emotions
i believe not i answered
certainly not if others are as little changed as i her face glowed in sympathy with mine
and you really did not mean to call she exclaimed
i feared to intrude to intrude cried she with an impatient gesture
what but as if suddenly recollecting her aunts presence she checked herself and turning to that lady continuedwhy aunt this man is my brothers close friend and was my own intimate acquaintance for a few short months at least and professed a great attachment to my boyand when he passes the house so many scores of miles from his home he declines to look in for fear of intruding mr
markham is overmodest observed mrs maxwell
overceremonious rather said her nieceoverwell its no matter and turning from me she seated herself in a chair beside the table and pulling a book to her by the cover began to turn over the leaves in an energetic kind of abstraction
if i had known said i that you would have honoured me by remembering me as an intimate acquaintance i most likely should not have denied myself the pleasure of calling upon you but i thought you had forgotten me long ago you judged of others by yourself muttered she without raising her eyes from the book but reddening as she spoke and hastily turning over a dozen leaves at once
there was a pause of which arthur thought he might venture to avail himself to introduce his handsome young setter and show me how wonderfully it was grown and improved and to ask after the welfare of its father sancho
mrs maxwell then withdrew to take off her things
helen immediately pushed the book from her and after silently surveying her son his friend and his dog for a few moments she dismissed the former from the room under pretence of wishing him to fetch his last new book to show me
the child obeyed with alacrity but i continued caressing the dog
the silence might have lasted till its masters return had it depended on me to break it but in half a minute or less my hostess impatiently rose and taking her former station on the rug between me and the chimney corner earnestly exclaimed gilbert what is the matter with youwhy are you so changed
it is a very indiscreet question i know she hastened to add perhaps a very rude onedont answer it if you think sobut i hate mysteries and concealments i am not changed helenunfortunately i am as keen and passionate as everit is not i it is circumstances that are changed what circumstances
do tell me her cheek was blanched with the very anguish of anxietycould it be with the fear that i had rashly pledged my faith to another
ill tell you at once said i
i will confess that i came here for the purpose of seeing you not without some monitory misgivings at my own presumption and fears that i should be as little welcome as expected when i came but i did not know that this estate was yours until enlightened on the subject of your inheritance by the conversation of two fellowpassengers in the last stage of my journey and then i saw at once the folly of the hopes i had cherished and the madness of retaining them a moment longer and though i alighted at your gates i determined not to enter within them i lingered a few minutes to see the place but was fully resolved to return to m without seeing its mistress and if my aunt and i had not been just returning from our morning drive i should have seen and heard no more of you i thought it would be better for both that we should not meet replied i as calmly as i could but not daring to speak above my breath from conscious inability to steady my voice and not daring to look in her face lest my firmness should forsake me altogether
i thought an interview would only disturb your peace and madden me
but i am glad now of this opportunity of seeing you once more and knowing that you have not forgotten me and of assuring you that i shall never cease to remember you there was a moments pause
mrs huntingdon moved away and stood in the recess of the window
did she regard this as an intimation that modesty alone prevented me from asking her hand
and was she considering how to repulse me with the smallest injury to my feelings
before i could speak to relieve her from such a perplexity she broke the silence herself by suddenly turning towards me and observing you might have had such an opportunity beforeas far i mean as regards assuring me of your kindly recollections and yourself of mine if you had written to me i would have done so but i did not know your address and did not like to ask your brother because i thought he would object to my writing but this would not have deterred me for a moment if i could have ventured to believe that you expected to hear from me or even wasted a thought upon your unhappy friend but your silence naturally led me to conclude myself forgotten did you expect me to write to you then no helenmrs
huntingdon said i blushing at the implied imputation certainly not but if you had sent me a message through your brother or even asked him about me now and then i did ask about you frequently
i was not going to do more continued she smiling so long as you continued to restrict yourself to a few polite inquiries about my health your brother never told me that you had mentioned my name did you ever ask him no for i saw he did not wish to be questioned about you or to afford the slightest encouragement or assistance to my too obstinate attachment helen did not reply
and he was perfectly right added i
but she remained in silence looking out upon the snowy lawn
oh i will relieve her of my presence thought i and immediately i rose and advanced to take leave with a most heroic resolutionbut pride was at the bottom of it or it could not have carried me through
are you going already said she taking the hand i offered and not immediately letting it go
why should i stay any longer wait till arthur comes at least only too glad to obey i stood and leant against the opposite side of the window
you told me you were not changed said my companion you arevery much so no mrs huntingdon i only ought to be do you mean to maintain that you have the same regard for me that you had when last we met i have but it would be wrong to talk of it now it was wrong to talk of it then gilbert it would not nowunless to do so would be to violate the truth i was too much agitated to speak but without waiting for an answer she turned away her glistening eye and crimson cheek and threw up the window and looked out whether to calm her own excited feelings or to relieve her embarrassment or only to pluck that beautiful halfblown christmasrose that grew upon the little shrub without just peeping from the snow that had hitherto no doubt defended it from the frost and was now melting away in the sun
pluck it however she did and having gently dashed the glittering powder from its leaves approached it to her lips and said this rose is not so fragrant as a summer flower but it has stood through hardships none of them could bear the cold rain of winter has sufficed to nourish it and its faint sun to warm it the bleak winds have not blanched it or broken its stem and the keen frost has not blighted it
look gilbert it is still fresh and blooming as a flower can be with the cold snow even now on its petalswill you have it i held out my hand i dared not speak lest my emotion should overmaster me
she laid the rose across my palm but i scarcely closed my fingers upon it so deeply was i absorbed in thinking what might be the meaning of her words and what i ought to do or say upon the occasion whether to give way to my feelings or restrain them still
misconstruing this hesitation into indifferenceor reluctance evento accept her gift helen suddenly snatched it from my hand threw it out on to the snow shut down the window with an emphasis and withdrew to the fire
helen what means this i cried electrified at this startling change in her demeanour
you did not understand my gift said sheor what is worse you despised it
im sorry i gave it you but since i did make such a mistake the only remedy i could think of was to take it away you misunderstood me cruelly i replied and in a minute i had opened the window again leaped out picked up the flower brought it in and presented it to her imploring her to give it me again and i would keep it for ever for her sake and prize it more highly than anything in the world i possessed
and will this content you said she as she took it in her hand
it shall i answered
there then take it i pressed it earnestly to my lips and put it in my bosom mrs huntingdon looking on with a halfsarcastic smile
now are you going said she
i will ifif i must you are changed persisted sheyou are grown either very proud or very indifferent i am neither helenmrs
huntingdon
if you could see my heart you must be oneif not both
and why mrs huntingdonwhy not helen as before helen thendear helen i murmured
i was in an agony of mingled love hope delight uncertainty and suspense
the rose i gave you was an emblem of my heart said she would you take it away and leave me here alone would you give me your hand too if i asked it have i not said enough she answered with a most enchanting smile
i snatched her hand and would have fervently kissed it but suddenly checked myself and said but have you considered the consequences hardly i think or i should not have offered myself to one too proud to take me or too indifferent to make his affection outweigh my worldly goods stupid blockhead that i wasi trembled to clasp her in my arms but dared not believe in so much joy and yet restrained myself to say but if you should repent it would be your fault she replied i never shall unless you bitterly disappoint me
if you have not sufficient confidence in my affection to believe this let me alone my darling angelmy own helen cried i now passionately kissing the hand i still retained and throwing my left arm around her you never shall repent if it depend on me alone
but have you thought of your aunt i trembled for the answer and clasped her closer to my heart in the instinctive dread of losing my newfound treasure
my aunt must not know of it yet said she
she would think it a rash wild step because she could not imagine how well i know you but she must know you herself and learn to like you
you must leave us now after lunch and come again in spring and make a longer stay and cultivate her acquaintance and i know you will like each other and then you will be mine said i printing a kiss upon her lips and another and another for i was as daring and impetuous now as i had been backward and constrained before
noin another year replied she gently disengaging herself from my embrace but still fondly clasping my hand
another year
oh helen i could not wait so long where is your fidelity i mean i could not endure the misery of so long a separation it would not be a separation we will write every day my spirit shall be always with you and sometimes you shall see me with your bodily eye
i will not be such a hypocrite as to pretend that i desire to wait so long myself but as my marriage is to please myself alone i ought to consult my friends about the time of it your friends will disapprove they will not greatly disapprove dear gilbert said she earnestly kissing my hand they cannot when they know you or if they could they would not be true friendsi should not care for their estrangement
now are you satisfied she looked up in my face with a smile of ineffable tenderness
can i be otherwise with your love
and you do love me helen said i not doubting the fact but wishing to hear it confirmed by her own acknowledgment
if you loved as i do she earnestly replied you would not have so nearly lost methese scruples of false delicacy and pride would never thus have troubled youyou would have seen that the greatest worldly distinctions and discrepancies of rank birth and fortune are as dust in the balance compared with the unity of accordant thoughts and feelings and truly loving sympathising hearts and souls but this is too much happiness said i embracing her again i have not deserved it heleni dare not believe in such felicity and the longer i have to wait the greater will be my dread that something will intervene to snatch you from meand think a thousand things may happen in a yeari shall be in one long fever of restless terror and impatience all the time
and besides winter is such a dreary season i thought so too replied she gravely i would not be married in winterin december at least she added with a shudderfor in that month had occurred both the illstarred marriage that had bound her to her former husband and the terrible death that released herand therefore i said another year in spring next spring no nonext autumn perhaps summer then well the close of summer
there now
be satisfied while she was speaking arthur reentered the roomgood boy for keeping out so long
mamma i couldnt find the book in either of the places you told me to look for it there was a conscious something in mammas smile that seemed to say no dear i knew you could not but rachel got it for me at last
look mr markham a natural history with all kinds of birds and beasts in it and the reading as nice as the pictures in great good humour i sat down to examine the book and drew the little fellow between my knees
had he come a minute before i should have received him less graciously but now i affectionately stroked his curling locks and even kissed his ivory forehead he was my own helens son and therefore mine and as such i have ever since regarded him
that pretty child is now a fine young man he has realised his mothers brightest expectations and is at present residing in grassdale manor with his young wifethe merry little helen hattersley of yore
i had not looked through half the book before mrs maxwell appeared to invite me into the other room to lunch
that ladys cool distant manners rather chilled me at first but i did my best to propitiate her and not entirely without success i think even in that first short visit for when i talked cheerfully to her she gradually became more kind and cordial and when i departed she bade me a gracious adieu hoping ere long to have the pleasure of seeing me again
but you must not go till you have seen the conservatory my aunts winter garden said helen as i advanced to take leave of her with as much philosophy and selfcommand as i could summon to my aid
i gladly availed myself of such a respite and followed her into a large and beautiful conservatory plentifully furnished with flowers considering the seasonbut of course i had little attention to spare for them
it was not however for any tender colloquy that my companion had brought me there my aunt is particularly fond of flowers she observed and she is fond of staningley too i brought you here to offer a petition in her behalf that this may be her home as long as she lives andif it be not our home likewisethat i may often see her and be with her for i fear she will be sorry to lose me and though she leads a retired and contemplative life she is apt to get lowspirited if left too much alone by all means dearest helendo what you will with your own
i should not dream of wishing your aunt to leave the place under any circumstances and we will live either here or elsewhere as you and she may determine and you shall see her as often as you like
i know she must be pained to part with you and i am willing to make any reparation in my power
i love her for your sake and her happiness shall be as dear to me as that of my own mother thank you darling
you shall have a kiss for that
goodby
there nowthere gilbertlet me goheres arthur dont astonish his infantile brain with your madness but it is time to bring my narrative to a close
any one but you would say i had made it too long already
but for your satisfaction i will add a few words more because i know you will have a fellowfeeling for the old lady and will wish to know the last of her history
i did come again in spring and agreeably to helens injunctions did my best to cultivate her acquaintance
she received me very kindly having been doubtless already prepared to think highly of my character by her nieces too favourable report
i turned my best side out of course and we got along marvellously well together
when my ambitious intentions were made known to her she took it more sensibly than i had ventured to hope
her only remark on the subject in my hearing was and so mr markham you are going to rob me of my niece i understand
well
i hope god will prosper your union and make my dear girl happy at last
could she have been contented to remain single i own i should have been better satisfied but if she must marry again i know of no one now living and of a suitable age to whom i would more willingly resign her than yourself or who would be more likely to appreciate her worth and make her truly happy as far as i can tell of course i was delighted with the compliment and hoped to show her that she was not mistaken in her favourable judgment
i have however one request to offer continued she
it seems i am still to look on staningley as my home i wish you to make it yours likewise for helen is attached to the place and to meas i am to her
there are painful associations connected with grassdale which she cannot easily overcome and i shall not molest you with my company or interference here i am a very quiet person and shall keep my own apartments and attend to my own concerns and only see you now and then of course i most readily consented to this and we lived in the greatest harmony with our dear aunt until the day of her death which melancholy event took place a few years aftermelancholy not to herself for it came quietly upon her and she was glad to reach her journeys end but only to the few loving friends and grateful dependents she left behind
to return however to my own affairs i was married in summer on a glorious august morning
it took the whole eight months and all helens kindness and goodness to boot to overcome my mothers prejudices against my brideelect and to reconcile her to the idea of my leaving linden grange and living so far away
yet she was gratified at her sons good fortune after all and proudly attributed it all to his own superior merits and endowments
i bequeathed the farm to fergus with better hopes of its prosperity than i should have had a year ago under similar circumstances for he had lately fallen in love with the vicar of ls eldest daughtera lady whose superiority had roused his latent virtues and stimulated him to the most surprising exertions not only to gain her affection and esteem and to obtain a fortune sufficient to aspire to her hand but to render himself worthy of her in his own eyes as well as in those of her parents and in the end he was successful as you already know
as for myself i need not tell you how happily my helen and i have lived together and how blessed we still are in each others society and in the promising young scions that are growing up about us
we are just now looking forward to the advent of you and rose for the time of your annual visit draws nigh when you must leave your dusty smoky noisy toiling striving city for a season of invigorating relaxation and social retirement with us
till then farewell gilbert markham
