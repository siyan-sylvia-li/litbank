stone gate worcester  massachusetts  december 
dear judy  your letter is here
i have read it twice and with amazement
do i understand that jervis has given you for a christmas present the making over of the john grier home into a model institution and that you have chosen me to disburse the money
mei sallie mcbride the head of an orphan asylum
my poor people have you lost your senses or have you become addicted to the use of opium and is this the raving of two fevered imaginations
i am exactly as well fitted to take care of one hundred children as to become the curator of a zoo
and you offer as bait an interesting scotch doctor
my dear judylikewise my dear jervisi see through you
i know exactly the kind of family conference that has been held about the pendleton fireside
isn't it a pity that sallie hasn't amounted to more since she left college
she ought to be doing something useful instead of frittering her time away in the petty social life of worcester
also jervis speaks she is getting interested in that confounded young hallock too goodlooking and fascinating and erratic i never did like politicians
we must deflect her mind with some uplifting and absorbing occupation until the danger is past
ha
i have it
we will put her in charge of the john grier home
oh i can hear him as clearly as if i were there
on the occasion of my last visit in your delectable household jervis and i had a very solemn conversation in regard to  marriage  the low ideals of politicians  the frivolous useless lives that society women lead
please tell your moral husband that i took his words deeply to heart and that ever since my return to worcester i have been spending one afternoon a week reading poetry with the inmates of the female inebriate asylum
my life is not so purposeless as it appears
also let me assure you that the politician is not dangerously imminent and that anyway he is a very desirable politician even though his views on tariff and single tax and tradeunionism do not exactly coincide with jervis's
your desire to dedicate my life to the public good is very sweet but you should look at it from the asylum's point of view
have you no pity for those poor defenseless little orphan children
i have if you haven't and i respectfully decline the position which you offer
i shall be charmed however to accept your invitation to visit you in new york though i must acknowledge that i am not very excited over the list of gaieties you have planned
please substitute for the new york orphanage and the foundling hospital a few theaters and operas and a dinner or so
i have two new evening gowns and a blue and gold coat with a white fur collar
i dash to pack them so telegraph fast if you don't wish to see me for myself alone but only as a successor to mrs lippett
yours as ever  entirely frivolous  and intending to remain so  sallie mcbride
ps
your invitation is especially seasonable
a charming young politician named gordon hallock is to be in new york next week
i am sure you will like him when you know him better
ps

sallie taking her afternoon walk as judy would like to see her   i ask you again have you both gone mad
the john grier home  february 
dear judy  we arrived in a snowstorm at eleven last night singapore and jane and i
it does not appear to be customary for superintendents of orphan asylums to bring with them personal maids and chinese chows
the night watchman and housekeeper who had waited up to receive me were thrown into an awful flutter
they had never seen the like of sing and thought that i was introducing a wolf into the fold
i reassured them as to his dogginess and the watchman after studying his black tongue ventured a witticism
he wanted to know if i fed him on huckleberry pie
it was difficult to find accommodations for my family
poor sing was dragged off whimpering to a strange woodshed and given a piece of burlap
jane did not fare much better
there was not an extra bed in the building barring a fivefoot crib in the hospital room
she as you know approaches six
we tucked her in and she spent the night folded up like a jackknife
she has limped about today looking like a decrepit letter s openly deploring this latest escapade on the part of her flighty mistress and longing for the time when we shall come to our senses and return to the parental fireside in worcester
i know that she is going to spoil all my chances of being popular with the rest of the staff
having her here is the silliest idea that was ever conceived but you know my family
i fought their objections step by step but they made their last stand on jane
if i brought her along to see that i ate nourishing food and didn't stay up all night i might cometemporarily but if i refused to bring heroh dear me i am not sure that i was ever again to cross the threshold of stone gate
so here we are and neither of us very welcome i am afraid
i woke by a gong at six this morning and lay for a time listening to the racket that twentyfive little girls made in the lavatory over my head
it appears that they do not get bathsjust facewashesbut they make as much splashing as twentyfive puppies in a pool
i rose and dressed and explored a bit
you were wise in not having me come to look the place over before i engaged
while my little charges were at breakfast it seemed a happy time to introduce myself so i sought the dining room
horror piled on horrorthose bare drab walls and oilclothcovered tables with tin cups and plates and wooden benches and by way of decoration that one illuminated text the lord will provide
the trustee who added that last touch must possess a grim sense of humor
really judy i never knew there was any spot in the world so entirely ugly and when i saw those rows and rows of pale listless blueuniformed children the whole dismal business suddenly struck me with such a shock that i almost collapsed
it seemed like an unachievable goal for one person to bring sunshine to one hundred little faces when what they need is a mother apiece
i plunged into this thing lightly enough partly because you were too persuasive and mostly i honestly think because that scurrilous gordon hallock laughed so uproariously at the idea of my being able to manage an asylum
between you all you hypnotized me
and then of course after i began reading up on the subject and visiting all those seventeen institutions i got excited over orphans and wanted to put my own ideas into practice
but now i'm aghast at finding myself here it's such a stupendous undertaking
the future health and happiness of a hundred human beings lie in my hands to say nothing of their three or four hundred children and thousand grandchildren
the thing's geometrically progressive
it's awful
who am i to undertake this job
look oh look for another superintendent
jane says dinner's ready
having eaten two of your institution meals the thought of another doesn't excite me
later
the staff had mutton hash and spinach with tapioca pudding for dessert
what the children had i hate to consider
i started to tell you about my first official speech at breakfast this morning
it dealt with all the wonderful new changes that are to come to the john grier home through the generosity of mr jervis pendleton the president of our board of trustees and of mrs pendleton the dear aunt judy of every little boy and girl here
please don't object to my featuring the pendleton family so prominently
i did it for political reasons
as the entire working staff of the institution was present i thought it a good opportunity to emphasize the fact that all of these upsetting innovations come straight from headquarters and not out of my excitable brain
the children stopped eating and stared
the conspicuous color of my hair and the frivolous tilt of my nose are evidently new attributes in a superintendent
my colleagues also showed plainly that they consider me too young and too inexperienced to be set in authority
i haven't seen jervis's wonderful scotch doctor yet but i assure you that he will have to be very wonderful to make up for the rest of these people especially the kindergarten teacher
miss snaith and i clashed early on the subject of fresh air but i intend to get rid of this dreadful institution smell if i freeze every child into a little ice statue
this being a sunny sparkling snowy afternoon i ordered that dungeon of a playroom closed and the children out of doors
she's chasin' us out i heard one small urchin grumbling as he struggled into a twoyearstoosmall overcoat
they simply stood about the yard all humped in their clothes waiting patiently to be allowed to come back in
no running or shouting or coasting or snowballs
think of it
these children don't know how to play
still later
i have already begun the congenial task of spending your money
i bought eleven hotwater bottles this afternoon every one that the village drug store contained likewise some woolen blankets and padded quilts
and the windows are wide open in the babies' dormitory
those poor little tots are going to enjoy the perfectly new sensation of being able to breathe at night
there are a million things i want to grumble about but it's halfpast ten and jane says i must go to bed
yours in command  sallie mcbride
ps
before turning in i tiptoed through the corridor to make sure that all was right and what do you think i found
miss snaith softly closing the windows in the babies' dormitory
just as soon as i can find a suitable position for her in an old ladies' home i am going to discharge that woman
jane takes the pen from my hand
good night
the john grier home  february 
dear judy  dr robin macrae called this afternoon to make the acquaintance of the new superintendent
please invite him to dinner upon the occasion of his next visit to new york and see for yourself what your husband has done
jervis grossly misrepresented the facts when he led me to believe that one of the chief advantages of my position would be the daily intercourse with a man of dr macrae's polish and brilliancy and scholarliness and charm
he is tall and thinnish with sandy hair and cold gray eyes
during the hour he spent in my society and i was very sprightly no shadow of a smile so much as lightened the straight line of his mouth
can a shadow lighten
maybe not but anyway what is the matter with the man
has he committed some remorseful crime or is his taciturnity due merely to his natural scotchness
he's as companionable as a granite tombstone
incidentally our doctor didn't like me any more than i liked him
he thinks i'm frivolous and inconsequential and totally unfitted for this position of trust
i dare say jervis has had a letter from him by now asking to have me removed
in the matter of conversation we didn't hit it off in the least
he discussed broadly and philosophically the evils of institutional care for dependent children while i lightly deplored the unbecoming coiffure that prevails among our girls
to prove my point i had in sadie kate my special errand orphan
her hair is strained back as tightly as though it had been done with a monkey wrench and is braided behind into two wiry little pigtails
decidedly orphans' ears need to be softened
but dr robin macrae doesn't give a hang whether their ears are becoming or not what he cares about is their stomachs
we also split upon the subject of red petticoats
i don't see how any little girl can preserve any selfrespect when dressed in a red flannel petticoat an irregular inch longer than her blue checked gingham dress but he thinks that red petticoats are cheerful and warm and hygienic
i foresee a warlike reign for the new superintendent
in regard to the doctor there is just one detail to be thankful for he is almost as new as i am and he cannot instruct me in the traditions of the asylum
i don't believe i could have worked with the old doctor who judging from the specimens of his art that he left behind knew as much about babies as a veterinary surgeon
in the matter of asylum etiquette the entire staff has undertaken my education
even the cook this morning told me firmly that the john grier home has corn meal mush on wednesday nights
are you searching hard for another superintendent
i'll stay until she comes but please find her fast
yours  with my mind made up  sallie mcbride
sup't's office  john grier home  february 
dear gordon  are you still insulted because i wouldn't take your advice
don't you know that a reddishhaired person of irish forebears with a dash of scotch can't be driven but must be gently led
had you been less obnoxiously insistent i should have listened sweetly and been saved
as it is i frankly confess that i have spent the last five days in repenting our quarrel
you were right and i was wrong and as you see i handsomely acknowledge it
if i ever emerge from this present predicament i shall in the future be guided almost always by your judgment
could any woman make a more sweeping retraction than that
the romantic glamour which judy cast over this orphan asylum exists only in her poetic imagination
the place is awful
words can't tell you how dreary and dismal and smelly it is long corridors bare walls blueuniformed doughfaced little inmates that haven't the slightest resemblance to human children
and oh the dreadful institution smell
a mingling of wet scrubbed floors unaired rooms and food for a hundred people always steaming on the stove
the asylum not only has to be made over but every child as well and it's too herculean a task for such a selfish luxurious and lazy person as sallie mcbride ever to have undertaken
i'm resigning the very first moment that judy can find a suitable successor but that i fear will not be immediately
she has gone off south leaving me stranded and of course after having promised i can't simply abandon her asylum
but in the meantime i assure you that i'm homesick
write me a cheering letter and send a flower to brighten my private drawing room
i inherited it furnished from mrs lippett
the wall is covered with a tapestry paper in brown and red the furniture is electricblue plush except the center table which is gilt
green predominates in the carpet
if you presented some pink rosebuds they would complete the color scheme
i really was obnoxious that last evening but you are avenged
remorsefully yours  sallie mcbride
ps
you needn't have been so grumpy about the scotch doctor
the man is everything dour that the word scotch implies
i detest him on sight and he detests me
oh we're going to have a sweet time working together    the john grier home  february 
my dear gordon  your vigorous and expensive message is here
i know that you have plenty of money but that is no reason why you should waste it so frivolously
when you feel so bursting with talk that only a hundredword telegram will relieve an explosion at least turn it into a night lettergram
my orphans can use the money if you don't need it
also my dear sir please use a trifle of common sense
of course i can't chuck the asylum in the casual manner you suggest
it wouldn't be fair to judy and jervis
if you will pardon the statement they have been my friends for many more years than you and i have no intention of letting them go hang
i came up here in a spirit ofwell say adventure and i must see the venture through
you wouldn't like me if i were a short sport
this doesn't mean however that i am sentencing myself for life i am intending to resign just as soon as the opportunity comes
but really i ought to feel somewhat gratified that the pendletons were willing to trust me with such a responsible post
though you my dear sir do not suspect it i possess considerable executive ability and more common sense than is visible on the surface
if i chose to put my whole soul into this enterprise i could make the rippingest superintendent that any  orphans ever had
i suppose you think that's funny
it's true
judy and jervis know it and that's why they asked me to come
so you see when they have shown so much confidence in me i can't throw them over in quite the unceremonious fashion you suggest
so long as i am here i am going to accomplish just as much as it is given one person to accomplish every twentyfour hours
i am going to turn the place over to my successor with things moving fast in the right direction
but in the meantime please don't wash your hands of me under the belief that i'm too busy to be homesick for i'm not
i wake up every morning and stare at mrs lippett's wallpaper in a sort of daze feeling as though it's some bad dream and i'm not really here
what on earth was i thinking of to turn my back upon my nice cheerful own home and the good times that by rights are mine
i frequently agree with your opinion of my sanity
but why may i ask should you be making such a fuss
you wouldn't be seeing me in any case
worcester is quite as far from washington as the john grier home
and i will add for your further comfort that whereas there is no man in the neighborhood of this asylum who admires red hair in worcester there are several
therefore most difficult of men please be appeased
i didn't come entirely to spite you
i wanted an adventure in life and oh dear
oh dear
i'm having it
please write soon and cheer me up
yours in sackcloth  sallie
the john grier home  february 
dear judy  you tell jervis that i am not hasty at forming judgments
i have a sweet sunny unsuspicious nature and i like everybody almost
but no one could like that scotch doctor
he never smiles
he paid me another visit this afternoon
i invited him to accommodate himself in one of mrs lippett's electricblue chairs and then sat down opposite to enjoy the harmony
he was dressed in a mustardcolored homespun with a dash of green and a glint of yellow in the weave a heather mixture calculated to add life to a dull scotch moor
purple socks and a red tie with an amethyst pin completed the picture
clearly your paragon of a doctor is not going to be of much assistance in pulling up the esthetic tone of this establishment
during the fifteen minutes of his call he succinctly outlined all the changes he wishes to see accomplished in this institution
he forsooth
and what may i ask are the duties of a superintendent
is she merely a figurehead to take orders from the visiting physician
it's up wi' the bonnets o' mcbride and macrae
i am  indignantly yours sallie
the john grier home  monday
dear dr macrae  i am sending this note by sadie kate as it seems impossible to reach you by telephone
is the person who calls herself mrs mcgurrk and hangs up in the middle of a sentence your housekeeper
if she answers the telephone often i don't see how your patients have any patience left
as you did not come this morning per agreement and the painters did come i was fain to choose a cheerful corn color to be placed upon the walls of your new laboratory room
i trust there is nothing unhygienic about corn color
also if you can spare a moment this afternoon kindly motor yourself to dr brice's on water street and look at the dentist's chair and appurtenances which are to be had at halfprice
if all of the pleasant paraphernalia of his profession were herein a corner of your laboratorydr brice could finish his  new patients with much more despatch than if we had to transport them separately to water street
don't you think that's a useful idea
it came to me in the middle of the night but as i never happened to buy a dentist's chair before i'd appreciate some professional advice
yours truly  s mcbride
the john grier home  march 
dear judy  do stop sending me telegrams
of course i know that you want to know everything that is happening and i would send a daily bulletin but i truly don't find a minute
i am so tired when night comes that if it weren't for jane's strict discipline i should go to bed with my clothes on
later when we slip a little more into routine and i can be sure that my assistants are all running off their respective jobs i shall be the regularest correspondent you ever had
it was five days ago wasn't it that i wrote
things have been happening in those five days
the macrae and i have mapped out a plan of campaign and are stirring up this place to its sluggish depths
i like him less and less but we have declared a sort of working truce
and the man is a worker
i always thought i had sufficient energy myself but when an improvement is to be introduced i toil along panting in his wake
he is as stubborn and tenacious and bulldoggish as a scotchman can be but he does understand babies that is he understands their physiological aspects
he hasn't any more feeling for them personally than for so many frogs that he might happen to be dissecting
do you remember jervis's holding forth one evening for an hour or so about our doctor's beautiful humanitarian ideals
c'est a rire
the man merely regards the j g h as his own private laboratory where he can try out scientific experiments with no loving parents to object
i shouldn't be surprised anyday to find him introducing scarlet fever cultures into the babies' porridge in order to test a newly invented serum
of the house staff the only two who strike me as really efficient are the primary teacher and the furnaceman
you should see how the children run to meet miss matthews and beg for caresses and how painstakingly polite they are to the other teachers
children are quick to size up character
i shall be very embarrassed if they are too polite to me
just as soon as i get my bearings a little and know exactly what we need i am going to accomplish some widespread discharging
i should like to begin with miss snaith but i discover that she is the niece of one of our most generous trustees and isn't exactly dischargeable
she's a vague chinless paleeyed creature who talks through her nose and breathes through her mouth
she can't say anything decisively and then stop her sentences all trail off into incoherent murmurings
every time i see the woman i feel an almost uncontrollable desire to take her by the shoulders and shake some decision into her
and miss snaith is the one who has had entire supervision of the seventeen little tots aged from two to five
but anyway even if i can't discharge her i have reduced her to a subordinate position without her being aware of the fact
the doctor has found for me a charming girl who lives a few miles from here and comes in every day to manage the kindergarten
she has big gentle brown eyes like a cow's and motherly manners she is just nineteen and the babies love her
at the head of the nursery i have placed a jolly comfortable middleaged woman who has reared five of her own and has a hand with bairns
our doctor also found her
you see he is useful
she is technically under miss snaith but is usurping dictatorship in a satisfactory fashion
i can now sleep at night without being afraid that my babies are being inefficiently murdered
you see our reforms are getting started and while i acquiesce with all the intelligence at my command to our doctor's basic scientific upheavals still they sometimes leave me cold
the problem that keeps churning and churning in my mind is how can i ever instil enough love and warmth and sunshine into those bleak little lives
and i am not sure that the doctor's science will accomplish that
one of our most pressing intelligent needs just now is to get our records into coherent form
the books have been most outrageously unkept
mrs lippett had a big black account book into which she jumbled any facts that happened to drift her way as to the children's family their conduct and their health
but for weeks at a time she didn't trouble to make an entry
if any adopting family wants to know a child's parentage half the time we can't even tell where we got the child
where did you come from baby dear
the blue sky opened and i am here  is an exact description of their arrival
we need a field worker to travel about the country and pick up all the hereditary statistics she can about our chicks
it will be an easy matter as most of them have relatives
what do you think of janet ware for the job
you remember what a shark she was in economics she simply battened on tables and charts and surveys
i have also to inform you that the john grier home is undergoing a very searching physical examination and it is the shocking truth that out of the twentyeight poor little rats so far examined only five are up to specification
and the five have not been here long
do you remember the ugly green reception room on the first floor
i have removed as much of its greenness as possible and fitted it up as the doctor's laboratory
it contains scales and drugs and most professional touch of all a dentist's chair and one of those sweet grinding machines
bought them secondhand from doctor brice in the village who is putting in for the gratification of his own patients white enamel and nickelplate
that drilling machine is looked upon as an infernal engine and i as an infernal monster for instituting it
but every little victim who is discharged filled may come to my room every day for a week and receive two pieces of chocolate
though our children are not conspicuously brave they are we discover fighters
young thomas kehoe nearly bit the doctor's thumb in two after kicking over a tableful of instruments
it requires physical strength as well as skill to be dental adviser to the j g h          
interrupted here to show a benevolent lady over the institution
she asked fifty irrelevant questions took up an hour of my time then finally wiped away a tear and left a dollar for my poor little charges
so far my poor little charges are not enthusiastic about these new reforms
they don't care much for the sudden draft of fresh air that has blown in upon them or the deluge of water
i am shoving in two baths a week and as soon as we collect tubs enough and a few extra faucets they are going to get seven
but at least i have started one most popular reform
our daily bill of fare has been increased a change deplored by the cook as causing trouble and deplored by the rest of the staff as causing an immoral increase in expense
economy spelt in capitals has been the guiding principle of this institution for so many years that it has become a religion
i assure my timid coworkers twenty times a day that owing to the generosity of our president the endowment has been exactly doubled and that i have vast sums besides from mrs pendleton for necessary purposes like ice cream
but they simply can't get over the feeling that it is a wicked extravagance to feed these children
the doctor and i have been studying with care the menus of the past and we are filled with amazement at the mind that could have devised them
here is one of her frequently recurring dinners  boiled potatoes boiled rice blanc mange   it's a wonder to me that the children are anything more than one hundred and eleven little lumps of starch
looking about this institution one is moved to misquote robert browning
there may be heaven there must be hell      meantime there is the john grierwell

the john grier home  saturday
dear judy  dr robin macrae and i fought another battle yesterday over a very trivial matter in which i was right and since then i have adopted for our doctor a special pet name
good morning enemy
was my greeting today at which he was quite solemnly annoyed
he says he does not wish to be regarded as an enemy
he is not in the least antagonisticso long as i mold my policy upon his wishes
we have two new children isador gutschneider and max yog given to us by the baptist ladies' aid society
where on earth do you suppose those children picked up such a religion
i didn't want to take them but the poor ladies were very persuasive and they pay the princely sum of four dollars and fifty cents per week per child
this makes  which makes us very crowded
i have half a dozen babies to give away
find me some kind families who want to adopt
you know it's very embarrassing not to be able to remember offhand how large your family is but mine seems to vary from day to day like the stock market
i should like to keep it at about par
when a woman has more than a hundred children she can't give them the individual attention they ought to have
monday
this letter has been lying two days on my desk and i haven't found the time to stick on a stamp
but now i seem to have a free evening ahead so i will add a page or two more before starting it on a pleasant journey to florida
i am just beginning to pick out individual faces among the children
it seemed at first as though i could never learn them they looked so hopelessly cut out of one pattern with those unspeakably ugly uniforms
now please don't write back that you want the children put into new clothes immediately
i know you do you've already told me five times
in about a month i shall be ready to consider the question but just now their insides are more important than their outsides
there is no doubt about itorphans in the mass do not appeal to me
i am beginning to be afraid that this famous mother instinct which we hear so much about was left out of my character
children as children are dirty spitty little things and their noses all need wiping
here and there i pick out a naughty mischievous little one that awakens a flicker of interest but for the most part they are just a composite blur of white face and blue check
with one exception though
sadie kate kilcoyne emerged from the mass the first day and bids fair to stay out for all time
she is my special little errand girl and she furnishes me with all my daily amusement
no piece of mischief has been launched in this institution for the last eight years that did not originate in her abnormal brain
this young person has to me a most unusual history though i understand it's common enough in foundling circles
she was discovered eleven years ago on the bottom step of a thirtyninth street house asleep in a pasteboard box labeled altman  co  sadie kate kilcoyne aged five weeks
be kind to her was neatly printed on the cover
the policeman who picked her up took her to bellevue where the foundlings are pronounced in the order of their arrival catholic protestant catholic protestant with perfect impartiality
our sadie kate despite her name and blue irish eyes was made a protestant
and here she is growing irisher and irisher every day but true to her christening protesting loudly against every detail of life
her two little black braids point in opposite directions her little monkey face is all screwed up with mischief she is as active as a terrier and you have to keep her busy every moment
her record of badnesses occupies pages in the doomsday book
the last item reads  for stumping maggie geer to get a doorknob into her mouthpunishment the afternoon spent in bed and crackers for supper
it seems that maggie geer fitted with a mouth of unusual stretching capacity got the doorknob in but couldn't get it out
the doctor was called and cannily solved the problem with a buttered shoehorn
mucklemouthed meg he has dubbed the patient ever since
you can understand that my thoughts are anxiously occupied in filling every crevice of sadie kate's existence
there are a million subjects that i ought to consult with the president about
i think it was very unkind of you and him to saddle me with your orphan asylum and run off south to play
it would serve you right if i did everything wrong
while you are traveling about in private cars and strolling in the moonlight on palm beaches please think of me in the drizzle of a new york march taking care of  babies that by rights are yoursand be grateful
i remain for a limited time  s mcbride
sup't john grier home
dear enemy  i am sending herewith under separate cover sammy speir who got mislaid when you paid your morning visit
miss snaith brought him to light after you had gone
please scrutinize his thumb
i never saw a felon but i have diagnosed it as such
yours truly s mcbride
sup't john grier home  march 
dear judy  i don't know yet whether the children are going to love me or not but they do love my dog
no creature so popular as singapore ever entered these gates
every afternoon three boys who have been perfect in deportment are allowed to brush and comb him while three other good boys may serve him with food and drink
but every saturday morning the climax of the week is reached when three superlatively good boys give him a nice lathery bath with hot water and flea soap
the privilege of serving as singapore's valet is going to be the only incentive i shall need for maintaining discipline
but isn't it pathetically unnatural for these youngsters to be living in the country and never owning a pet
especially when they of all children do so need something to love
i am going to manage pets for them somehow if i have to spend our new endowment for a menagerie
couldn't you bring back some baby alligators and a pelican
anything alive will be gratefully received
this should by rights be my first trustees' day
i am deeply grateful to jervis for arranging a simple business meeting in new york as we are not yet on dress parade up here but we are hoping by the first wednesday in april to have something visible to show
if all of the doctor's ideas and a few of my own get themselves materialized our trustees will open their eyes a bit when we show them about
i have just made out a chart for next week's meals and posted it in the kitchen in the sight of an aggrieved cook
variety is a word hitherto not found in the lexicon of the jgh
you would never dream all of the delightful surprises we are going to have brown bread corn pone graham muffins samp rice pudding with lots of raisins thick vegetable soup macaroni italian fashion polenta cakes with molasses apple dumplings gingerbreadoh an endless list
after our biggest girls have assisted in the manufacture of such appetizing dainties they will almost be capable of keeping future husbands in love with them
oh dear me
here i am babbling these silly nothings when i have some real news up my sleeve
we have a new worker a gem of a worker
do you remember betsy kindred 
she led the glee club and was president of dramatics
i remember her perfectly she always had lovely clothes
well if you please she lives only twelve miles from here
i ran across her by chance yesterday morning as she was motoring through the village or rather she just escaped running across me
i never spoke to her in my life but we greeted each other like the oldest friends
it pays to have conspicuous hair she recognized me instantly
i hopped upon the running board of her car and said  betsy kindred  you've got to come back to my orphan asylum and help me catalogue my orphans
and it astonished her so that she came
she's to be here four or five days a week as temporary secretary and somehow i must manage to keep her permanently
she's the most useful person i ever saw
i am hoping that orphans will become such a habit with her that she won't be able to give them up
i think she might stay if we pay her a big enough salary
she likes to be independent of her family as do all of us in these degenerate times
in my growing zeal for cataloguing people i should like to get our doctor tabulated
if jervis knows any gossip about him write it to me please the worse the better
he called yesterday to lance a felon on sammy speir's thumb then ascended to my electricblue parlor to give instructions as to the dressing of thumbs
the duties of a superintendent are manifold
it was just teatime so i casually asked him to stay and he did
not for the pleasure of my societyno indeedbut because jane appeared at the moment with a plate of toasted muffins
he hadn't had any luncheon it seems and dinner was a long way ahead
between muffins he ate the whole plateful he saw fit to interrogate me as to my preparedness for this position
had i studied biology in college
how far had i gone in chemistry
what did i know of sociology
had i visited that model institution at hastings
to all of which i responded affably and openly
then i permitted myself a question or two just what sort of youthful training had been required to produce such a model of logic accuracy dignity and common sense as i saw sitting before me
through persistent prodding i elicited a few forlorn facts but all quite respectable
you'd think from his reticence there'd been a hanging in the family
the macrae pere was born in scotland and came to the states to occupy a chair at johns hopkins son robin was shipped back to auld reekie for his education
his grandmother was a m'lachlan of strathlachan i am sure she sounds respectable and his vacations were spent in the hielands achasing the deer
so much could i gather so much and no more
tell me i beg some gossip about my enemysomething scandalous by preference
why if he is such an awfully efficient person does he bury himself in this remote locality
you would think an upandcoming scientific man would want a hospital at one elbow and a morgue at the other
are you sure that he didn't commit a crime and isn't hiding from the law
i seem to have covered a lot of paper without telling you much
vive la bagatelle
yours as usual  sallie
ps
i am relieved on one point
dr macrae does not pick out his own clothes
he leaves all such unessential trifles to his housekeeper mrs maggie mcgurk
again and irrevocably goodby
the john grier home  wednesday
dear gordon  your roses and your letter cheered me for an entire morning and it's the first time i've approached cheerfulness since the fourteenth of february when i waved goodby to worcester
words can't tell you how monotonously oppressive the daily round of institution life gets to be
the only glimmer in the whole dull affair is the fact that betsy kindred spends four days a week with us
betsy and i were in college together and we do occasionally find something funny to laugh about
yesterday we were having tea in my hideous parlor when we suddenly determined to revolt against so much unnecessary ugliness
we called in six sturdy and destructive orphans a stepladder and a bucket of hot water and in two hours had every vestige of that tapestry paper off those walls
you can't imagine what fun it is ripping paper off walls
two paperhangers are at work this moment hanging the best that our village affords while a german upholsterer is on his knees measuring my chairs for chintz slip covers that will hide every inch of their plush upholstery
please don't get nervous
this doesn't mean that i'm preparing to spend my life in the asylum
it means only that i'm preparing a cheerful welcome for my successor
i haven't dared tell judy how dismal i find it because i don't want to cloud florida but when she returns to new york she will find my official resignation waiting to meet her in the front hall
i would write you a long letter in grateful payment for seven pages but two of my little dears are holding a fight under the window
i dash to separate them
yours as ever  s mcb
the john grier home  march 
my dear judy  i myself have bestowed a little present upon the john grier homethe refurnishing of the superintendent's private parlor
i saw the first night here that neither i nor any future occupant could be happy with mrs lippett's electric plush
you see i am planning to make my successor contented and willing to stay
betsy kindred assisted in the rehabilitation of the lippett's chamber of horrors and between us we have created a symphony in dull blue and gold
really and truly it's one of the loveliest rooms you've ever seen
the sight of it will be an artistic education to any orphan
new paper on the wall new rugs on the floor my own prized persians expressed from worcester by an expostulating family
new casement curtains at my three windows revealing a wide and charming view hitherto hidden by nottingham lace
a new big table some lamps and books and a picture or so and a real open fire
she had closed the fireplace because it let in air
i never realized what a difference artistic surroundings make in the peace of one's soul
i sat last night and watched my fire throw nice highlights on my new old fender and purred with contentment
and i assure you it's the first purr that has come from this cat since she entered the gates of the john grier home
but the refurnishing of the superintendent's parlor is the slightest of our needs
the children's private apartments demand so much basic attention that i can't decide where to begin
that dark north playroom is a shocking scandal but no more shocking than our hideous dining room or our unventilated dormitories or our tubless lavatories
if the institution is very saving do you think it can ever afford to burn down this smelly old original building and put up instead some nice ventilated modern cottages
i cannot contemplate that wonderful institution at hastings without being filled with envy
it would be some fun to run an asylum if you had a plant like that to work with
but anyway when you get back to new york and are ready to consult the architect about remodeling please apply to me for suggestions
among other little details i want two hundred feet of sleeping porch running along the outside of our dormitories
you see it's this way our physical examination reveals the fact that about half of our children are aenemicaneamicanaemic mercy
what a word
 and a lot of them have tubercular ancestors and more have alcoholic
their first need is oxygen rather than education
and if the sickly ones need it why wouldn't it be good for the well ones
i should like to have every child winter and summer sleeping in the open air but i know that if i let fall such a bomb on the board of trustees the whole body would explode
speaking of trustees i have met up with the hon
cyrus wykoff and i really believe that i dislike him more than dr robin macrae or the kindergarten teacher or the cook
i seem to have a genius for discovering enemies
mr wykoff called on wednesday last to look over the new superintendent
having lowered himself into my most comfortable armchair he proceeded to spend the day
he asked my father's business and whether or not he was welltodo
i told him that my father manufactured overalls and that even in these hard times the demand for overalls was pretty steady
he seemed relieved
he approves of the utilitarian aspect of overalls
he had been afraid that i had come from the family of a minister or professor or writer a lot of high thinking and no common sense
cyrus believes in common sense
and what had been my training for this position
that as you know is a slightly embarrassing question
but i produced my college education and a few lectures at the school of philanthropy also a short residence in the college settlement i didn't tell him that all i had done there was to paint the back hall and stairs
then i submitted some social work among my father's employees and a few friendly visits to the home for female inebriates
to all of which he grunted
i added that i had lately made a study of the care of dependent children and casually mentioned my seventeen institutions
he grunted again and said he didn't take much stock in this newfangled scientific charity
at this point jane entered with a box of roses from the florist's
that blessed gordon hallock sends me roses twice a week to brighten the rigors of institution life
our trustee began an indignant investigation
he wished to know where i got those flowers and was visibly relieved when he learned that i had not spent the institution's money for them
he next wished to know who jane might be
i had foreseen that question and decided to brazen it out
my maid said i
your what
he bellowed quite red in the face
my maid
what is she doing here
i amiably went into details
she mends my clothes blacks my boots keeps my bureau drawers in order washes my hair
i really thought the man would choke so i charitably added that i paid her wages out of my own private income and paid five dollars and fifty cents a week to the institution for her board and that though she was big she didn't eat much
he allowed that i might make use of one of the orphans for all legitimate service
i explainedstill polite but growing boredthat jane had been in my service for many years and was indispensable
he finally took himself off after telling me that he for one had never found any fault with mrs lippett
she was a commonsense christian woman without many fancy ideas but with plenty of good solid work in her
he hoped that i would be wise enough to model my policy upon hers
and what my dear judy do you think of that
the doctor dropped in a few minutes later and i repeated the hon
cyrus's conversation in detail
for the first time in the history of our intercourse the doctor and i agreed
mrs lippett indeed
he growled
the blethering auld gomerel
may the lord send him mair sense
when our doctor really becomes aroused he drops into scotch
my latest pet name for him behind his back is sandy
sadie kate is sitting on the floor as i write untangling sewingsilks and winding them neatly for jane who is becoming quite attached to the little imp
i am writing to your aunt judy say i to sadie kate
what message shall i send from you
i never heard of no aunt judy
she is the aunt of every good little girl in this school
tell her to come and visit me and bring some candy says sadie kate
i say so too
my love to the president  sallie
march 
mrs judy abbott pendleton  dear madam  your four letters two telegrams and three checks are at hand and your instructions shall be obeyed just as quickly as this overworked superintendent can manage it
i delegated the dining room job to betsy kindred
one hundred dollars did i allow her for the rehabilitation of that dreary apartment
she accepted the trust picked out five likely orphans to assist in the mechanical details and closed the door
for three days the children have been eating from the desks in the schoolroom
i haven't an idea what betsy is doing but she has a lot better taste than i so there isn't much use in interfering
it is such a heavensent relief to be able to leave something to somebody else and be sure it will be carried out
with all due respect to the age and experience of the staff i found here they are not very open to new ideas
as the john grier home was planned by its noble founder in  so shall it be run today
incidentally my dear judy your idea of a private dining room for the superintendent which i being a social soul at first scorned has been my salvation
when i am dead tired i dine alone but in my live intervals i invite an officer to share the meal and in the expansive intimacy of the dinnertable i get in my most effective strokes
when it becomes desirable to plant the seeds of fresh air in the soul of miss snaith i invite her to dinner and tactfully sandwich in a little oxygen between her slices of pressed veal
pressed veal is our cook's idea of an acceptable piece de resistance for a dinner party
in another month i am going to face the subject of suitable nourishment for the executive staff
meanwhile there are so many things more important than our own comfort that we shall have to worry along on veal
a terrible bumping has just occurred outside my door
one little cherub seems to be kicking another little cherub downstairs
but i write on undisturbed
if i am to spend my days among orphans i must cultivate a cheerful detachment
did you get leonora fenton's cards
she's marrying a medical missionary and going to siam to live
did you ever hear of anything so absurd as leonora presiding over a missionary's menage
do you suppose she will entertain the heathen with skirt dances
it isn't any absurder though than me in an orphan asylum or you as a conservative settled matron or marty keene a social butterfly in paris
do you suppose she goes to embassy balls in riding clothes and what on earth does she do about hair
it couldn't have grown so soon she must wear a wig
isn't our class turning out some hilarious surprises
the mail arrives
excuse me while i read a nice fat letter from washington
not so nice quite impertinent
gordon can't get over the idea that it is a joke s mcb
in conjunction with one hundred and thirteen orphans
but he wouldn't think it such a joke if he could try it for a few days
he says he is going to drop off here on his next trip north and watch the struggle
how would it be if i left him in charge while i dashed to new york to accomplish some shopping
our sheets are all worn out and we haven't more than two hundred and eleven blankets in the house
singapore sole puppy of my heart and home sends his respectful love
i also s mcb
the john grier home  friday
my dearest judy  you should see what your hundred dollars and betsy kindred did to that dining room
it's a dazzling dream of yellow paint
being a north room she thought to brighten it and she has
the walls are kalsomined buff with a frieze of little molly cottontails skurrying around the top
all of the woodworktables and benches includedis a cheerful chrome yellow
instead of tablecloths which we can't afford we have linen runners with stenciled rabbits hopping along their length
also yellow bowls filled at present with pussywillows but looking forward to dandelions and cowslips and buttercups
and new dishes my dearwhite with yellow jonquils we think though they may be roses there is no botany expert in the house
most wonderful touch of all we have napkins the first we have seen in our whole lives
the children thought they were handkerchiefs and ecstatically wiped their noses
to honor the opening of the new room we had icecream and cake for dessert
it is such a pleasure to see these children anything but cowed and apathetic that i am offering prizes for boisterousnessto every one but sadie kate
she drummed on the table with her knife and fork and sang welcome to dem golden halls
you remember that illuminated text over the diningroom doorthe lord will provide
we've painted it out and covered the spot with rabbits
it's all very well to teach so easy a belief to normal children who have a proper family and roof behind them but a person whose only refuge in distress will be a park bench must learn a more militant creed than that
the lord has given you two hands and a brain and a big world to use them in
use them well and you will be provided for use them ill and you will want is our motto and that with reservations
in the sorting process that has been going on i have got rid of eleven children
that blessed state charities aid association helped me dispose of three little girls all placed in very nice homes and one to be adopted legally if the family likes her
and the family will like her i saw to that
she was the prize child of the institution obedient and polite with curly hair and affectionate ways exactly the little girl that every family needs
when a couple of adopting parents are choosing a daughter i stand by with my heart in my mouth feeling as though i were assisting in the inscrutable designs of fate
such a little thing turns the balance
the child smiles and a loving home is hers for life she sneezes and it passes her by forever
three of our biggest boys have gone to work on farms one of them out west to a ranch
report has it that he is to become a cowboy and indian fighter and grizzlybear hunter though i believe in reality he is to engage in the pastoral work of harvesting wheat
he marched off a hero of romance followed by the wistful eyes of twentyfive adventurous lads who turned back with a sigh to the safely monotonous life of the j g h  five other children have been sent to their proper institutions
one of them is deaf one an epileptic and the other three approaching idiocy
none of them ought ever to have been accepted here
this as an educational institution and we can't waste our valuable plant in caring for defectives
orphan asylums have gone out of style
what i am going to develop is a boarding school for the physical moral and mental growth of children whose parents have not been able to provide for their care
orphans is merely my generic term for the children a good many of them are not orphans in the least
they have one troublesome and tenacious parent left who won't sign a surrender so i can't place them out for adoption
but those that are available would be far better off in loving fosterhomes than in the best institution that i can ever make
so i am fitting them for adoption as quickly as possible and searching for the homes
you ought to run across a lot of pleasant families in your travels can't you bully some of them into adopting children
boys by preference
we've got an awful lot of extra boys and nobody wants them
talk about antifeminism
it's nothing to the antimasculinism that exists in the breasts of adopting parents
i could place out a thousand dimpled little girls with yellow hair but a good live boy from nine to thirteen is a drug on the market
there seems to be a general feeling that they track in dirt and scratch up mahogany furniture
shouldn't you think that men's clubs might like to adopt boys as a sort of mascot
the boy could be boarded in a nice respectable family and drawn out by the different members on saturday afternoons
they could take him to ball games and the circus and then return him when they had had enough just as you do with a library book
it would be very valuable training for the bachelors
people are forever talking about the desirability of training girls for motherhood
why not institute a course of training in fatherhood and get the best men's clubs to take it up
will you please have jervis agitate the matter at his various clubs and i'll have gordon start the idea in washington
they both belong to such a lot of clubs that we ought to dispose of at least a dozen boys
i remain  the everdistracted mother of 
s mcb
the john grier home  march 
dear judy  i have been having a pleasant respite from the  cares of motherhood
yesterday who should drop down upon our peaceful village but mr gordon hallock on his way back to washington to resume the cares of the nation
at least he said it was on his way but i notice from the map in the primary room that it was one hundred miles out of his way
and dear but i was glad to see him
he is the first glimpse of the outside world i have had since i was incarcerated in this asylum
and such a lot of entertaining businesses he had to talk about
he knows the inside of all the outside things you read in the newspapers so far as i can make out he is the social center about which washington revolves
i always knew he would get on in politics for he has a way with him there's no doubt about it
you can't imagine how exhilarated and setup i feel as though i'd come into my own again after a period of social ostracism
i must confess that i get lonely for some one who talks my kind of nonsensical talk
betsy trots off home every week end and the doctor is conversational enough but oh so horribly logical
gordon somehow seems to stand for the life i belong toof country clubs and motors and dancing and sport and politenessa poor foolish silly life if you will but mine own
and i have missed it
this serving society business is theoretically admirable and compelling and interesting but deadly stupid in its working details
i am afraid i was never born to set the crooked straight
i tried to show gordon about and make him take an interest in the babies but he wouldn't glance at them
he thinks i came just to spite him which of course i did
your siren call would never have lured me from the path of frivolity had gordon not been so unpleasantly hilarious at the idea of my being able to manage an orphan asylum
i came here to show him that i could and now when i can show him the beast refuses to look
i invited him to dinner with a warning about the pressed veal but he said no thanks that i needed a change
so we went to brantwood inn and had broiled lobster
i had positively forgotten that the creatures were edible
this morning at seven o'clock i was wakened by the furious ringing of the telephone bell
it was gordon at the station about to resume his journey to washington
he was in quite a contrite mood about the asylum and apologized largely for refusing to look at my children
it was not that he didn't like orphans he said it was just that he didn't like them in juxtaposition to me
and to prove his good intentions he would send them a bag of peanuts
i feel as fresh and revivified after my little fling as though i'd had a real vacation
there's no doubt about it an hour or so of exciting talk is more of a tonic to me than a pint of iron and strychnine pills
you owe me two letters dear madam
pay them tout de suite or i lay down my pen forever
yours as usual  s mcb
tuesday  pm my dear enemy  i am told that during my absence this afternoon you paid us a call and dug up a scandal
you claim that the children under miss snaith are not receiving their due in the matter of codliver oil
i am sorry if your medicinal orders have not been carried out but you must know that it is a difficult matter to introduce that abominably smelling stuff into the inside of a squirming child
and poor miss snaith is a very much overworked person
she has ten more children to care for than should rightly fall into the lot of any single woman and until we find her another assistant she has very little time for the fancy touches you demand
also my dear enemy she is very susceptible to abuse
when you feel in a fighting mood i wish you would expend your belligerence upon me
i don't mind it quite the contrary
but that poor lady has retired to her room in a state of hysterics leaving nine babies to be tucked into bed by whomever it may concern
if you have any powders that would be settling to her nerves please send them back by sadie kate
yours truly  s mcbride
wednesday morning
dear dr macrae  i am not taking an unintelligent stand in the least i am simply asking that you come to me with all complaints and not stir up my staff in any such volcanic fashion as that of yesterday
i endeavor to carry out all of your ordersof a medical naturewith scrupulous care
in the present case there seems to have been some negligence i don't know what did become of those fourteen unadministered bottles of codliver oil that you have made such a fuss about but i shall investigate
and i cannot for various reasons pack off miss snaith in the summary fashion you demand
she may be in certain respects inefficient but she is kind to the children and with supervision will answer temporarily
yours truly  s mcbride
thursday
dear enemy  soyez tranquille
i have issued orders and in the future the children shall receive all of the codliver oil that by rights is theirs
a wilfu' man maun hae his way
s mcb
march 
dear judy  asylum life has looked up a trifle during the past few dayssince the great codliver oil war has been raging
the first skirmish occurred on tuesday and i unfortunately missed it having accompanied four of my children on a shopping trip to the village
i returned to find the asylum teeming with hysterics
our explosive doctor had paid us a visit
sandy has two passions in life one is for codliver oil and the other for spinach neither popular in our nursery
some time agobefore i came in facthe had ordered codliver oil for all of the aenemic heavens
there's that word again
aneamicchildren and had given instructions as to its application to miss snaith
yesterday in his suspicious scotch fashion he began nosing about to find out why the poor little rats weren't fattening up as fast as he thought they ought and he unearthed a hideous scandal
they haven't received a whiff of codliver oil for three whole weeks
at that point he exploded and all was joy and excitement and hysterics
betsy says that she had to send sadie kate to the laundry on an improvised errand as his language was not fit for orphan ears
by the time i got home he had gone and miss snaith had retired weeping to her room and the whereabouts of fourteen bottles of codliver oil was still unexplained
he had accused her at the top of his voice of taking them herself
imagine miss snaithshe who looks so innocent and chinless and inoffensivestealing codliver oil from these poor helpless little orphans and guzzling it in private
her defense consisted in hysterical assertions that she loved the children and had done her duty as she saw it
she did not believe in giving medicine to babies she thought drugs bad for their poor little stomachs
you can imagine sandy
oh dear
oh dear
to think i missed it
well the tempest raged for three days and sadie kate nearly ran her little legs off carrying peppery messages back and forth between us and the doctor
it is only under stress that i communicate with him by telephone as he has an interfering old termagant of a housekeeper who listens in on the downstairs switch
i don't wish the scandalous secrets of the john grier spread abroad
the doctor demanded miss snaith's instant dismissal and i refused
of course she is a vague unfocused inefficient old thing but she does love the children and with proper supervision is fairly useful
at least in the light of her exalted family connections i can't pack her off in disgrace like a drunken cook
i am hoping in time to eliminate her by a process of delicate suggestion perhaps i can make her feel that her health requires a winter in california
and also no matter what the doctor wants so positive and dictatorial is his manner that just out of selfrespect one must take the other side
when he states that the world is round i instantly assert it to be triangular
finally after three pleasantly exhilarating days the whole business settled itself
an apology a very dilute one was extracted from him for being so unkind to the poor lady and full confession with promises for the future was drawn from her
it seems that she couldn't bear to make the little dears take the stuff but for obvious reasons she couldn't bear to cross dr macrae so she hid the last fourteen bottles in a dark corner of the cellar
just how she was planning to dispose of her loot i don't know
can you pawn codliver oil
later
peace negotiations had just ended this afternoon and sandy had made a dignified exit when the hon
cyrus wykoff was announced
two enemies in the course of an hour are really too much
the hon
cy was awfully impressed with the new dining room especially when he heard that betsy had put on those rabbits with her own lilywhite hands
stenciling rabbits on walls he allows is a fitting pursuit for a woman but an executive position like mine is a trifle out of her sphere
he thinks it would be far wiser if mr pendleton did not give me such free scope in the spending of his money
while we were still contemplating betsy's mural flight an awful crash came from the pantry and we found gladiola murphy weeping among the ruins of five yellow plates
it is sufficiently shattering to my nerves to hear these crashes when i am alone but it is peculiarly shattering when receiving a call from an unsympathetic trustee
i shall cherish that set of dishes to the best of my ability but if you wish to see your gift in all its uncracked beauty i should advise you to hurry north and visit the john grier home without delay
yours as ever  sallie
march 
my dear judy  i have just been holding an interview with a woman who wants to take a baby home to surprise her husband
i had a hard time convincing her that since he is to support the child it might be a delicate attention to consult him about its adoption
she argued stubbornly that it was none of his business seeing that the onerous work of washing and dressing and training would fall upon her
i am really beginning to feel sorry for men
some of them seem to have very few rights
even our pugnacious doctor i suspect of being a victim of domestic tyranny and his housekeeper's at that
it is scandalous the way maggie mcgurk neglects the poor man
i have had to put him in charge of an orphan
sadie kate with a very housewifely air is this moment sitting crosslegged on the hearth rug sewing buttons on his overcoat while he is upstairs tending babies
you would never believe it but sandy and i are growing quite confidential in a dour scotch fashion
it has become his habit when homeward bound after his professional calls to chug up to our door about four in the afternoon and make the rounds of the house to make sure that we are not developing cholera morbus or infanticide or anything catching and then present himself at fourthirty at my library door to talk over our mutual problems
does he come to see me
oh no indeed he comes to get tea and toast and marmalade
the man hath a lean and hungry look
his housekeeper doesn't feed him enough
as soon as i get the upper hand of him a little more i am going to urge him on to revolt
meanwhile he is very grateful for something to eat but oh so funny in his attempts at social grace
at first he would hold a cup of tea in one hand a plate of muffins in the other and then search blankly for a third hand to eat them with
now he has solved the problem
he turns in his toes and brings his knees together then he folds his napkin into a long narrow wedge that fills the crack between them thus forming a very workable pseudo lap after that he sits with tense muscles until the tea is drunk
i suppose i ought to provide a table but the spectacle of sandy with his toes turned in is the one gleam of amusement that my day affords
the postman is just driving in with i trust a letter from you
letters make a very interesting break in the monotony of asylum life
if you wish to keep this superintendent contented you'd better write often
         mail received and contents noted
kindly convey my thanks to jervis for three alligators in a swamp
he shows rare artistic taste in the selection of his post cards
your sevenpage illustrated letter from miami arrives at the same time
i should have known jervis from the palm tree perfectly even without the label as the tree has so much the more hair of the two
also i have a polite breadandbutter letter from my nice young man in washington and a book from him likewise a box of candy
the bag of peanuts for the kiddies he has shipped by express
did you ever know such assiduity
jimmie favors me with the news that he is coming to visit me as soon as father can spare him from the factory
the poor boy does hate that factory so
it isn't that he is lazy he just simply isn't interested in overalls
but father can't understand such a lack of taste
having built up the factory he of course has developed a passion for overalls which should have been inherited by his eldest son
i find it awfully convenient to have been born a daughter i am not asked to like overalls but am left free to follow any morbid career i may choose such as this
to return to my mail there arrives an advertisement from a wholesale grocer saying that he has exceptionally economical brands of oatmeal rice flour prunes and dried apples that he packs specially for prisons and charitable institutions
sounds nutritious doesn't it
i also have letters from a couple of farmers each of whom would like to have a strong husky boy of fourteen who is not afraid of work their object being to give him a good home
these good homes appear with great frequency just as the spring planting is coming on
when we investigated one of them last week the village minister in answer to our usual question does he own any property
replied in a very guarded manner i think he must own a corkscrew
you would hardly credit some of the homes that we have investigated
we found a very prosperous country family the other day who lived huddled together in three rooms in order to keep the rest of their handsome house clean
the fourteenyear girl they wished to adopt by way of a cheap servant was to sleep in the same tiny room with their own three children
their kitchendiningparlor apartment was more cluttered up and unaired than any city tenement i ever saw and the thermometer at eightyfour
one could scarcely say they were living there they were rather cooking
you may be sure they got no girl from us
i have made one invariable ruleevery other is flexible
no child is to be placed out unless the proposed family can offer better advantages than we can give
i mean than we are going to be able to give in the course of a few months when we get ourselves made over into a model institution
i shall have to confess that at present we are still pretty bad
but anyway i am very choosey in regard to homes and i reject threefourths of those that offer
later
gordon has made honorable amends to my children
his bag of peanuts is here made of burlap and three feet high
do you remember the dessert of peanuts and maple sugar they used to give us at college
we turned up our noses but ate
i am instituting it here and i assure you we don't turn up our noses
it is a pleasure to feed children who have graduated from a course of mrs lippett they are pathetically grateful for small blessings
you can't complain that this letter is too short
yours  on the verge of writer's cramp  s mcb
the john grier home  off and on all day friday
dear judy  you will be interested to hear that i have encountered another enemythe doctor's housekeeper
i had talked to the creature several times over the telephone and had noted that her voice was not distinguished by the soft low accents that mark the caste of vere de vere but now i have seen her
this morning while returning from the village i made a slight detour and passed our doctor's house
sandy is evidently the result of environmentolive green with a mansard roof and the shades pulled down
you would think he had just been holding a funeral
i don't wonder that the amenities of life have somewhat escaped the poor man
after studying the outside of his house i was filled with curiosity to see if the inside matched
having sneezed five times before breakfast this morning i decided to go in and consult him professionally
to be sure he is a children's specialist but sneezes are common to all ages
so i boldly marched up the steps and rang the bell
hark
what sound is that that breaks upon our revelry
the hon
cy's voice as i live approaching up the stairs
i've letters to write and i can't be tormented by his blether so i am rushing jane to the door with orders to look him firmly in the eye and tell him i am out
         on with the dance
let joy be unconfined
he's gone
but those eight stars represent eight agonizing minutes spent in the dark of my library closet
the hon
cy received jane's communication with the affable statement that he would sit down and wait
whereupon he entered and sat
but did jane leave me to languish in the closet
no she enticed him to the nursery to see the awful thing that sadie kate has done
the hon
cy loves to see awful things particularly when done by sadie kate
i haven't an idea what scandal jane is about to disclose but no matter he has gone
where was i
oh yes i had rung the doctor's bell
the door was opened by a large husky person with her sleeves rolled up
she looked very businesslike with a hawk's nose and cold gray eyes
well
said she her tone implying that i was a vacuumcleaning agent
good morning
i smiled affably and stepped inside
is this mrs
mcgurk
it is said she
an' ye'll be the new young woman in the orphan asylum
i am that said i
is himself at home
he is not said she
but this is his office hour
he don't keep it regular'
he ought said i sternly
kindly tell him that miss mcbride called to consult him and ask him to look in at the john grier home this afternoon

grunted mrs mcgurk and closed the door so promptly that she shut in the hem of my skirt
when i told the doctor this afternoon he shrugged his shoulders and observed that that was maggie's gracious way
and why do you put up with maggie
said i
and where would i find any one better
said he
doing the work for a lone man who comes as irregularly to meals as a twentyfourhour day will permit is no sinecure
she furnishes little sunshine in the home but she does manage to produce a hot dinner at nine o'clock at night
just the same i am willing to wager that her hot dinners are neither delicious nor well served
she's an inefficient lazy old termagant and i know why she doesn't like me
she imagines that i want to steal away the doctor and oust her from a comfortable position something of a joke considering
but i am not undeceiving her it will do the old thing good to worry a little
she may cook him better dinners and fatten him up a trifle
i understand that fat men are goodnatured
ten o'clock
i don't know what silly stuff i have been writing to you off and on all day between interruptions
it has got to be night at last and i am too tired to do so much as hold up my head
your song tells the sad truth there is no joy in life but sleep
i bid you good night

dear judy  i have placed out isador gutschneider
his new mother is a swedish woman fat and smiling with blue eyes and yellow hair
she chose him out of the whole nurseryful of children because he was the brunettest baby there
she has always loved brunettes but in her most ambitious dreams has never hoped to have one of her own
his name is going to be changed to oscar carlson after his new dead uncle
my first trustees' meeting is to occur next wednesday
i confess that i am not looking forward to it with impatienceespecially as an inaugural address by me will be its chief feature
i wish our president were here to back me up
but at least i am sure of one thing
i am never going to adopt the uriah heepish attitude toward trustees that characterized mrs lippett's manners
i shall treat first wednesdays as a pleasant social diversion my day at home when the friends of the asylum gather for discussion and relaxation and i shall endeavor not to let our pleasures discommode the orphans
you see how i have taken to heart the unhappy experiences of that little jerusha
your last letter has arrived and no suggestion in it of traveling north
isn't it about time that you were turning your faces back toward fifth avenue
hame is hame be 't ever sae hamely
don't you marvel at the scotch that flows so readily from my pen

i leave you to devote a revivifying halfhour to mutton hash

six o'clock
the hon
cy has been calling again
he drops in with great frequency hoping to catch me in delictu
how i do not like that man
he is a pink fat puffy old thing with a pink fat puffy soul
i was in a very cheery optimistic frame of mind before his arrival but now i shall do nothing but grumble for the rest of the day
he deplores all of the useless innovations that i am endeavoring to introduce such as a cheerful playroom prettier clothes baths and better food and fresh air and play and fun and icecream and kisses
he says that i will unfit these children to occupy the position in life that god has called them to occupy
at that my irish blood came to the surface and i told him that if god had planned to make all of these  little children into useless ignorant unhappy citizens i was going to fool god
that we weren't educating them out of their class in the least
we were educating them into their natural class much more effectually than is done in the average family
we weren't trying to force them into college if they hadn't any brains as happens with rich men's sons and we weren't putting them to work at fourteen if they were naturally ambitious as happens with poor men's sons
we were watching them closely and individually and discovering their level
if our children showed an aptitude to become farm laborers and nursemaids we were going to teach them to be the best possible farm laborers and nursemaids and if they showed a tendency to become lawyers we would turn them into honest intelligent openminded lawyers
he's a lawyer himself but certainly not an openminded one
he grunted when i had finished my remarks and stirred his tea vigorously
whereupon i suggested that perhaps he needed another lump of sugar and dropped it in and left him to absorb it
the only way to deal with trustees is with a firm and steady hand
you have to keep them in their places
oh my dear
that smudge in the corner was caused by singapore's black tongue

superintendent's office  john grier home  april 
the pendleton family  palm beach florida
dear sir and madam  i have weathered my first visitors' day and made the trustees a beautiful speech
everybody said it was a beautiful speecheven my enemies
mr gordon hallock's recent visit was exceptionally opportune i gleaned from him many suggestions as to how to carry an audience
be funny
i told about sadie kate and a few other cherubs that you don't know
keep it concrete and fitted to the intelligence of your audience
i watched the hon
cy and never said a thing that he couldn't understand
flatter your hearers
i hinted delicately that all of these new reforms were due to the wisdom and initiative of our peerless trustees
give it a high moral tone with a dash of pathos
i dwelt upon the parentless condition of these little wards of society
and it was very affectingmy enemy wiped away a tear
then i fed them up on chocolate and whipped cream and lemonade and tartar sandwiches and sent them home expansive and beaming but without any appetite for dinner
i dwell thus at length upon our triumph in order to create in you a happy frame of mind before passing to the higeous calamity that so nearly wrecked the occasion
now follows the dim horror of my tale      and i feel i'm growing gradually pale           for even at this day           though its smell has passed away      when i venture to remember it i quail
you never heard of our little tammas kehoe did you
i simply haven't featured tammas because he requires so much ink and time and vocabulary
he's a spirited lad and he follows his dad a mighty hunter of oldthat sounds like more bab ballads but it isn't i made it up as i went along
we can't break tammas of his inherited predatory instincts
he shoots the chickens with bows and arrows and lassoes the pigs and plays bullfight with the cowsand oh is very destructive
but his crowning villainy occurred an hour before the trustees' meeting when we wanted to be so clean and sweet and engaging
it seems that he had stolen the rat trap from the oat bin and had set it up in the wood lot and yesterday morning was so fortunate as to catch a fine big skunk
singapore was the first to report the discovery
he returned to the house and rolled on the rugs in a frenzy of remorse over his part of the business
while our attention was occupied with sing tammas was busily skinning his prey in the seclusion of the woodshed
he buttoned the pelt inside his jacket conveyed it by a devious route through the length of this building and concealed it under his bed where he thought it wouldn't be found
then he wentper scheduleto the basement to help freeze the icecream for our guests
you notice that we omitted icecream from the menu
in the short time that remained we created all the counterirritation that was possible
noah negro furnace man started smudge fires at intervals about the grounds
cook waved a shovelful of burning coffee through the house
betsy sprinkled the corridors with ammonia
miss snaith daintily treated the rugs with violet water
i sent an emergency call to the doctor who came and mixed a gigantic solution of chlorid of lime
but still above and beneath and through every other odor the unlaid ghost of tammas's victim cried for vengeance
the first business that came up at the meeting was whether we should dig a hole and bury not only tammas but the whole main building
you can see with what finesse i carried off the shocking event when i tell you that the hon
cy went home chuckling over a funny story instead of grumbling at the new superintendent's inability to manage boys
we've our ain bit weird to dree

the john grier home  friday likewise saturday
dear judy  singapore is still living in the carriage house and receiving a daily carbolicscented bath from tammas kehoe
i am hoping that some day in the distant future my darling will be fit to return
you will be pleased to hear that i have instituted a new method of spending your money
we are henceforth to buy a part of our shoes and drygoods and drug store comestibles from local shops at not quite such low prices as the wholesale jobbers give but still at a discount and the education that is being thrown in is worth the difference
the reason is this i have made the discovery that half of my children know nothing of money or its purchasing power
they think that shoes and corn meal and redflannel petticoats and mutton stew and gingham shirts just float down from the blue sky
last week i dropped a new green dollar bill out of my purse and an eightyearold urchin picked it up and asked if he could keep that picture of a bird
american eagle in the center
that child had never seen a bill in his life
i began an investigation and discovered that dozens of children in this asylum have never bought anything or have ever seen anybody buy anything
and we are planning to turn them out at sixteen into a world governed entirely by the purchasing power of dollars and cents
good heavens
just think of it
they are not to lead sheltered lives with somebody eternally looking after them they have got to know how to get the very most they can out of every penny they can manage to earn
i pondered the question all one night at intervals and went to the village at nine o'clock the next morning
i held conferences with seven storekeepers found four openminded and helpful two doubtful and one actively stupid
i have started with the fourdrygoods groceries shoes and stationery
in return for somewhat large orders from us they are to turn themselves and their clerks into teachers for my children who are to go to the stores inspect the stocks and do their own purchasing with real money
for example jane needs a spool of blue sewingsilk and a yard of elastic so two little girls intrusted with a silver quarter trot hand in hand to mr meeker's
they match the silk with anxious care and watch the clerk jealously while he measures the elastic to make sure that he doesn't stretch it
then they bring back six cents change receive my thanks and praise and retire to the ranks tingling with a sense of achievement
isn't it pathetic
ordinary children of ten or twelve automatically know so many things that our little incubator chicks have never dreamed of
but i have a variety of plans on foot
just give me time and you will see
one of these days i'll be turning out some nearly normal youngsters
later
i've an empty evening ahead so i'll settle to some further gossip with you
you remember the peanuts that gordon hallock sent
well i was so gracious when i thanked him that it incited him to fresh effort
he apparently went into a toy shop and placed himself unreservedly in the hands of an enterprising clerk
yesterday two husky expressmen deposited in our front hall a crate full of expensive furry animals built to be consumed by the children of the rich
they are not exactly what i should have purchased had i been the one to disburse such a fortune but my babies find them very huggable
the chicks are now taking to bed with them lions and elephants and bears and giraffes
i don't know what the psychological effect will be
do you suppose when they grow up they will all join the circus
oh dear me here is miss snaith coming to pay a social call
goodby

the john grier home  april 
my dear judy  i have just been reading a pamphlet on manual training for girls and another on the proper diet for institutionsright proportions of proteins fats starches etc
in these days of scientific charity when every problem has been tabulated you can run an institution by chart
i don't see how mrs lippett could have made all the mistakes she did assuming of coursethat she knew how to read
but there is one quite important branch of institutional work that has not been touched upon and i myself am gathering data
some day i shall issue a pamphlet on the management and control of trustees
i must tell you the joke about my enemynot the hon
cy but my first my original enemy
he has undertaken a new field of endeavor
he says quite soberly everything he does is sober he has never smiled yet that he has been watching me closely since my arrival and though i am untrained and foolish and flippant sic he doesn't think that i am really so superficial as i at first appeared
i have an almost masculine ability of grasping the whole of a question and going straight to the point
aren't men funny
when they want to pay you the greatest compliment in their power they naively tell you that you have a masculine mind
there is one compliment incidentally that i shall never be paying him
i cannot honestly say that he has a quickness of perception almost feminine
so though sandy quite plainly sees my faults still he thinks that some of them may be corrected and he has determined to carry on my education from the point where the college dropped it
a person in my position ought to be well read in physiology biology psychology sociology and eugenics she should know the hereditary effects of insanity idiocy and alcohol should be able to administer the binet test and should understand the nervous system of a frog
in pursuance whereof he has placed at my disposal his own scientific library of four thousand volumes
he not only fetches in the books he wants me to read but comes and asks questions to make sure i haven't skipped
we devoted last week to the life and letters of the jukes family
margaret the mother of criminals six generations ago founded a prolific line and her progeny mostly in jail now numbers some twelve hundred
moral watch the children with a bad heredity so carefully that none of them can ever have any excuse for growing up into jukeses
so now as soon as we have finished our tea sandy and i get out the doomsday book and pore over its pages in an anxious search for alcoholic parents
it's a cheerful little game to while away the twilight hour after the day's work is done
quelle vie
come home fast and take me out of it
i'm wearying for the sight of you

j g h  thursday morning
my dear pendleton family  i have received your letter and i seize my pen to stop you
i don't wish to be relieved
i take it back
i change my mind
the person you are planning to send sounds like an exact twin of miss snaith
how can you ask me to turn over my darling children to a kind but ineffectual middleaged lady without any chin
the very thought of it wrings a mother's heart
do you imagine that such a woman can carry on this work even temporarily
no
the manager of an institution like this has got to be young and husky and energetic and forceful and efficient and redhaired and sweettempered like me
of course i've been discontentedanybody would be with things in such a messbut it's what you socialists call a holy discontent
and do you think that i am going to abandon all of the beautiful reforms i have so painstakingly started
no
i am not to be moved from this spot until you find a superintendent superior to sallie mcbride
that does not mean though that i am mortgaging myself forever
just for the present until things get on their feet
while the face washing airing reconstructing period lasts i honestly believe you chose the right person when you hit upon me
i love to plan improvements and order people about
this is an awfully messy letter but i'm dashing it off in three minutes in order to catch you before you definitely engage that pleasant inefficient middleaged person without a chin
please kind lady and gentleman don't do me out of me job
let me stay a few months longer
just gimme a chance to show what i'm good for and i promise you won't never regret it

dear judy  i've composed a poema paean of victory
robin macrae smiled today
it's the truth
s mcb
the john grier home  april 
dear judy  i am gratified to learn that you were gratified to learn that i am going to stay
i hadn't realized it but i am really getting sort of attached to orphans
it's an awful disappointment that jervis has business which will keep you south so much longer
i am bursting with talk and it is such a laborious nuisance having to write everything i want to say
of course i am glad that we are to have the building remodeled and i think all of your ideas good but i have a few extra good ones myself
it will be nice to have the new gymnasium and sleepingporches but oh my soul does long for cottages
the more i look into the internal workings of an orphan asylum the more i realize that the only type of asylum that can compete with a private family is one on the cottage system
so long as the family is the unit of society children should be hardened early to family life
the problem that is keeping me awake at present is what to do with the children while we are being made over
it is hard to live in a house and build it at the same time
how would it be if i rented a circus tent and pitched it on the lawn
also when we plunge into our alterations i want a few guest rooms where our children can come back when ill or out of work
the great secret of our lasting influence in their lives will be our watchful care afterward
what a terrible alone feeling it must give a person not to have a family hovering in the background
with all my dozens of aunts and uncles and mothers and fathers and cousins and brothers and sisters i can't visualize it
i'd be terrified and panting if i didn't have lots of cover to run to
and for these forlorn little mites somehow or other the john grier home must supply their need
so dear people send me half a dozen guest rooms if you please
goodby and i'm glad you didn't put in the other woman
the very suggestion of somebody else taking over my own beautiful reforms before they were even started stirred up all the opposition in me
i'm afraid i'm like sandyi canna think aught is dune richt except my ain hand is in 't
yours for the present  sallie mcbride
the john grier home  sunday
dear gordon  i know that i haven't written lately you have a perfect right to grumble but oh dear
oh dear
you can't imagine what a busy person an orphan asylum superintendent is
and all the writing energy i possess has to be expended upon that voracious judy abbott pendleton
if three days go by without a letter she telegraphs to know if the asylum has burned whereas if younice mango letterless you simply send us a present to remind us of your existence
so you see it's distinctly to our advantage to slight you often
you will probably be annoyed when i tell you that i have promised to stay on here
they finally did find a woman to take my place but she wasn't at all the right type and would have answered only temporarily
and my dear gordon it's true when i faced saying goodby to this feverish planning and activity worcester somehow looked rather colorless
i couldn't bear to let my asylum go unless i was sure of substituting a life packed equally full of sensation
i know the alternative you will suggest but please don'tjust now
i told you before that i must have a few months longer to make up my mind
and in the meantime i like the feeling that i'm of use in the world
there's something constructive and optimistic about working with children that is if you look at it from my cheerful point of view and not from our scotch doctor's
i've never seen anybody like that man he's always pessimistic and morbid and down
it's best not to be too intelligent about insanity and dipsomania and all the other hereditary details
i am just about ignorant enough to be lighthearted and effective in a place like this
the thought of all of these little lives expanding in every direction eternally thrills me
there are so many possibilities in our child garden for every kind of flower
it has been planted rather promiscuously to be sure but though we undoubtedly shall gather a number of weeds we are also hoping for some rare and beautiful blossoms
am i not growing sentimental
it is due to hungerand there goes the dinnergong
we are going to have a delicious meal roast beef and creamed carrots and beet greens with rhubarb pie for dessert
would you not like to dine with me
i should love to have you
most cordially yours  s mcb
ps
you should see the number of poor homeless cats that these children want to adopt
we had four when i came and they have all had kittens since
i haven't taken an exact census but i think the institution possesses nineteen

my dear judy  you'd like to make another slight donation to the j g h out of the excess of last month's allowance
bene
will you kindly have the following inserted in all lowclass metropolitan dailies                  notice
to parents planning to abandon their children      please do it before they have reached their third year
i can't think of any action on the part of abandoning parents that would help us more effectually
this having to root up evil before you begin planting good is slow discouraging work
we have one child here who has almost floored me but i will not acknowledge myself beaten by a child of five
he alternates between sullen moroseness when he won't speak a word and the most violent outbursts of temper when he smashes everything within reach
he has been here only three months and in that time he has destroyed nearly every piece of bricabrac in the institutionnot by the way a great loss to art
a month or so before i came he pulled the tablecloth from the officers' table while the girl in charge was in the corridor sounding the gong
the soup had already been served
you can imagine the mess
mrs lippett half killed the child on that occasion but the killing did nothing to lessen the temper which was handed on to me intact
his father was italian and his mother irish he has red hair and freckles from county cork and the most beautiful brown eyes that ever came out of naples
after the father was stabbed in a fight and the mother had died of alcoholism the poor little chap by some chance or other got to us
i suspect that he belongs in the catholic protectory
as for his mannersoh dear
oh dear
they are what you would expect
he kicks and bites and swears
i have dubbed him punch
yesterday he was brought squirming and howling to my office charged with having knocked down a little girl and robbed her of her doll
miss snaith plumped him into a chair behind me and left him to grow quiet while i went on with my writing
i was suddenly startled by an awful crash
he had pushed that big green jardiniere off the windowsill and broken it into five hundred pieces
i jumped with a suddenness that swept the inkbottle to the floor and when punch saw that second catastrophe he stopped roaring with rage and threw back his head and roared with laughter
the child is diabolical
i have determined to try a new method of discipline that i don't believe in the whole of his forlorn little life he has ever experienced
i am going to see what praise and encouragement and love will do
so instead of scolding him about the jardiniere i assumed that it was an accident
i kissed him and told him not to feel bad that i didn't mind in the least
it shocked him into being quiet he simply held his breath and stared while i wiped away his tears and sopped up the ink
the child just now is the biggest problem that the j g h affords
he needs the most patient loving individual carea proper mother and father likewise some brothers and sisters and a grandmother
but i can't place him in a respectable family until i make over his language and his propensity to break things
i separated him from the other children and kept him in my room all the morning jane having removed to safe heights all destructible objets d'art
fortunately he loves to draw and he sat on a rug for two hours and occupied himself with colored pencils
he was so surprised when i showed an interest in a redandgreen ferryboat with a yellow flag floating from the mast that he became quite profanely affable
until then i couldn't get a word out of him
in the afternoon dr macrae dropped in and admired the ferryboat while punch swelled with the pride of creation
then as a reward for being such a good little boy the doctor took him out in his automobile on a visit to a country patient
punch was restored to the fold at five o'clock by a sadder and wiser doctor
at a sedate country estate he had stoned the chickens smashed a cold frame and swung the pet angora cat by its tail
then when the sweet old lady tried to make him be kind to poor pussy he told her to go to hell
i can't bear to consider what some of these children have seen and experienced
it will take years of sunshine and happiness and love to eradicate the dreadful memories that they have stored up in the farback corners of their little brains
and there are so many children and so few of us that we can't hug them enough we simply haven't arms or laps to go around
mais parlons d'autres choses
those awful questions of heredity and environment that the doctor broods over so constantly are getting into my blood too and it's a vicious habit
if a person is to be of any use in a place like this she must see nothing but good in the world
optimism is the only wear for a social worker
'tis the middle of night by the castle clockdo you know where that beautiful line of poetry comes from
cristabel of english k mercy
how i hated that course
you being an english shark liked it but i never understood a word that was said from the time i entered the classroom till i left it
however the remark with which i opened this paragraph is true
it is the middle of night by the mantelpiece clock so i'll wish you pleasant dreams

dear enemy  you doctored the whole house then stalked past my library with your nose in the air while i was waiting tea with a plate of scotch scones sitting on the trivet ordered expressly for you as a peaceoffering
if you are really hurt i will read the kallikak book but i must tell you that you are working me to death
it takes almost all of my energy to be an effective superintendent and this university extension course that you are conducting i find wearing
you remember how indignant you were one day last week because i confessed to having stayed up until one o'clock the night before
well my dear man if i were to accomplish all the vicarious reading you require i should sit up until morning every night
however bring it in
i usually manage half an hour of recreation after dinner and though i had wanted to glance at wells's latest novel i will amuse myself instead with your feebleminded family
life of late is unco steep
obligingly yours  s mcb
the john grier home  april 
dear gordon  thank you for the tulips likewise the lilies of the valley
they are most becoming to my blue persian bowls
have you ever heard of the kallikaks
get the book and read them up
they are a twobranch family in new jersey i think though their real name and origin is artfully concealed
but anywayand this is truesix generations ago a young gentleman called for convenience martin kallikak got drunk one night and temporarily eloped with a feebleminded barmaid thus founding a long line of feebleminded kallikaksdrunkards gamblers prostitutes horse thievesa scourge to new jersey and surrounding states
martin later straightened up married a normal woman and founded a second line of proper kallikaksjudges doctors farmers professors politiciansa credit to their country
and there the two branches still are flourishing side by side
you can see what a blessing it would have been to new jersey if something drastic had happened to that feebleminded barmaid in her infancy
it seems that feeblemindedness is a very hereditary quality and science isn't able to overcome it
no operation has been discovered for introducing brains into the head of a child who didn't start with them
and the child grows up with say a nineyear brain in a thirtyyear body and becomes an easy tool for any criminal he meets
our prisons are onethird full of feebleminded convicts
society ought to segregate them on feebleminded farms where they can earn their livings in peaceful menial pursuits and not have children
then in a generation or so we might be able to wipe them out
did you know all that
it's very necessary information for a politician to have
get the book and read it please i'd send my copy only that it's borrowed
it's also very necessary information for me to have
there are eleven of these chicks that i suspect a bit and i am sure of loretta higgins
i have been trying for a month to introduce one or two basic ideas into that child's brain and now i know what the trouble is her head is filled with a sort of soft cheesy substance instead of brain
i came up here to make over this asylum in such little details as fresh air and food and clothes and sunshine but heavens
you can see what problems i am facing
i've got to make over society first so that it won't send me subnormal children to work with
excuse all this excited conversation but i've just met up with the subject of feeblemindedness and it's appallingand interesting
it is your business as a legislator to make laws that will remove it from the world
please attend to this immediately and oblige  s mcbride  sup't john grier home
friday
dear man of science  you didn't come today
please don't skip us tomorrow
i have finished the kallikak family and i am bursting with talk
don't you think we ought to have a psychologist examine these children
we owe it to adopting parents not to saddle them with feebleminded offspring
you know i'm tempted to ask you to prescribe arsenic for loretta's cold
i've diagnosed her case she's a kallikak
is it right to let her grow up and found a line of  feebleminded people for society to care for
oh dear
i do hate to poison the child but what can i do
s mcb
dear gordon  you aren't interested in feebleminded people and you are shocked because i am
well i am equally shocked because you are not
if you aren't interested in everything of the sort that there unfortunately is in this world how can you make wise laws
you can't
however at your request i will converse upon a less morbid subject
i've just bought fifty yards of blue and rose and green and corncolored hairribbon as an easter present for my fifty little daughters
i am also thinking of sending you an easter present
how would a nice fluffy little kitten please you
i can offer any of the following patterns   number  comes in any color gray black or yellow
if you will let me know which you would rather have i will express it at once
i would write a respectable letter but it's teatime and i see that a guest approaches

my dear judy  one a penny two a penny hot cross buns
we've had a good friday present of ten dozen given by mrs de peyster lambert a high church stainedglasswindow soul whom i met at a tea a few days ago
who says now that teas are a silly waste of time
she asked me about my precious little waifs and said i was doing a noble work and would be rewarded
i saw buns in her eye and sat down and talked to her for half an hour
now i shall go and thank her in person and tell her with a great deal of affecting detail how much those buns were appreciated by my precious little waifsomitting the account of how precious little punch threw his bun at miss snaith and plastered her neatly in the eye
i think with encouragement mrs de peyster lambert can be developed into a cheerful giver
oh i'm growing into the most shocking beggar
my family don't dare to visit me because i demand bakshish in such a brazen manner
i threatened to remove father from my calling list unless he shipped immediately sixtyfive pairs of overalls for my prospective gardeners
a notice from the freight office this morning asks me to remove two packing cases consigned to them by the j l mcbride co of worcester so i take it that father desires to continue my acquaintance
jimmie hasn't sent us anything yet and he's getting a huge salary
i write him frequently a pathetic list of our needs
but gordon hallock has learned the way to a mother's heart
i was so pleasant about the peanuts and menagerie that now he sends a present of some sort every few days and i spend my entire time composing thankyou letters that aren't exact copies of the ones i've sent before
last week we received a dozen big scarlet balls
the nursery is full of them you kick them before you as you walk
and yesterday there arrived a halfbushel of frogs and ducks and fishes to float in the bathtubs

my dear judy  spring must be lurking about somewhere the birds are arriving from the south
isn't it time you followed their example
society note from the bird o' passage news  mr and mrs first robin have returned from a trip to florida
it is hoped that mr and mrs jervis pendleton will arrive shortly
even up here in our dilatory dutchess county the breeze smells green
it makes you want to be out and away roaming the hills or else down on your knees grubbing in the dirt
isn't it funny what farmering instincts the budding spring awakens in even the most urban souls
i have spent the morning making plans for little private gardens for every child over nine
the big potato field is doomed
that is the only feasible spot for sixtytwo private gardens
it is near enough to be watched from the north windows and yet far enough away so that their messing will not injure our highly prized landscape lawn
also the earth is rich and they have some chance of success
i don't want the poor little chicks to scratch all summer and then not turn up any treasure in the end
in order to furnish an incentive i shall announce that the institution will buy their produce and pay in real money though i foresee we shall be buried under a mountain of radishes
i do so want to develop selfreliance and initiative in these children two sturdy qualities in which they are conspicuously lacking with the exception of sadie kate and a few other bad ones
children who have spirit enough to be bad i consider very hopeful
it's those who are good just from inertia that are discouraging
the last few days have been spent mainly in charming the devil out of punch an interesting task if i could devote my whole time to it
but with one hundred and seven other little devils to charm away my attention is sorely deflected
the awful thing about this life is that whatever i am doing the other things that i am not doing but ought to be keep tugging at my skirts
there is no doubt but punch's personal devil needs the whole attention of a whole personpreferably two personsso that they could spell each other and get some rest
sadie kate has just flown in from the nursery with news of a scarlet goldfish gordon's gift swallowed by one of our babies
mercy
the number of calamities that can occur in an orphan asylum
 pm   my children are in bed and i've just had a thought
wouldn't it be heavenly if the hibernating system prevailed among the human young
there would be some pleasure in running an asylum if one could just tuck the little darlings into bed the first of october and keep them there until the twentysecond of april
i'm yours as ever  sallie

dear jervis pendleton esq
  this is to supplement a night telegram which i sent you ten minutes ago
fifty words not being enough to convey any idea of my emotions i herewith add a thousand
as you will know by the time you receive this i have discharged the farmer and he has refused to be discharged
being twice the size of me i can't lug him to the gate and chuck him out
he wants a notification from the president of the board of trustees written in vigorous language on official paper in typewriting
so dear president of the board of trustees kindly supply all of this at your earliest convenience
here follows the history of the case  the winter season still being with us when i arrived and farming activities at a low ebb i have heretofore paid little attention to robert sterry except to note on two occasions that his pigpens needed cleaning but today i sent for him to come and consult with me in regard to spring planting
sterry came as requested and seated himself at ease in my office with his hat upon his head
i suggested as tactfully as might be that he remove it an entirely necessary request as little orphan boys were in and out on errands and hats off in the house is our first rule in masculine deportment
sterry complied with my request and stiffened himself to be against whatever i might desire
i proceeded to the subject in hand namely that the diet of the john grier home in the year to come is to consist less exclusively of potatoes
at which our farmer grunted in the manner of the hon
cyrus wykoff only it was a less ethereal and gentlemanly grunt than a trustee permits himself
i enumerated corn and beans and onions and peas and tomatoes and beets and carrots and turnips as desirable substitutes
sterry observed that if potatoes and cabbages was good enough for him he guessed they was good enough for charity children
i proceeded imperturbably to say that the twoacre potato field was to be plowed and fertilized and laid out into sixty individual gardens the boys assisting in the work
at that sterry exploded
the twoacre field was the most fertile and valuable piece of earth on the whole place
he guessed if i was to break that up into play gardens for the children to mess about in i'd be hearing about it pretty danged quick from the board of trustees
that field was fitted for potatoes it had always raised potatoes and it was going to continue to raise them just as long as he had anything to say about it
you have nothing whatever to say about it i amiably replied
i have decided that the twoacre field is the best plot to use for the children's gardens and you and the potatoes will have to give way
whereupon he rose in a storm of bucolic wrath and said he'd be gol darned if he'd have a lot of these danged city brats interfering with his work
i explainedvery calmly for a redhaired person with irish forebearsthat this place was run for the exclusive benefit of these children that the children were not here to be exploited for the benefit of the place a philosophy which he did not grasp though my fancy city language had a slightly dampening effect
i added that what i required in a farmer was the ability and patience to instruct the boys in gardening and simple outdoor work that i wished a man of large sympathies whose example would be an inspiring influence to these children of the city streets
sterry pacing about like a caged woodchuck launched into a tirade about silly sundayschool notions and by a transition which i did not grasp passed to a review of the general subject of woman's suffrage
i gathered that he is not in favor of the movement
i let him argue himself quiet then i handed him a check for his wages and told him to vacate the tenant house by twelve o'clock next wednesday
sterry says he'll be danged if he will
excuse so many dangeds
it is the creature's only adjective
he was engaged to work for this institution by the president of the board of trustees and he will not move from that house until the president of the board of trustees tells him to go
i don't think poor sterry realizes that since his arrival a new president has come to the throne
alors you have the story
i make no threats but sterry or mcbridetake your choice dear sir
i am also about to write to the head of the massachusetts agricultural college at amherst asking him to recommend a good practical man with a nice efficient cheerful wife who will take the entire care of our modest domain of seventeen acres and who will be a man with the right personality to place over our boys
if we get the farming end of this institution into running shape it ought to furnish not only beans and onions for the table but education for our hands and brains
i remain sir yours most truly s mcbride superintendent of the john grier home
ps
i think that sterry will probably come back some night and throw rocks through the windows
shall i have them insured
my dear enemy  you disappeared so quickly this afternoon that i had no chance to thank you but the echoes of that discharge penetrated as far as my library
also i have viewed the debris
what on earth did you do to poor sterry
watching the purposeful set of your shoulders as you strode toward the carriage house i was filled with sudden compunction
i did not want the man murdered merely reasoned with
i am afraid you were a little harsh
however your technic seems to have been effective
report says that he has telephoned for a moving wagon and that mrs sterry is even now on her hands and knees ripping up the parlor carpet
for this relief much thanks
sallie mcbride
april 
dear jervis  your vigorous telegram was after all not needed
dr robin macrae who is a grand pawky mon when it comes to a fight accomplished the business with beautiful directness
i was so bubbling with rage that immediately after writing to you i called up the doctor on the telephone and rehearsed the whole business over again
now our sandy whatever his failings and he has them does have an uncommon supply of common sense
he knows how useful those gardens are going to be and how worse than useless sterry was
also says he the superintendent's authority must be upheld
that incidentally is beautiful coming from him
but anyway those were his words
and he hung up the receiver cranked up his car and flew up here at lawless speed
he marched straight to sterry impelled by a fine scotch rage and he discharged the man with such vigor and precision that the carriage house window was shattered to fragments
since this morning at eleven when sterry's wagonload of furniture rumbled out of the gates a sweet peace has reigned over the j g h a man from the village is helping us out while we hopefully await the farmer of our dreams
i am sorry to have troubled you with our troubles
tell judy that she owes me a letter and won't hear from me until she has paid it
your ob'd't servant  s mcbride
dear judy  in my letter of yesterday to jervis i forgotted punch's word to convey to you our thanks for three tin bathtubs
the skyblue tub with poppies on the side adds a particularly bright note to the nursery
i do love presents for the babies that are too big to be swallowed
you will be pleased to hear that our manual training is well under way
the carpenter benches are being installed in the old primary room and until our schoolhouse gets its new addition our primary class is meeting on the front porch in accordance with miss matthew's able suggestion
the girls' sewing classes are also in progress
a circle of benches under the copper beech tree accommodates the hand sewers while the big girls take turns at our three machines
just as soon as they gain some proficiency we will begin the glorious work of redressing the institution
i know you think i'm slow but it's really a task to accomplish one hundred and eighty new frocks
and the girls will appreciate them so much more if they do the work themselves
i may also report that our hygiene system has risen to a high level
dr macrae has introduced morning and evening exercises and a glass of milk and a game of tag in the middle of school hours
he has instituted a physiology class and has separated the children into small groups so that they may come to his house where he has a manikin that comes apart and shows all its messy insides
they can now rattle off scientific truths about their little digestions as fluently as mother goose rhymes
we are really becoming too intelligent for recognition
you would never guess that we were orphans to hear us talk we are quite like boston children
 pm   o judy such a calamity
do you remember several weeks ago i told you about placing out a nice little girl in a nice family home where i hoped she would be adopted
it was a kind christian family living in a pleasant country village the fosterfather a deacon in the church
hattie was a sweet obedient housewifely little body and it looked as though we had exactly fitted them to each other
my dear she was returned this morning for stealing
scandal piled on scandal she had stolen a communion cup from church
between her sobs and their accusations it took me half an hour to gather the truth
it seems that the church they attend is very modern and hygienic like our doctor and has introduced individual communion cups
poor little hattie had never heard of communion in her life
in fact she wasn't very used to church sundayschool having always sufficed for her simple religious needs
but in her new home she attended both and one day to her pleased surprise they served refreshments
but they skipped her
she made no comment however she is used to being skipped
but as they were starting home she saw that the little silver cup had been casually left in the seat and supposing that it was a souvenir that you could take if you wished she put it into her pocket
it came to light two days later as the most treasured ornament of her doll'shouse
it seems that hattie long ago saw a set of doll's dishes in a toy shop window and has ever since dreamed of possessing a set of her own
the communion cup was not quite the same but it answered
now if our family had only had a little less religion and a little more sense they would have returned the cup perfectly unharmed and have marched hattie to the nearest toy shop and bought her some dishes
but instead they bundled the child and her belongings into the first train they could catch and shoved her in at our front door proclaiming loudly that she was a thief
i am pleased to say that i gave that indignant deacon and his wife such a thorough scolding as i am sure they have never listened to from the pulpit
i borrowed some vigorous bits from sandy's vocabulary and sent them home quite humbled
as for poor little hattie here she is back again after going out with such high hopes
it has an awfully bad moral effect on a child to be returned to the asylum in disgrace especially when she wasn't aware of committing a crime
it gives her a feeling that the world is full of unknown pitfalls and makes her afraid to take a step
i must bend all my energies now toward finding another set of parents for her and ones that haven't grown so old and settled and good that they have entirely forgotten their own childhood
sunday
i forgot to tell you that our new farmer is here turnfelt by name and his wife is a love yellow hair and dimples
if she were an orphan i could place her in a minute
we can't let her go to waste
i have a beautiful plan of building an addition to the farmer's cottage and establishing under her comfortable care a sort of broodinghouse where we can place our new little chicks to make sure they haven't anything contagious and to eliminate as much profanity as possible before turning them loose among our other perfect chicks
how does that strike you
it is very necessary in an institution as full of noise and movement and stir as this to have some isolated spot where we can put cases needing individual attention
some of our children have inherited nerves and a period of quiet contemplation is indicated
isn't my vocabulary professional and scientific
daily intercourse with dr robin macrae is extremely educational
since turnfelt came you should see our pigs
they are so clean and pink and unnatural that they don't recognize one another any more as they pass
our potato field is also unrecognizable
it has been divided with string and pegs into as many squares as a checkerboard and every child has staked out a claim
seed catalogues form our only reading matter
noah has just returned from a trip to the village for the sunday papers to amuse his leisure
noah is a very cultivated person he not only reads perfectly but he wears tortoiseshellrimmed spectacles while he does it
he also brought from the post office a letter from you written friday night
i am pained to note that you do not care for gosta berling and that jervis doesn't
the only comment i can make is what a shocking lack of literary taste in the pendleton family
dr macrae has another doctor visiting him a very melancholy gentleman who is at the head of a private psychopathic institution and thinks there's no good in life
but i suppose this pessimistic view is natural if you eat three meals a day with a tableful of melancholics
he goes up and down the world looking for signs of degeneracy and finds them everywhere
i expected after half an hour's conversation that he would ask to look down my throat to see if i had a cleft palate
sandy's taste in friends seems to resemble his taste in literature
gracious
this is a letter
goodby
sallie
thursday may 
dear judy  such a bewildering whirl of events
the j g h is breathless
incidentally i am on the way toward solving my problem of what to do with the children while the carpenters and plumbers and masons are here
or rather my precious brother has solved it for me
this afternoon i went over my linen supply and made the shocking discovery that we have only sheets enough to change the children's beds every two weeks which it appears is our shiftless custom
while i was still in the midst of my household gear with a bunch of keys at my girdle looking like the chatelaine of a medieval chateau who should be ushered in but jimmie
being extremely occupied i dropped a slanting kiss on his nose and sent him off to look over the place in charge of my two oldest urchins
they collected six friends and organized a baseball game
jimmie came back blown but enthusiastic and consented to prolong his visit over the week end though after the dinner i gave him he has decided to take his future meals at the hotel
as we sat with our coffee before the fire i confided to him my anxiety as to what should be done with the chicks while their new brooder is building
you know jimmie
in one half a minute his plan was formulated
build an adirondack camp on that little plateau up by the wood lot
you can make three open shacks each holding eight bunks and move the twentyfour oldest boys out there for the summer
it won't cost two cents
yes i objected but it will cost more than two cents to engage a man to look after them
perfectly easy said jimmie grandly
i'll find you a college fellow who'll be glad to come during the vacation for his board and a mere pittance only you'll have to set up more filling board than you gave me tonight
dr macrae dropped in about nine o'clock after visiting the hospital ward
we've got three cases of whooping cough but all isolated and no more coming
how those three got in is a mystery
it seems there is a little bird that brings whooping cough to orphan asylums
jimmie fell upon him for backing in his camp scheme and the doctor gave it enthusiastically
they seized pencil and paper and drew up plans
and before the evening was over the last nail was hammered
nothing would satisfy those two men but to go to the telephone at ten o'clock and rouse a poor carpenter from his sleep
he and some lumber are ordered for eight in the morning
i finally got rid of them at tenthirty still talking uprights and joists and drainage and roof slants
the excitement of jimmie and coffee and all these building operations induced me to sit down immediately and write a letter to you but i think by your leave i'll postpone further details to another time
yours ever  sallie
saturday
dear enemy  will you be after dining with us at seven tonight
it's a real dinner party we're going to have icecream
my brother has discovered a promising young man to take charge of the boysmaybe you know himmr witherspoon at the bank
i wish to introduce him to asylum circles by easy steps so please don't mention insanity or epilepsy or alcoholism or any of your other favorite topics
he is a gay young society leader used to very fancy things to eat
do you suppose we can ever make him happy at the john grier home
yours in evident haste  sallie mcbride
sunday
dear judy  jimmie was back at eight friday morning and the doctor at a quarter past
they and the carpenter and our new farmer and noah and our two horses and our eight biggest boys have been working ever since
never were building operations set going in faster time
i wish i had a dozen jimmies on the place though i will say that my brother works faster if you catch him before the first edge of his enthusiasm wears away
he would not be much good at chiseling out a medieval cathedral
he came back saturday morning aglow with a new idea
he had met at the hotel the night before a friend who belongs to his hunting club in canada and who is cashier of our first and only national bank
he's a bully good sport said jimmie and exactly the man you want to camp out with those kids and lick 'em into shape
he'll be willing to come for his board and forty dollars a month because he's engaged to a girl in detroit and wants to save
i told him the food was rotten but if he kicked enough you'd probably get a new cook
what's his name
said i with guarded interest
he's got a peach of a name
it's percy de forest witherspoon
i nearly had hysterics
imagine a percy de forest witherspoon in charge of those twentyfour wild little savages
but you know jimmie when he has an idea
he had already invited mr witherspoon to dine with me on saturday evening and had ordered oysters and squabs and icecream from the village caterer to help out my veal
it ended by my giving a very formal dinner party with miss matthews and betsy and the doctor included
i almost asked the hon
cy and miss snaith
ever since i have known those two i have felt that there ought to be a romance between them
never have i known two people who matched so perfectly
he's a widower with five children
don't you suppose it might be arranged
if he had a wife to take up his attention it might deflect him a little from us
i'd be getting rid of them both at one stroke
it's to be considered among our future improvements
anyway we had our dinner
and during the course of the evening my anxiety grew not as to whether percy would do for us but as to whether we should do for percy
if i searched the world over i never could find a young man more calculated to win the affection of those boys
you know just by looking at him that he does everything well at least everything vigorous
his literary and artistic accomplishments i suspect a bit but he rides and shoots and plays golf and football and sails a boat
he likes to sleep out of doors and he likes boys
he has always wanted to know some orphans often read about 'em in books he says but never met any face to face
percy does seem too good to be true
before they left jimmie and the doctor hunted up a lantern and in their evening clothes conducted mr witherspoon across a plowed field to inspect his future dwelling
and such a sunday as we passed
i had absolutely to forbid their carpentering
those men would have put in a full day quite irrespective of the damage done to one hundred and four little moral natures
as it is they have just stood and looked at those shacks and handled their hammers and thought about where they would drive the first nail tomorrow morning
the more i study men the more i realize that they are nothing in the world but boys grown too big to be spankable
i am awfully worried as to how to feed mr witherspoon
he looks as though he had a frightfully healthy appetite and he looks as though he couldn't swallow his dinner unless he had on evening clothes
i've made betsy send home for a trunkful of evening gowns in order to keep up our social standing
one thing is fortunate he takes his luncheon at the hotel and i hear their luncheons are very filling
tell jervis i am sorry he is not with us to drive a nail for the camp
here comes the hon
cy up the path
heaven save us
ever your unfortunate  s mcb
the john grier home  may 
dear judy  our camp is finished our energetic brother has gone and our twentyfour boys have passed two healthful nights in the open
the three barkcovered shacks add a pleasant rustic touch to the grounds
they are like those we used to have in the adirondacks closed on three sides and open in the front and one larger than the rest to allow a private pavilion for mr percy witherspoon
an adjacent hut less exposed to the weather affords extremely adequate bathing facilities consisting of a faucet in the wall and three wateringcans
each camp has a bath master who stands on a stool and sprinkles each little shiverer as he trots under
since our trustees won't give us enough bathtubs we have to use our wits
the three camps have organized into three tribes of indians each with a chief of its own to answer for its conduct mr witherspoon high chief of all and dr macrae the medicine man
they dedicated their lodges tuesday evening with appropriate tribal ceremonies
and though they politely invited me to attend i decided that it was a purely masculine affair so i declined to go but sent refreshments a very popular move
betsy and i walked as far as the baseball field in the course of the evening and caught a glimpse of the orgies
the braves were squatting in a circle about a big fire each decorated with a blanket from his bed and a rakish band of feathers
our chickens seem very scant as to tail but i have asked no unpleasant questions
the doctor with a navajo blanket about his shoulders was executing a war dance while jimmie and mr witherspoon beat on war drumstwo of our copper kettles now permanently dented
fancy sandy
it's the first youthful glimmer i have ever caught in the man
after ten o'clock when the braves were safely stowed for the night the three men came in and limply dropped into comfortable chairs in my library with the air of having made martyrs of themselves in the great cause of charity
but they did not deceive me
they originated all that tomfoolery for their own individual delectation
so far mr percy witherspoon appears fairly happy
he is presiding at one end of the officers' table under the special protection of betsy and i am told that he instills considerable life into that sedate assemblage
i have endeavored to run up their menu a trifle and he accepts what is put before him with a perfectly good appetite irrespective of the absence of such accustomed trifles as oysters and quail and softshell crabs
there was no sign of a private sitting room that i could put at this young man's disposal but he himself has solved the difficulty by proposing to occupy our new laboratory
so he spends his evenings with a book and a pipe comfortably stretched in the dentist's chair
there are not many society men who would be willing to spend their evenings so harmlessly
that girl in detroit is a lucky young thing
mercy
an automobile full of people has just arrived to look over the institution and betsy who usually does the honors not here
i fly
addio

friday
dear enemy  i hear that i missed a call today but jane delivered your message together with the genetic philosophy of education
she says that you will call in a few days for my opinion of the book
is it to be a written or an oral examination
and doesn't it ever occur to you that this education business is rather onesided
it often strikes me that dr robin macrae's mental attitude would also be the better for some slight refurbishing
i will promise to read your book provided you read one of mine
i am sending herewith the dolly dialogues and shall ask for an opinion in a day or so
it's uphill work making a scotch presbyterian frivolous but persistency accomplishes wonders
s mcb
may 
my dear dear judy  talk about floods in ohio
right here in dutchess county we are the consistency of a wet sponge
rain for five days and everything wrong with this institution
the babies have had croup and we have been up o' nights with them
cook has given notice and there's a dead rat in the walls
our three camps leaked and in the early dawn after the first cloudburst twentyfour bedraggled little indians wrapped in damp bedding came shivering to the door and begged for admission
since then every clothesline every stairrailing has been covered with wet and smelly blankets that steam but won't dry
mr percy de forest witherspoon has returned to the hotel to wait until the sun comes out
after being cooped up for four days with no exercise to speak of the children's badness is breaking out in red spots like the measles
betsy and i have thought of every form of active and innocent occupation that could be carried on in such a congested quarter as this blind man's buff and pillow fights and hideandgoseek gymnastics in the dining room and beanbags in the school room
we broke two windows
the boys played leapfrog up and down the hall and jarred all the plaster in the building
we have cleaned energetically and furiously
all the woodwork has been washed and all of the floors polished
but despite everything we have a great deal of energy left and we are getting to that point of nerves where we want to punch one another
sadie kate has been acting like a little deildo they have feminine deils
if not sadie kate has originated the species
and this afternoon loretta higgins hadwell i don't know whether it was a sort of fit or just a temper
she lay down on the floor and howled for a solid hour and when any one tried to approach her she thrashed about like a little windmill and bit and kicked
by the time the doctor came she had pretty well worn herself out
he picked her up limp and drooping and carried her to a cot in the hospital room and after she was asleep he came down to my library and asked to look at the archives
loretta is thirteen in the three years she has been here she has had five of these outbreaks and has been punished good and hard for them
the child's ancestral record is simple mother died of alcoholic dementia bloomingdale asylum
father unknown
he studied the page long and frowningly and shook his head
with a heredity like that is it right to punish the child for having a shattered nervous system
it is not said i firmly
we will mend her shattered nervous system
if we can
we'll feed her up on codliver oil and sunshine and find a nice kind foster mother who will take pity on the poor little  but then my voice trailed off into nothing as i pictured loretta's face with her hollow eyes and big nose and open mouth and no chin and stringy hair and stickingout ears
no foster mother in the world would love a child who looked like that
why oh why i wailed doesn't the good lord send orphan children with blue eyes and curly hair and loving dispositions
i could place a million of that sort in kind homes but no one wants loretta
i'm afraid the good lord doesn't have anything to do with bringing our lorettas into the world
it is the devil who attends to them
poor sandy
he gets awfully pessimistic about the future of the universe but i don't wonder with such a cheerless life as he leads
he looked today as though his own nervous system was shattered
he had been splashing about in the rain since five this morning when he was called to a sick baby case
i made him sit down and have some tea and we had a nice cheerful talk on drunkenness and idiocy and epilepsy and insanity
he dislikes alcoholic parents but he ties himself into a knot over insane parents
privately i don't believe there's one thing in heredity provided you snatch the babies away before their eyes are opened
we've got the sunniest youngster here you ever saw his mother and aunt ruth and uncle silas all died insane but he is as placid and unexcitable as a cow
goodby my dear
i am sorry this is not a more cheerful letter though at this moment nothing unpleasant seems to be happening
it's eleven o'clock and i have just stuck my head into the corridor and all is quiet except for two banging shutters and leaking eaves
i promised jane i would go to bed at ten
good night and joy be wi' ye baith
sallie
ps
there is one thing in the midst of all my troubles that i have to be grateful for the hon
cy has been stricken with a lingering attack of grippe
in a burst of thankfulness i sent him a bunch of violets
ps

we are having an epidemic of pinkeye
may 
good morning my dear judy
three days of sunshine and the j g h is smiling
i am getting my immediate troubles nicely settled
those beastly blankets have dried at last and our camps have been made livable again
they are floored with wooden slats and roofed with tar paper
mr witherspoon calls them chicken coops
we are digging a stonelined ditch to convey any further cloudbursts from the plateau on which they stand to the cornfield below
the indians have resumed savage life and their chief is back at his post
the doctor and i have been giving loretta higgins's nerves our most careful consideration
we think that this barrack life with its constant movement and stir is too exciting and we have decided that the best plan will be to board her out in a private family where she will receive a great deal of individual attention
the doctor with his usual resourcefulness has produced the family
they live next door to him and are very nice people i have just returned from calling
the husband is foreman of the casting room at the iron works and the wife is a comfortable soul who shakes all over when she laughs
they live mostly in their kitchen in order to keep the parlor neat but it is such a cheerful kitchen that i should like to live in it myself
she has potted begonias in the window and a nice purry tiger cat asleep on a braided rug in front of the stove
she bakes on saturdaycookies and gingerbread and doughnuts
i am planning to pay my weekly call upon loretta every saturday morning at eleven o'clock
apparently i made as favorable an impression on mrs wilson as she made on me
after i had gone she confided to the doctor that she liked me because i was just as common as she was
loretta is to learn housework and have a little garden of her own and particularly play out of doors in the sunshine
she is to go to bed early and be fed up on nice nourishing food and they are to pet her and make her happy
all this for three dollars a week
why not find a hundred such families and board out all the children
then this building could be turned into an idiot asylum and i not knowing anything about idiots could conscientiously resign and go back home and live happily ever after
really judy i am growing frightened
this asylum will get me if i stay long enough
i am becoming so interested in it that i can't think or talk or dream of anything else
you and jervis have blasted all my prospects in life
suppose i should retire and marry and have a family
as families go nowadays i couldn't hope for more than five or six children at the most and all with the same heredity
but mercy
such a family appears perfectly insignificant and monotonous
you have institutionalized me
reproachfully yours  sallie mcbride
ps
we have a child here whose father was lynched
isn't that a piquant detail to have in one's history
tuesday
dearest judy  what shall we do
mamie prout does not like prunes
this antipathy to a cheap and healthful foodstuff is nothing but imagination and ought not to be countenanced among the inmates of a wellmanaged institution
mamie must be made to like prunes
so says our grammar teacher who spends the noonday hour with us and overlooks the morals of our charges
about one o'clock today she marched mamie to my office charged with the offense of refusing absolutely refusing to open her mouth and put in a prune
the child was plumped down on a stool to await punishment from me
now as you know i do not like bananas and i should hate awfully to be forced to swallow them so by the same token why should i force mamie prout to swallow prunes
while i was pondering a course that would seem to uphold miss keller's authority but would at the same time leave a loophole for mamie i was called to the telephone
sit there until i come back i said and went out and closed the door
the message was from a kind lady wishing to motor me to a committee meeting
i didn't tell you that i am organizing local interest in our behalf
the idle rich who possess estates in this neighborhood are beginning to drift out from town and i am laying my plans to catch them before they are deflected by too many garden parties and tennis tournaments
they have never been of the slightest use to this asylum and i think it's about time they woke up to a realization of our presence
returning at teatime i was waylaid in the hall by dr macrae who demanded some statistics from my office
i opened the door and there sat mamie prout exactly where she had been left four hours before
mamie darling
i cried in horror
you haven't been here all this time
yes ma'am said mamie you told me to wait until you came back
that poor patient little thing was fairly swaying with weariness but she never uttered a whimper
i will say for sandy that he was sweet
he gathered her up in his arms and carried her to my library and petted her and caressed her back to smiles
jane brought the sewing table and spread it before the fire and while the doctor and i had tea mamie had her supper
i suppose according to the theory of some educators now when she was thoroughly worn out and hungry would have been the psychological moment to ply her with prunes
but you will be pleased to hear that i did nothing of the sort and that the doctor for once upheld my unscientific principles
mamie had the most wonderful supper of her life embellished with strawberry jam from my private jar and peppermints from sandy's pocket
we returned her to her mates happy and comforted but still possessing that regrettable distaste for prunes
did you ever know anything more appalling than this soulcrushing unreasoning obedience which mrs lippett so insistently fostered
it's the orphan asylum attitude toward life and somehow i must crush it out
initiative responsibility curiosity inventiveness fightoh dear
i wish the doctor had a serum for injecting all these useful virtues into an orphan's circulation
later
i wish you'd come back to new york
i've appointed you press agent for this institution and we need some of your floweriest writing immediately
there are seven tots here crying to be adopted and it's your business to advertise them
little gertrude is crosseyed but dear and affectionate and generous
can't you write her up so persuasively that some loving family will be willing to take her even if she isn't beautiful
her eyes can be operated on when she's older but if it were a cross disposition she had no surgeon in the world could remove that
the child knows there is something missing though she has never seen a live parent in her life
she holds up her arms persuasively to every person who passes
put in all the pathos you are capable of and see if you can't fetch her a mother and father
maybe you can get one of the new york papers to run a sunday feature article about a lot of different children
i'll send some photographs
you remember what a lot of responses that smiling joe picture brought for the sea breeze people
i can furnish equally taking portraits of laughing lou and gurgling gertrude and kicking karl if you will just add the literary touch
and do find me some sports who are not afraid of heredity
this wanting every child to come from one of the first families of virginia is getting tiresome
yours as usual  sallie
friday
my dear dear judy  such an upheaval
i've discharged the cook and the housekeeper and in delicate language conveyed the impression to our grammar teacher that she needn't come back next year
but oh if i could only discharge the honorable cy
i must tell you what happened this morning
our trustee who has had a dangerous illness is now dangerously well again and dropped in to pay a neighborly call
punch was occupying a rug on my library floor virtuously engaged with building blocks
i am separating him from the other kindergarten children and trying the montessori method of a private rug and no nervous distraction
i was flattering myself that it was working well his vocabulary of late has become almost prudish
after half an hour's desultory visit the hon
cy rose to go
as the door closed behind him i am at least thankful the child waited for that punch raised his appealing brown eyes to mine and murmured with a confiding smile  gee
ain't he got de hell of a mug
if you know a kind christian family where i can place out a sweet little fiveyear boy please communicate at once with  s mcbride  sup't john grier home
dear pendletons  i've never known anything like you two snails
you've only just reached washington and i have had my suitcase packed for days ready to spend a rejuvenating week end chez vous
please hurry
i've languished in this asylum atmosphere as long as humanely possible
i shall gasp and die if i don't get a change
yours  on the point of suffocation  s mcb
ps
drop a card to gordon hallock telling him you are there
he will be charmed to put himself and the capitol at your disposal
i know that jervis doesn't like him but jervis ought to get over his baseless prejudices against politicians
who knows
i may be entering politics myself some day
my dear judy  we do receive the most amazing presents from our friends and benefactors
listen to this
last week mr wilton j leverett i quote from his card ran over a broken bottle outside our gate and came in to visit the institution while his chauffeur was mending the tire
betsy showed him about
he took an intelligent interest in everything he saw particularly our new camps
that is an exhibit which appeals to men
he ended by removing his coat and playing baseball with two tribes of indians
after an hour and a half he suddenly looked at his watch begged for a glass of water and bowed himself off
we had entirely forgotten the episode until this afternoon when the expressman drove up to the door with a present for the john grier home from the chemical laboratories of wilton j leverett
it was a barrelwell anyway a good sized kegfull of liquid green soap
did i tell you that the seeds for our garden came from washington
a polite present from gordon hallock and the u s government
as an example of what the past regime did not accomplish martin schladerwitz who has spent three years on this pseudo farm knew no more than to dig a grave two feet deep and bury his lettuce seeds
oh you can't imagine the number of fields in which we need making over but of course you of all people can imagine
little by little i am getting my eyes wide open and things that just looked funny to me at first nowoh dear
it's very disillusionizing
every funny thing that comes up seems to have a little tragedy wrapped inside it
just at present we are paying anxious attention to our mannersnot orphan asylum manners but dancing school manners
there is to be nothing uriah heepish about our attitude toward the world
the little girls make curtseys when they shake hands and the boys remove caps and rise when a lady stands and push in chairs at the table
tommy woolsey shot sadie kate into her soup yesterday to the glee of all observers except sadie who is an independent young damsel and doesn't care for these useless masculine attentions
at first the boys were inclined to jeer but after observing the politeness of their hero percy de forest witherspoon they have come up to the mark like little gentlemen
punch is paying a call this morning
for the last halfhour while i have been busily scratching away to you he has been established in the window seat quietly and undestructively engaged with colored pencils
betsy en passant just dropped a kiss upon his nose
aw gwan
said punch blushing quite pink and wiping off the caress with a fine show of masculine indifference
but i notice he has resumed work upon his redandgreen landscape with heightened ardor and an attempt at whistling
we'll succeed yet in conquering that young man's temper
tuesday
the doctor is in a very grumbly mood today
he called just as the children were marching in to dinner whereupon he marched too and sampled their food and oh my dear
the potatoes were scorched
and such a clishmaclaver as that man made
it is the first time the potatoes ever have been scorched and you know that scorching sometimes happens in the best of families
but you would think from sandy's language that the cook had scorched them on purpose in accordance with my orders
as i have told you before i could do very nicely without sandy
wednesday
yesterday being a wonderful sunny day betsy and i turned our backs upon duty and motored to the very fancy home of some friends of hers where we had tea in an italian garden
punch and sadie kate had been such good children all day that at the last moment we telephoned for permission to include them too
yes indeed do bring the little dears was the enthusiastic response
but the choice of punch and sadie kate was a mistake
we ought to have taken mamie prout who has demonstrated her ability to sit
i shall spare you the details of our visit the climax was reached when punch went goldfishing in the bottom of the swimming pool
our host pulled him out by an agitated leg and the child returned to the asylum swathed in that gentleman's rosecolored bathrobe
what do you think
dr robin macrae in a contrite mood for having been so intensely disagreeable yesterday has just invited betsy and me to take supper in his olivegreen house next sunday evening at seven o'clock in order to look at some microscopic slides
the entertainment i believe is to consist of a scarletfever culture some alcoholic tissue and a tubercular gland
these social attentions bore him excessively but he realizes that if he is to have free scope in applying his theories to the institution he must be a little polite to its superintendent
i have just read this letter over and i must admit that it skips lightly from topic to topic
but though it may not contain news of any great moment i trust you will realize that its writing has consumed every vacant minute during the last three days
i am  most fully occupied  sallie mcbride
ps
a blessed woman came this morning and said she would take a child for the summerone of the sickest weakest neediest babies i could give her
she had just lost her husband and wanted something hard to do
isn't that really very touching
saturday afternoon
dear judy and jervis  brother jimmie we are very alliterative
 spurred on by sundry begging letters from me has at last sent us a present but he picked it out himself
we have a monkey
his name is java
the children no longer hear the school bell ring
on the day the creature came this entire institution formed in line and filed past and shook his paw
poor sing's nose is out of joint
i have to pay to have him washed
sadie kate is developing into my private secretary
i have her answer the thankyou letters for the institution and her literary style is making a hit among our benefactors
she invariably calls out a second gift
i had hitherto believed that the kilcoyne family sprang from the wild west of ireland but i begin to suspect that their source was nearer blarney castle
you can see from the inclosed copy of the letter she sent to jimmie what a persuasive pen the young person has
i trust that in this case at least it will not bear the fruit that she suggests
dear mr jimie  we thank you very much for the lovly monkey you give
we name him java because that's a warm iland across the ocian where he was born up in a nest like a bird only big the doctor told us
the first day he come every boy and girl shook his hand and said good morning java his hand feels funny he holds so tite
i was afraid to touch him but now i let him sit on my shoulder and put his arms around my kneck if he wants to
he makes a funny noise that sounds like swering and gets mad when his tale is puled
we love him dearly and we love you two
the next time you have to give a present please send an elifant
well i guess ill stop
yours truly  sadie kate kilcoyne
percy de forest witherspoon is still faithful to his little followers though i am so afraid he will get tired that i urge him to take frequent vacations
he has not only been faithful himself but has brought in recruits
he has large social connections in the neighborhood and last saturday evening he introduced two friends nice men who sat around the campfire and swapped hunting stories
one of them was just back from around the world and told hairraising anecdotes of the head hunters of sarawak a narrow pink country on the top of borneo
my little braves pant to grow up and get to sarawak and go out on the warpath after head hunters
every encyclopedia in this institution has been consulted and there isn't a boy here who cannot tell you the history manners climate flora and fungi of borneo
i only wish mr witherspoon would introduce friends who had been head hunting in england france and germany countries not quite so chic as sarawak but more useful for general culture
we have a new cook the fourth since my reign began
i haven't bothered you with my cooking troubles but institutions don't escape any more than families
the last is a negro woman a big fat smiling chocolatecolored creature from souf ca'lina
and ever since she came on honey dew we've fed
her name iswhat do you guess
sallie if you please
i suggested that she change it
sho miss i's had dat name sallie longer'n you an' i couldn't get used nohow to answerin' up pertlike when you sings out mollie'
seems like sallie jest b'longs to me
so sallie she remains but at least there is no danger of our getting our letters mixed for her last name is nothing so plebeian as mcbride
it's johnstonwashington with a hyphen
sunday
our favorite game of late is finding pet names for sandy
his austere presence lends itself to caricature
we have just originated a new batch
the laird o' cockpen is percy's choice
the laird o' cockpen he's proud and he's great his mind is ta'en up wi' the things of the state
miss snaith disgustedly calls him that man and betsy refers to him in his absence as dr
codliver
my present favorite is macphairson clon glocketty angus mcclan
but for real poetic feeling sadie kate beats us all
she calls him mister someday soon
i don't believe that the doctor ever dropped into verse but once in his life but every child in this institution knows that one poem by heart
someday soon something nice is going to happen  be a good little girl and take this hint swallow with a smile your codliver ile  and the first thing you know you will have a peppermint
it's this evening that betsy and i attend his supper party and i confess that we are looking forward to seeing the interior of his gloomy mansion with gleeful eagerness
he never talks about himself or his past or anybody connected with himself
he appears to be an isolated figure standing on a pedestal labeled s c i e n c e without a glimmer of any ordinary affections or emotions or human frailties except temper
betsy and i are simply eaten up with curiosity to know what sort of past he came out of but just let us get inside his house and to our detective senses it will tell its own story
so long as the portal was guarded by a fierce mcgurk we had despaired of ever effecting an entrance but now behold
the door has opened of its own accord
to be continued
s mcb
monday
dear judy  we attended the doctor's supper party last night betsy and mr witherspoon and i
it turned out a passably cheerful occasion though i will say that it began under heavy auspices
his house on the inside is all that the outside promises
never in my life have i seen such an interior as that man's dining room
the walls and carpets and lambrequins are a heavy dark green
a black marble mantelpiece shelters a few smoking black coals
the furniture is as nearly black as furniture comes
the decorations are two steel engravings in shiny black framesthe monarch of the glen and the stag at bay
we tried hard to be light and sparkling but it was like eating supper in the family vault
mrs mcgurk in black alpaca with a black silk apron clumped around the table passing cold heavy things to eat with a step so firm that she rattled the silver in the sideboard drawers
her nose was up and her mouth was down
she clearly does not approve of the master's entertaining and she wishes to discourage all guests from ever accepting again
sandy sort of dimly knows that there is something the matter with his house and in order to brighten it up a bit in honor of his guests he had purchased flowersdozens of themthe most exquisite pink killarney roses and red and yellow tulips
the mcgurk had wedged them all together as tight as they would fit into a peacockblue jardiniere and plumped it down in the center of the table
the thing was as big as a bushelbasket
betsy and i nearly forgot our manners when we saw that centerpiece but the doctor seemed so innocently pleased at having obtained a bright note in his dining room that we suppressed our amusement and complimented him warmly upon his happy color scheme
the moment supper was over we hastened with relief to his own part of the house where the mcgurk's influence does not penetrate
no one in a cleaning capacity ever enters either his library or office or laboratory except llewelyn a short wiry bowlegged welshman who combines to a unique degree the qualities of chambermaid and chauffeur
the library though not the most cheerful room i have ever seen still for a man's house is not so badbooks all around from floor to ceiling with the overflow in piles on floor and table and mantelpiece half a dozen abysmal leather chairs and a rug or so with another black marble mantelpiece but this time containing a crackling wood fire
by way of bricabrac he has a stuffed pelican and a crane with a frog in its mouth also a raccoon sitting on a log and a varnished tarpon
a faint suggestion of iodoform floats in the air
the doctor made the coffee himself in a french machine and we dismissed his housekeeper from our spirits
he really did do his best to be a thoughtful host and i have to report that the word insanity was not once mentioned
it seems that sandy in his moments of relaxation is a fisherman
he and percy began swapping stories of salmon and trout and he finally got out his case of fishing flies and gallantly presented betsy and me with a silver doctor and a jack scott out of which to make hatpins
then the conversation wandered to sport on the scotch moors and he told about one time when he was lost and spent the night out in the heather
there is no doubt about it sandy's heart is in the highlands
i am afraid that betsy and i have wronged him
though it is hard to relinquish the interesting idea he may not after all have committed a crime
we are now leaning to the belief that he was crossed in love
it's really horrid of me to make fun of poor sandy for despite his stern bleakness of disposition he's a pathetic figure of a man
think of coming home after an anxious day's round to eat a solitary dinner in that grim dining room
do you suppose it would cheer him up a little if i should send my company of artists to paint a frieze of rabbits around the wall
with love as usual  sallie
dear judy  aren't you ever coming back to new york
please hurry
i need a new hat and am desirous of shopping for it on fifth avenue not on water street
mrs gruby our best milliner does not believe in slavishly following paris fashions she originates her own styles
but three years ago as a great concession to convention she did make a tour of the new york shops and is still creating models on the uplift of that visit
also besides my own hat i must buy  hats for my children to say nothing of shoes and knickerbockers and shirts and hairribbons and stockings and garters
it's quite a task to keep a little family like mine decently clothed
did you get that big letter i wrote you last week
you never had the grace to mention it in yours of thursday and it was seventeen pages long and took me days to write
yours truly  s mcbride
ps
why don't you tell me some news about gordon
have you seen him and did he mention me
is he running after any of those pretty southern girls that washington is so full of
you know that i want to hear
why must you be so beastly uncommunicative
tuesday  pm  dear judy  your telegram came two minutes ago by telephone
yes thank you i shall be delighted to arrive at  on thursday afternoon
and don't make any engagements for that evening please as i intend to sit up until midnight talking john grier gossip with you and the president
friday and saturday and monday i shall have to devote to shopping
oh yes you're right i already possess more clothes than any jailbird needs but when spring comes i must have new plumage
as it is i wear an evening gown every night just to wear them outno not entirely that to make myself believe that i'm still an ordinary girl despite this extraordinary life that you have pushed me into
the hon
cy found me yesterday arrayed in a nilegreen crepe jane's creation though it looked parisian
he was quite puzzled when he found i wasn't going to a ball
i invited him to stay and dine with me and he accepted
we got on very affably
he expands over his dinner
food appears to agree with him
if there's any bernard shaw in new york just now i believe that i might spare a couple of hours saturday afternoon for a matinee
g b s's dialogue would afford such a lifegiving contrast to the hon
cy's
there's no use writing any more i'll wait and talk
addio
sallie
ps
oh dear
just as i had begun to catch glimmerings of niceness in sandy he broke out again and was abominable
we unfortunately have five cases of measles in this institution and the man's manner suggests that miss snaith and i gave the measles to the children on purpose to make him trouble
there are many days when i should be willing to accept our doctor's resignation
wednesday
dear enemy  your brief and dignified note of yesterday is at hand
i have never known anybody whose literary style resembled so exactly his spoken word
and you will be greatly obliged if i will drop my absurd fashion of calling you enemy
i will drop my absurd fashion of calling you enemy just as soon as you drop your absurd fashion of getting angry and abusive and insulting the moment any little thing goes wrong
i am leaving tomorrow afternoon to spend four days in new york
yours truly  s mcbride
chez the pendletons new york
my dear enemy  i trust that this note will find you in a more affable frame of mind than when i saw you last
i emphatically repeat that it was not due to the carelessness of the superintendent of our institution that those two new cases of measles crept in but rather to the unfortunate anatomy of our oldfashioned building which does not permit of the proper isolation of contagious cases
as you did not deign to visit us yesterday morning before i left i could not offer any parting suggestions
i therefore write to ask that you cast your critical eye upon mamie prout
she is covered all over with little red spots which may be measles though i am hoping not
mamie spots very easily
i return to prison life next monday at six o'clock
yours truly  s mcbride
ps
i trust you will pardon my mentioning it but you are not the kind of doctor that i admire
i like them chubby and round and smiling
the john grier home  june 
dear judy  you are an awful family for an impressionable young girl to visit
how can you expect me to come back and settle down contentedly to institution life after witnessing such a happy picture of domestic concord as the pendleton household presents
all the way back in the train instead of occupying myself with two novels four magazines and one box of chocolates that your husband thoughtfully provided i spent the time in a mental review of the young men of my acquaintance to see if i couldn't discover one as nice as jervis
i did
a little nicer i think
from this day on he is the markeddown victim the destined prey
i shall hate to give up the asylum after getting so excited over it but unless you are willing to move it to the capital i don't see any alternative
the train was awfully late
we sat and smoked on a siding while two accommodations and a freight dashed past
i think we must have broken something and had to tinker up our engine
the conductor was soothing but uncommunicative
it was  when i descended the only passenger at our insignificant station in the pitch darkness and rain without an umbrella and wearing that precious new hat
no turnfelt to meet me not even a station hack
to be sure i hadn't telegraphed the exact time of my arrival but still i did feel rather neglected
i had sort of vaguely expected all one hundred and thirteen to be drawn up by the platform scattering flowers and singing songs of welcome
just as i was telling the station man that i would watch his telegraph instrument while he ran across to the corner saloon and telephoned for a vehicle there came whirling around the corner two big searchlights aimed straight at me
they stopped nine inches before running me down and i heard sandy's voice saying  weel weel miss sallie mcbride
i'm thinking it's ower time you came back to tak' the bit bairns off my hands
that man had come three times to meet me on the off chance of the train's getting in some time
he tucked me and my new hat and bags and books and chocolates all in under his waterproof flap and we splashed off
really i felt as if i was getting back home again and quite sad at the thought of ever having to leave
mentally you see i had already resigned and packed and gone
the mere idea that you are not in a place for the rest of your life gives you an awfully unstable feeling
that's why trial marriages would never work
you've got to feel you're in a thing irrevocably and forever in order to buckle down and really put your whole mind into making it a success
it's astounding how much news can accrue in four days
sandy just couldn't talk fast enough to tell me everything i wanted to hear
among other items i learned that sadie kate had spent two days in the infirmary her malady being according to the doctor's diagnosis half a jar of gooseberry jam and heaven knows how many doughnuts
her work had been changed during my absence to dishwashing in the officers' pantry and the juxtaposition of so many exotic luxuries was too much for her fragile virtue
also our colored cook sallie and our colored useful man noah have entered upon a war of extermination
the original trouble was over a little matter of kindling augmented by a pail of hot water that sallie threw out of the window with for a woman unusual accuracy of aim
you can see what a rare character the head of an orphan asylum must have
she has to combine the qualities of a baby nurse and a police magistrate
the doctor had told only the half when we reached the house and as he had not yet dined owing to meeting me three times i begged him to accept the hospitality of the john grier
i would get betsy and mr witherspoon and we would hold an executive meeting and settle all our neglected businesses
sandy accepted with flattering promptness
he likes to dine outside of the family vault
but betsy i found had dashed home to greet a visiting grandparent and percy was playing bridge in the village
it's seldom the young thing gets out of an evening and i'm glad for him to have a little cheerful diversion
so it ended in the doctor's and my dining teteatete on a hastily improvised dinnerit was then close upon eight and our normal dinner hour is but it was such an improvised dinner as i am sure mrs mcgurk never served him
sallie wishing to impress me with her invaluableness did her absolutely southern best
and after dinner we had coffee before the fire in my comfortable blue library while the wind howled outside and the shutters banged
we passed a most cordial and intimate evening
for the first time since our acquaintance i struck a new note in the man
there really is something attractive about him when you once come to know him
but the process of knowing him requires time and tact
he's no' very gleg at the uptak
i've never seen such a tantalizing inexplicable person
all the time i'm talking to him i feel as though behind his straight line of a mouth and his halfshut eyes there were banked fires smoldering inside
are you sure he hasn't committed a crime
he does manage to convey the delicious feeling that he has
and i must add that sandy's not so bad a talker when he lets himself go
he has the entire volume of scotch literature at his tongue's end
little kens the auld wife as she sits by the fire what the wind is doing on hurlyburlyswire he observed as a specially fierce blast drove the rain against the window
that sounds pat doesn't it
i haven't though the remotest idea what it means
and listen to this between cups of coffee he drinks far too much coffee for a sensible medical man he casually let fall the news that his family knew the r l s family personally and used to take supper at  heriot row
i tended him assiduously for the rest of the evening in a did you once see shelley plain and did he stop and speak to you
frame of mind
when i started this letter i had no intention of filling it with a description of the recently excavated charms of robin macrae it's just by way of remorseful apology
he was so nice and companionable last night that i have been going about today feeling consciencesmitten at the thought of how mercilessly i made fun of him to you and jervis
i really didn't mean quite all of the impolite things that i said
about once a month the man is sweet and tractable and engaging
punch has just been paying a social call and during the course of it he lost three little toadlings an inch long
sadie kate recovered one of them from under the bookcase but the other two hopped away and i'm so afraid they've taken sanctuary in my bed
i do wish that mice and snakes and toads and angleworms were not so portable
you never know what is going on in a perfectly respectablelooking child's pocket
i had a beautiful visit in casa pendleton
don't forget your promise to return it soon
yours as ever  sallie
ps
i left a pair of paleblue bedroom slippers under the bed
will you please have mary wrap them up and mail them to me
and hold her hand while she writes the address
she spelt my name on the place cards mackbird
tuesday
dear enemy  as i told you i left an application for an accomplished nurse with the employment bureau of new york
wanted
a nurse maid with an ample lap suitable for the accommodation of seventeen babies at once
she came this afternoon and this is the fine figure of a woman that i drew
we couldn't keep a baby from sliding off her lap unless we fastened him firmly with safety pins
please give sadie kate the magazine
i'll read it tonight and return it tomorrow
was there ever a more docile and obedient pupil than  s mcbride
thursday
my dear judy  i've been spending the last three days busily getting under way all those latest innovations that we planned in new york
your word is law
a public cooky jar has been established
also the eighty play boxes have been ordered
it is a wonderful idea having a private box for each child where he can store up his treasures
the ownership of a little personal property will help develop them into responsible citizens
i ought to have thought of it myself but for some reason the idea didn't come
poor judy
you have inside knowledge of the longings of their little hearts that i shall never be able to achieve not with all the sympathy i can muster
we are doing our best to run this institution with as few discommoding rules as possible but in regard to those play boxes there is one point on which i shall have to be firm
the children may not keep in them mice or toads or angleworms
i can't tell you how pleased i am that betsy's salary is to be raised and that we are to keep her permanently
but the hon
cy wykoff deprecates the step
he has been making inquiries and he finds that her people are perfectly able to take care of her without any salary
you don't furnish legal advice for nothing say i to him
why should she furnish her trained services for nothing
this is charitable work
then work which is undertaken for your own good should be paid but work which is undertaken for the public good should not be paid
fiddlesticks
says he
she's a woman and her family ought to support her
this opened up vistas of argument which i did not care to enter with the hon
cy so i asked him whether he thought it would be nicer to have a real lawn or hay on the slope that leads to the gate
he likes to be consulted and i pamper him as much as possible in all unessential details
you see i am following sandy's canny advice trustees are like fiddlestrings they maunna be screwed ower tight
humor the mon but gang your ain gait
oh the tact that this asylum is teaching me
i should make a wonderful politician's wife
thursday night
you will be interested to hear that i have temporarily placed out punch with two charming spinsters who have long been tottering on the brink of a child
they finally came last week and said they would like to try one for a month to see what the sensation felt like
they wanted of course a pretty ornament dressed in pink and white and descended from the mayflower
i told them that any one could bring up a daughter of the mayflower to be an ornament to society but the real feat was to bring up a son of an italian organgrinder and an irish washerwoman
and i offered punch
that neapolitan heredity of his artistically speaking may turn out a glorious mixture if the right environment comes along to choke out all the weeds
i put it up to them as a sporting proposition and they were game
they have agreed to take him for one month and concentrate upon his remaking all their years of conserved force to the end that he may be fit for adoption in some moral family
they both have a sense of humor and accomplishing characters or i should never have dared to propose it
and really i believe it's going to be the one way of taming our young fireeater
they will furnish the affection and caresses and attention that in his whole abused little life he has never had
they live in a fascinating old house with an italian garden and furnishings selected from the whole round world
it does seem like sacrilege to turn that destructive child loose in such a collection of treasures
but he hasn't broken anything here for more than a month and i believe that the italian in him will respond to all that beauty
i warned them that they must not shrink from any profanity that might issue from his pretty baby lips
he departed last night in a very fancy automobile and maybe i wasn't glad to say goodby to our disreputable young man
he has absorbed just about half of my energy
friday
the pendant arrived this morning
many thanks
but you really ought not to have given me another a hostess cannot be held accountable for all the things that careless guests lose in her house
it is far too pretty for my chain
i am thinking of having my nose pierced cingalese fashion and wearing my new jewel where it will really show
i must tell you that our percy is putting some good constructive work into this asylum
he has founded the john grier bank and has worked out all the details in a very professional and businesslike fashion entirely incomprehensible to my nonmathematical mind
all of the older children possess properly printed checkbooks and they are each to be paid five dollars a week for their services such as going to school and accomplishing housework
they are then to pay the institution by check for their board and clothes which will consume their five dollars
it looks like a vicious circle but it's really very educative they will comprehend the value of money before we dump them into a mercenary world
those who are particularly good in lessons or work will receive an extra recompense
my head aches at the thought of the bookkeeping but percy waves that aside as a mere bagatelle
it is to be accomplished by our prize arithmeticians and will train them for positions of trust
if jervis hears of any opening for bank officials let me know i shall have a welltrained president cashier and paying teller ready to be placed by this time next year
saturday
our doctor doesn't like to be called enemy
it hurts his feelings or his dignity or something of the sort
but since i will persist despite his expostulations he has finally retaliated with a nickname for me
he calls me miss sally lunn and is in a glow of pride at having achieved such an imaginative flight
he and i have invented a new pastime he talks scotch and i answer in irish
our conversations run like this  good afthernoon to ye docther
an' how's yer health the day
verra weel verra weel
and how gas it wi' a' the bairns
shure they're all av thim doin' foin
i'm gey glad to hear it
this saft weather is hard on folk
there's muckle sickness aboot the kintra
hiven be praised it has not lighted here
but sit down docther an' make yersilf at home
will ye be afther havin' a cup o' tay
hoot woman
i would na hae you fash yoursel' but a wee drap tea winna coom amiss
whist
it's no thruble at all
you may not think this a very dizzying excursion into frivolity but i assure you for one of sandy's dignity it's positively riotous
the man has been in a heavenly temper ever since i came back not a single cross word
i am beginning to think i may reform him as well as punch
this letter must be about long enough even for you
i've been writing it bit by bit for three days whenever i happened to pass my desk
yours as ever  sallie
ps
i don't think much of your vaunted prescription for hair tonic
either the druggist didn't mix it right or jane didn't apply it with discretion
i stuck to the pillow this morning
the john grier home  saturday
dear gordon  your letter of thursday is at hand and extremely silly i consider it
of course i am not trying to let you down easy that isn't my way
if i let you down at all it will be suddenly and with an awful bump
but i honestly didn't realize that it had been three weeks since i wrote
please excuse
also my dear sir i have to bring you to account
you were in new york last week and you never ran up to see us
you thought we wouldn't find it out but we heardand are insulted
would you like an outline of my day's activities
wrote monthly report for trustees' meeting
audited accounts
entertained agent of state charities aid association for luncheon
supervised children's menus for next ten days
dictated five letters to families who have our children
visited our little feebleminded loretta higgins pardon the reference i know you don't like me to mention the feebleminded who is being boarded out in a nice comfortable family where she is learning to work
came back to tea and a conference with the doctor about sending a child with tubercular glands to a sanatorium
read an article on cottage versus congregate system for housing dependent children
we do need cottages
i wish you'd send us a few for a christmas present
and now at nine o'clock i'm sleepily beginning a letter to you
do you know many young society girls who can point to such a useful day as that
oh i forgot to say that i stole ten minutes from my accounts this morning to install a new cook
our sallie washingtonjohnston who cooked fit for the angels had a dreadful dreadful temper and terrorized poor noah our superexcellent furnace man to the point of giving notice
we couldn't spare noah
he's more useful to the institution than its superintendent and so sallie washingtonjohnston is no more
when i asked the new cook her name she replied ma name is suzanne estelle but ma friends call me pet
pet cooked the dinner tonight but i must say that she lacks sallie's delicate touch
i am awfully disappointed that you didn't visit us while sallie was still here
you would have taken away an exalted opinion of my housekeeping
drowsiness overcame me at that point and it's now two days later
poor neglected gordon
it has just occurred to me that you never got thanked for the modeling clay which came two weeks ago and it was such an unusually intelligent present that i should have telegraphed my appreciation
when i opened the box and saw all that nice messy putty stuff i sat down on the spot and created a statue of singapore
the children love it and it is very good to have the handicraft side of their training encouraged
after a careful study of american history i have determined that nothing is so valuable to a future president as an early obligatory unescapable performance of chores
therefore i have divided the daily work of this institution into a hundred parcels and the children rotate weekly through a succession of unaccustomed tasks
of course they do everything badly for just as they learn how they progress to something new
it would be infinitely easier for us to follow mrs lippett's immoral custom of keeping each child sentenced for life to a welllearned routine but when the temptation assails me i recall the dreary picture of florence henty who polished the brass doorknobs of this institution for seven yearsand i sternly shove the children on
i get angry every time i think of mrs lippett
she had exactly the point of view of a tammany politicianno slightest sense of service to society
her only interest in the john grier home was to get a living out of it
wednesday
what new branch of learning do you think i have introduced into my asylum
table manners
i never had any idea that it was such a lot of trouble to teach children how to eat and drink
their favorite method is to put their mouths down to their mugs and lap their milk like kittens
good manners are not merely snobbish ornaments as mrs lippett's regime appeared to believe
they mean selfdiscipline and thought for others and my children have got to learn them
that woman never allowed them to talk at their meals and i am having the most dreadful time getting any conversation out of them above a frightened whisper
so i have instituted the custom of the entire staff myself included sitting with them at the table and directing the talk along cheerful and improving lines
also i have established a small very strict training table where the little dears in relays undergo a week of steady badgering
our uplifting table conversations run like this  yes tom napoleon bonaparte was a very great manelbows off the table
he possessed a tremendous power of concentrating his mind on whatever he wanted to have and that is the way to accomplishdon't snatch susan ask politely for the bread and carrie will pass it to youbut he was an example of the fact that selfish thought just for oneself without considering the lives of others will come to disaster in thetom
keep your mouth shut when you chewand after the battle of waterloolet sadie's cooky alonehis fall was all the greater becausesadie kate you may leave the table
it makes no difference what he did
under no provocation does a lady slap a gentleman
two more days have passed this is the same kind of meandering letter i write to judy
at least my dear man you can't complain that i haven't been thinking about you this week
i know you hate to be told all about the asylum but i can't help it for it's all i know
i don't have five minutes a day to read the papers
the big outside world has dropped away
my interests all lie on the inside of this little iron inclosure
i am at present  s mcbride  superintendent of the  john grier home
thursday
dear enemy  time is but the stream i go afishing in
hasn't that a very philosophical detached lord of the universe sound
it comes from thoreau whom i am assiduously reading at present
as you see i have revolted against your literature and taken to my own again
the last two evenings have been devoted to walden a book as far removed as possible from the problems of the dependent child
did you ever read old henry david thoreau
you really ought
i think you'd find him a congenial soul
listen to this society is commonly too cheap
we meet at very short intervals not having had time to acquire any new value for each other
it would be better if there were but one habitation to a square mile as where i live
a pleasant expansive neeborlike man he must have been
he minds me in some ways o' sandy
this is to tell you that we have a placingout agent visiting us
she is about to dispose of four chicks one of them thomas kehoe
what do you think
ought we to risk it
the place she has in mind for him is a farm in a nolicense portion of connecticut where he will work hard for his board and live in the farmer's family
it sounds exactly the right thing and we can't keep him here forever he'll have to be turned out some day into a world full of whisky
i'm sorry to tear you away from that cheerful work on dementia precox but i'd be most obliged if you'd drop in here toward eight o'clock for a conference with the agent
i am as usual  s mcbride
june 
my dear judy  betsy has perpetrated a most unconscionable trick upon a pair of adopting parents
they have traveled east from ohio in their touring car for the dual purpose of seeing the country and picking up a daughter
they appear to be the leading citizens of their town whose name at the moment escapes me but it's a very important town
it has electric lights and gas and mr
leading citizen owns the controlling interest in both plants
with a wave of his hand he could plunge that entire town into darkness but fortunately he's a kind man and won't do anything so harsh not even if they fail to reelect him mayor
he lives in a brick house with a slate roof and two towers and has a deer and fountain and lots of nice shade trees in the yard
he carries its photograph in his pocket
they are goodnatured generous kindhearted smiling people and a little fat you can see what desirable parents they would make
well we had exactly the daughter of their dreams only as they came without giving us notice she was dressed in a flannellet nightgown and her face was dirty
they looked caroline over and were not impressed but they thanked us politely and said they would bear her in mind
they wanted to visit the new york orphanage before deciding
we knew well that if they saw that superior assemblage of children our poor little caroline would never have a chance
then betsy rose to the emergency
she graciously invited them to motor over to her house for tea that afternoon and inspect one of our little wards who would be visiting her baby niece
mr and mrs
leading citizen do not know many people in the east and they haven't been receiving the invitations that they feel are their due so they were quite innocently pleased at the prospect of a little social diversion
the moment they had retired to the hotel for luncheon betsy called up her car and rushed baby caroline over to her house
she stuffed her into baby niece's best pinkandwhite embroidered frock borrowed a hat of irish lace some pink socks and white slippers and set her picturesquely upon the green lawn under a spreading beech tree
a whiteaproned nurse borrowed also from baby niece plied her with bread and milk and gaily colored toys
by the time prospective parents arrived our caroline full of food and contentment greeted them with cooes of delight
from the moment their eyes fell upon her they were ravished with desire
not a suspicion crossed their unobservant minds that this sweet little rosebud was the child of the morning
and so a few formalities having been complied with it really looks as though baby caroline would live in the towers and grow into a leading citizen
i must really get to work without any further delay upon the burning question of new clothes for our girls
with the highest esteem i am d'r ma'am y'r most ob'd't and h'mble serv't  sal

june th
my dearest judy  listen to the grandest innovation of all and one that will delight your heart
no more blue gingham
feeling that this aristocratic neighborhood of country estates might contain valuable food for our asylum i have of late been moving in the village social circles and at a luncheon yesterday i dug out a beautiful and charming widow who wears delectable flowing gowns that she designs herself
she confided to me that she would have loved to have been a dressmaker if she had only been born with a needle in her mouth instead of a golden spoon
she says she never sees a pretty girl badly dressed but she longs to take her in hand and make her over
did you ever hear anything so apropos
from the moment she opened her lips she was a marked man
i can show you fiftynine badly dressed girls said i to her and you have got to come back with me and plan their new clothes and make them beautiful
she expostulated but in vain
i led her out to her automobile shoved her in and murmured john grier home to the chauffeur
the first inmate our eyes fell upon was sadie kate just fresh i judge from hugging the molasses barrel and a shocking spectacle she was for any esthetically minded person
in addition to the stickiness one stocking was coming down her pinafore was buttoned crookedly and she had lost a hairribbon
butas alwayscompletely at ease she welcomed us with a cheery grin and offered the lady a sticky paw
now said i in triumph you see how much we need you
what can you do to make sadie kate beautiful
wash her said mrs livermore
sadie kate was marched to my bathroom
when the scrubbing was finished and the hair strained back and the stocking restored to seemly heights i returned her for a second inspectiona perfectly normal little orphan
mrs livermore turned her from side to side and studied her long and earnestly
sadie kate by nature is a beauty a wild dark gypsyish little colleen
she looks fresh from the windswept moors of connemara
but oh we have managed to rob her of her birthright with this awful institution uniform
after five minutes' silent contemplation mrs livermore raised her eyes to mine
yes my dear you need me
and then and there we formed our plans
she is to head the committee on c l o t h e s she is to choose three friends to help her
and they with the two dozen best sewers among the girls and our sewingteacher and five sewing machines are going to make over the looks of this institution
and the charity is all on our side
we are supplying mrs livermore with the profession that providence robbed her of
wasn't it clever of me to find her
i woke this morning at dawn and crowed
lots more newsi could run into a second volumebut i am going to send this letter to town by mr witherspoon who in a very high collar and the blackest of evening clothes is on the point of departure for a barn dance at the country club
i told him to pick out the nicest girls he danced with to come and tell stories to my children
it is dreadful the scheming person i am getting to be
all the time i am talking to any one i am silently thinking what use can you be to my asylum
there is grave danger that this present superintendent will become so interested in her job that she will never want to leave
i sometimes picture her a whitehaired old lady propelled about the building in a wheeled chair but still tenaciously superintending her fourth generation of orphans
please discharge her before that day
yours  sallie
friday
dear judy  yesterday morning without the slightest warning a station hack drove up to the door and disgorged upon the steps two men two little boys a baby girl a rocking horse and a teddy bear and then drove off
the men were artists and the little ones were children of another artist dead three weeks ago
they had brought the mites to us because they thought john grier sounded solid and respectable and not like a public institution
it had never entered their unbusinesslike heads that any formality is necessary about placing a child in an asylum
i explained that we were full but they seemed so stranded and aghast that i told them to sit down while i advised them what to do
so the chicks were sent to the nursery with a recommendation of bread and milk while i listened to their history
those artists had a fatally literary touch or maybe it was just the sound of the baby girl's laugh but anyway before they had finished the babes were ours
never have i seen a sunnier creature than the little allegra we don't often get such fancy names or such fancy children
she is three years old is lisping funny baby talk and bubbling with laughter
the tragedy she has just emerged from has never touched her
but don and clifford sturdy little lads of five and seven are already solemneyed and frightened at the hardness of life
their mother was a kindergarten teacher who married an artist on a capital of enthusiasm and a few tubes of paint
his friends say that he had talent but of course he had to throw it away to pay the milkman
they lived in a haphazard fashion in a rickety old studio cooking behind screens the babies sleeping on shelves
but there seems to have been a very happy side to ita great deal of love and many friends all more or less poor but artistic and congenial and highthinking
the little lads in their gentleness and fineness show that phase of their upbringing
they have an air which many of my children despite all the good manners i can pour into them will forever lack
the mother died in the hospital a few days after allegra's birth and the father struggled on for two years caring for his brood and painting like madadvertisements anythingto keep a roof over their heads
he died in st vincent's three weeks agooverwork worry pneumonia
his friends rallied about the babies sold such of the studio fittings as had escaped pawning paid off the debts and looked about for the best asylum they could find
and heaven save them
they hit upon us
well i kept the two artists for luncheonnice creatures in soft hats and windsor ties and looking pretty frayed themselvesand then started them back to new york with the promise that i would give the little family my most parental attention
so here they are one little mite in the nursery two in the kindergarten room four big packing cases full of canvases in the cellar and a trunk in the store room with the letters of their father and mother
and a look in their faces an intangible spiritual something that is their heritage
i can't get them out of my mind
all night long i was planning their future
the boys are easy
they have already been graduated from college mr pendleton assisting and are pursuing honorable business careers
but allegra i don't know about i can't think what to wish for the child
of course the normal thing to wish for any sweet little girl is that two kind foster parents will come along to take the place of the real parents that fate has robbed her of
but in this case it would be cruel to steal her away from her brothers
their love for the baby is pitiful
you see they have brought her up
the only time i ever hear them laugh is when she has done something funny
the poor little fellows miss their father horribly
i found don the fiveyearold one sobbing in his crib last night because he couldn't say good night to daddy
but allegra is true to her name the happiest young miss of three i have ever seen
the poor father managed well by her and she little ingrate has already forgotten that she has lost him
whatever can i do with these little ones
i think and think and think about them
i can't place them out and it does seem too awful to bring them up here for as good as we are going to be when we get ourselves made over still after all we are an institution and our inmates are just little incubator chicks
they don't get the individual fussy care that only an old hen can give
there is a lot of interesting news that i might have been telling you but my new little family has driven everything out of my mind
bairns are certain joy but nae sma' care
yours ever  sallie
ps
don't forget that you are coming to visit me next week
ps
ii
the doctor who is ordinarily so scientific and unsentimental has fallen in love with allegra
he didn't so much as glance at her tonsils he simply picked her up in his arms and hugged her
oh she is a little witch
whatever is to become of her
june 
my dear judy  i may report that you need no longer worry as to our inadequate fire protection
the doctor and mr witherspoon have been giving the matter their gravest attention and no game yet devised has proved so entertaining and destructive as our fire drill
the children all retire to their beds and plunge into alert slumber
fire alarm sounds
they spring up and into their shoes snatch the top blanket from their beds wrap it around their imaginary nightclothes fall into line and trot to the hall and stairs
our seventeen little tots in the nursery are each in charge of an indian and are bundled out shrieking with delight
the remaining indians so long as there is no danger of the roof falling devote themselves to salvage
on the occasion of our first drill percy in command the contents of a dozen clothes lockers were dumped into sheets and hurled out of the windows
i usurped dictatorship just in time to keep the pillows and mattresses from following
we spent hours resorting those clothes while percy and the doctor having lost all interest strolled up to the camp with their pipes
our future drills are to be a touch less realistic
however i am pleased to tell you that under the able direction of fire chief witherspoon we emptied the building in six minutes and twentyeight seconds
that baby allegra has fairy blood in her veins
never did this institution harbor such a child barring one that jervis and i know of
she has completely subjugated the doctor
instead of going about his visits like a sober medical man he comes down to my library hand in hand with allegra and for half an hour at a time crawls about on a rug pretending he's a horse while the bonnie wee lassie sits on his back and kicks
you know i am thinking of putting a card in the paper  characters neatly remodeled
s mcbride
sandy dropped in two nights ago to have a bit of conversation with betsy and me and he was frivolous
he made three jokes and he sat down at the piano and sang some old scotch my luve's like a red red rose and come under my plaidie and wha's at the window
wha
wha
not in the least educational and then danced a few steps of the strathspey
i sat and beamed upon my handiwork for it's true i've done it all through my frivolous example and the books i've given him and the introducing of such lightsome companions as jimmie and percy and gordon hallock
if i have a few more months in which to work i shall get the man human
he has given up purple ties and at my tactful suggestion has adopted a suit of gray
you have no idea how it sets him off
he will be quite distinguished looking as soon as i can make him stop carrying bulgy things in his pockets
goodby and remember that we're expecting you on friday
sallie
ps
here is a picture of allegra taken by mr witherspoon
isn't she a love
her present clothes do not enhance her beauty but in the course of a few weeks she will move into a pink smocked frock
wednesday june   am mrs jervis pendleton
madam  your letter is at hand stating that you cannot visit me on friday per promise because your husband has business that keeps him in town
what clishmaclaver is this
has it come to such a pass that you can't leave him for two days
i did not let  babies interfere with my visit to you and i see no reason why you should let one husband interfere with your visit to me
i shall meet the berkshire express on friday as agreed
s mcbride
june 
my dear judy  that was a very flying visit you paid us but for all small favors we are grateful
i am awfully pleased that you were so delighted with the way things are going and i can't wait for jervis and the architect to get up here and really begin a fundamental rippingup
you know i had the queerest feeling all the time that you were here
i can't make it seem true that you my dear wonderful judy were actually brought up in this institution and know from the bitter inside what these little tots need
sometimes the tragedy of your childhood fills me with an anger that makes me want to roll up my sleeves and fight the whole world and force it into making itself over into a place more fit for children to live in
that scotchirish ancestry of mine seems to have deposited a tremendous amount of fight in my character
if you had started me with a modern asylum equipped with nice clean hygienic cottages and everything in running order i couldn't have stood the monotony of its perfect clockwork
it's the sight of so many things crying to be done that makes it possible for me to stay
sometimes i must confess i wake up in the morning and listen to these institution noises and sniff this institution air and long for the happy carefree life that by rights is mine
you my dear witch cast a spell over me and i came
but often in the night watches your spell wears thin and i start the day with the burning decision to run away from the john grier home
but i postpone starting until after breakfast
and as i issue into the corridor one of these pathetic tots runs to meet me and shyly slips a warm crumpled little fist into my hand and looks up with wide baby eyes mutely asking for a little petting and i snatch him up and hug him
and then as i look over his shoulder at the other forlorn little mites i long to take all  into my arms and love them into happiness
there is something hypnotic about this working with children
struggle as you may it gets you in the end
your visit seems to have left me in a broadly philosophical frame of mind but i really have one or two bits of news that i might convey
the new frocks are marching along and oh but they are going to be sweet
mrs livermore was entranced with those particolored bales of cotton cloth you sentyou should see our workroom with it all scattered aboutand when i think of sixty little girls attired in pink and blue and yellow and lavender romping upon our lawn of a sunny day i feel that we should have a supply of smoked eye glasses to offer visitors
of course you know that some of those brilliant fabrics are going to be very fadeable and impractical
but mrs livermore is as bad as youshe doesn't give a hang
she'll make a second and a third set if necessary
down with checked gingham
i am glad you liked our doctor
of course we reserve the right to say anything about him we choose but our feelings would be awfully hurt if anybody else should make fun of him
he and i are still superintending each other's reading
last week he appeared with herbert spencer's system of synthetic philosophy for me to glance at
i gratefully accepted it and gave him in return the diary of marie bashkirtseff
do you remember in college how we used to enrich our daily speech with quotations from marie
well sandy took her home and read her painstakingly and thoughtfully
yes he acknowledged today when he came to report it is a truthful record of a certain kind of morbid egotistical personality that unfortunately does exist
but i can't understand why you care to read it for thank god
sally lunn you and bash haven't anything in common
that's the nearest to a compliment he ever came and i feel extremely flattered
as to poor marie he refers to her as bash because he can't pronounce her name and is too disdainful to try
we have a child here the daughter of a chorus girl and she is a conceited selfish vain posing morbid lying little minx but she has eyelashes
sandy has taken the most violent dislike to that child
and since reading poor marie's diary he has found a new comprehensive adjective for summing up all of her distressing qualities
he calls her bashy and dismisses her
goodby and come again
sallie
ps
my children show a distressing tendency to draw out their entire bank accounts to buy candy
tuesday night
my dear judy  what do you think sandy has done now
he has gone off on a pleasure trip to that psychopathic institution whose head alienist visited us a month or so ago
did you ever know anything like the man
he is fascinated by insane people and can't let them alone
when i asked for some parting medical instructions he replied  feed a cowld and hunger a colic and put nae faith in doctors
with that advice and a few bottles of codliver oil we are left to our own devices
i feel very free and adventurous
perhaps you had better run up here again as there's no telling what joyous upheaval i may accomplish when out from under sandy's dampening influence
s   the john grier home  friday
dear enemy  here i stay lashed to the mast while you run about the country disporting yourself with insane people
and just as i was thinking that i had nicely cured you of this morbid predilection for psychopathic institutions
it's very disappointing
you had seemed almost human of late
may i ask how long you are intending to stay
you had permission to go for two days and you've already been away four
charlie martin fell out of a cherry tree yesterday and cut his head open and we were driven to calling in a foreign doctor
five stitches
patient doing well
but we don't like to depend on strangers
i wouldn't say a word if you were away on legitimate business but you know very well that after associating with melancholics for a week you will come back home in a dreadful state of gloom dead sure that humanity is going to the dogs and upon me will fall the burden of getting you decently cheerful again
do leave those insane people to their delusions and come back to the john grier home which needs you
i am most fervent' your friend and servant s mcb
ps
don't you admire that poetical ending
it was borrowed from robert burns whose works i am reading assiduously as a compliment to a scotch friend
july 
dear judy  that doctor man is still away
no word just disappeared into space
i don't know whether he is ever coming back or not but we seem to be running very happily without him
i lunched yesterday chez the two kind ladies who have taken our punch to their hearts
the young man seems to be very much at home
he took me by the hand and did the honors of the garden presenting me with the bluebell of my choice
at luncheon the english butler lifted him into his chair and tied on his bib with as much manner as though he were serving a prince of the blood
the butler has lately come from the household of the earl of durham punch from a cellar in houston street
it was a very uplifting spectacle
my hostesses entertained me afterward with excerpts from their table conversations of the last two weeks
i wonder the butler hasn't given notice he looked like a respectable man
if nothing more comes of it at least punch has furnished them with funny stories for the rest of their lives
one of them is even thinking of writing a book
at least says she wiping hysterical tears from her eyes we have lived
the hon
cy dropped in at  last night and found me in an evening gown starting for a dinner at mrs livermore's house
he mildly observed that mrs lippett did not aspire to be a society leader but saved her energy for her work
you know i'm not vindictive but i never look at that man without wishing he were at the bottom of the duck pond securely anchored to a rock
otherwise he'd pop up and float
singapore respectfully salutes you and is very glad that you can't see him as he now appears
a shocking calamity has befallen his good looks
some bad childand i don't think she's a boyhas clipped that poor beastie in spots until he looks like a mangy motheaten checkerboard
no one can imagine who did it
sadie kate is very handy with the scissors but she is also handy with an alibi
during the time when the clipping presumably occurred she was occupying a stool in the corner of the schoolroom with her face to the wall as twentyeight children can testify
however it has become sadie kate's daily duty to treat those spots with your hair tonic
i am as usual  sallie
ps
this is a recent portrait of the hon
cy drawn from life
the man in some respects is a fascinating talker he makes gestures with his nose
thursday evening
dear judy  sandy is back after a tendays' absenceno explanationsand plunged deep into gloom
he resents our amiable efforts to cheer him up and will have nothing to do with any of us except baby allegra
he took her to his house for supper tonight and never brought her back until halfpast seven a scandalous hour for a young miss of three
i don't know what to make of our doctor he grows more incomprehensible every day
but percy now is an openminded confiding young man
he has just been making a dinner call he is very punctilious in all social matters and our entire conversation was devoted to the girl in detroit
he is lonely and likes to talk about her and the wonderful things he says
i hope that miss detroit is worthy of all this fine affection but i'm afraid
he fetched out a leather case from the innermost recesses of his waistcoat and reverently unwrapping two layers of tissuepaper showed me the photograph of a silly little thing all eyes and earrings and fuzzy hair
i did my best to appear congratulatory but my heart shut up out of pity for the poor boy's future
isn't it funny how the nicest men often choose the worst wives and the nicest women the worst husbands
their very niceness i suppose makes them blind and unsuspicious
you know the most interesting pursuit in the world is studying character
i believe i was meant to be a novelist people fascinate meuntil i know them thoroughly
percy and the doctor form a most engaging contrast
you always know at any moment what that nice young man is thinking about he is written like a primer in big type and onesyllable words
but the doctor
he might as well be written in chinese so far as legibility goes
you have heard of people with a dual nature well sandy possesses a triple one
usually he's scientific and as hard as granite but occasionally i suspect him of being quite a sentimental person underneath his official casing
for days at a time he will be patient and kind and helpful and i begin to like him then without any warning an untamed wild man swells up from the innermost depths andoh dear
the creature's impossible
i always suspect that sometime in the past he has suffered a terrible hurt and that he is still brooding over the memory of it
all the time he is talking you have the uncomfortable feeling that in the far back corners of his mind he is thinking something else
but this may be merely my romantic interpretation of an uncommonly bad temper
in any case he's baffling
we have been waiting for a week for a fine windy afternoon and this is it
my children are enjoying kiteday a leaf taken from japan
all of the bigenough boys and most of the girls are spread over knowltop that high rocky sheep pasture which joins us on the east flying kites made by themselves
i had a dreadful time coaxing the crusty old gentleman who owns the estate into granting permission
he doesn't like orphans he says and if he once lets them get a start in his grounds the place will be infested with them forever
you would think to hear him talk that orphans were a pernicious kind of beetle
but after half an hour's persuasive talking on my part he grudgingly made us free of his sheep pasture for two hours provided we didn't step foot into the cow pasture over the lane and came home promptly when our time was up
to insure the sanctity of his cow pasture mr knowltop has sent his gardener and chauffeur and two grooms to patrol its boundaries while the flying is on
the children are still at it and are having a wonderful adventure racing over that windy height and getting tangled up in one another's strings
when they come panting back they are to have a surprise in the shape of ginger cookies and lemonade
these pitiful little youngsters with their old faces
it's a difficult task to make them young but i believe i'm accomplishing it
and it really is fun to feel you're doing something positive for the good of the world
if i don't fight hard against it you'll be accomplishing your purpose of turning me into a useful person
the social excitements of worcester almost seem tame before the engrossing interest of  live warm wriggling little orphans
yours with love  sallie
ps
i believe to be accurate that it's  children i possess this afternoon
dear judy  this being sunday and a beautiful blossoming day with a warm wind blowing i sat at my window with the hygiene of the nervous system sandy's latest contribution to my mental needs open in my lap and my eyes on the prospect without
thank heaven
thought i that this institution was so commandingly placed that at least we can look out over the castiron wall which shuts us in
i was feeling very coopedup and imprisoned and like an orphan myself so i decided that my own nervous system required fresh air and exercise and adventure
straight before me ran that white ribbon of road that dips into the valley and up over the hills on the other side
ever since i came i have longed to follow it to the top and find out what lies beyond those hills
poor judy
i dare say that very same longing enveloped your childhood
if any one of my little chicks ever stands by the window and looks across the valley to the hills and asks what's over there
i shall telephone for a motor car
but today my chicks were all piously engaged with their little souls i the only wanderer at heart
i changed my silken sunday gown for homespun planning meanwhile a means to get to the top of those hills
then i went to the telephone and brazenly called up 
good afternoon mrs mcgurk said i very sweet
may i be speaking with dr
macrae
howld the wire said she very short
afternoon doctor said i to him
have ye by chance any dying patients who live on the top o' the hills beyant
i have not thank the lord
'tis a pity said i disappointed
and what are ye afther doin' with yerself the day
i am reading the origin of species'
shut it up it's not fit for sunday
and tell me now is yer motor car iled and ready to go
it is at your disposal
are you wanting me to take some orphans for a ride
just one who's sufferin' from a nervous system
she's taken a fixed idea that she must get to the top o' the hills
my car is a grand climber
in fifteen minutes  wait
said i
bring with ye a frying pan that's a decent size for two
there's nothing in my kitchen smaller than a cart wheel
and ask mrs mcgurk can ye stay out for supper
so i packed in a basket a jar of bacon and some eggs and muffins and ginger cookies with hot coffee in the thermos bottle and was waiting on the steps when sandy chugged up with his automobile and frying pan
we really had a beautiful adventure and he enjoyed the sensation of running away exactly as much as i
not once did i let him mention insanity
i made him look at the wide stretches of meadow and the lines of pollard willows backed by billowing hills and sniff the air and listen to the cawing crows and the tinkle of cowbells and the gurgling of the river
and we talkedoh about a million things far removed from our asylum
i made him throw away the idea that he is a scientist and pretend to be a boy
you will scarcely credit the assertion but he succeededmore or less
he did pull off one or two really boyish pranks
sandy is not yet out of his thirties and mercy
that is too early to be grown up
we camped on a bluff overlooking our view gathered some driftwood built a fire and cooked the nicest suppera sprinkling of burnt stick in our fried eggs but charcoal's healthy
then when sandy had finished his pipe and the sun was setting in its wonted west we packed up and coasted back home
he says it was the nicest afternoon he has had in years and poor deluded man of science i actually believe it's true
his olive green home is so uncomfortable and dreary and uninspiring that i don't wonder he drowns his troubles in books
just as soon as i can find a nice comfortable house mother to put in charge i am going to plot for the dismissal of maggie mcgurk though i foresee that she will be even harder than sterry to pry from her moorings
please don't draw the conclusion that i am becoming unduly interested in our badtempered doctor for i'm not
it's just that he leads such a comfortless life that i sometimes long to pat him on the head and tell him to cheer up the world's full of sunshine and some of it's for himjust as i long to comfort my hundred and seven orphans so much and no more
i am sure that i had some real news to tell you but it has completely gone out of my head
the rush of fresh air has made me sleepy
it's halfpast nine and i bid you good night
s  ps
gordon hallock has evaporated into thin air
not a word for three weeks no candy or stuffed animals or tokimentoes of any description
what on earth do you suppose has become of that attentive young man
july 
dearest judy  hark to the glad tidings
this being the thirtyfirst day of punch's month i telephoned to his two patronesses as nominated in the bond to arrange for his return
i was met by an indignant refusal
give up their sweet little volcano just as they are getting it trained not to belch forth fire
they are outraged that i can make such an ungrateful request
punch has accepted their invitation to spend the summer
the dressmaking is still going on
you should hear the machines whir and the tongues clatter in the sewing room
our most cowed apathetic spiritless little orphan cheers up and takes an interest in life when she hears that she is to possess three perfectly private dresses of her own and each a different color chosen by herself
and you should see how it encourages their sewing ability
even the little tenyearolds are bursting into seamstresses
i wish i could devise an equally effective way to make them take an interest in cooking
but our kitchen is extremely uneducative
you know how hampering it is to one's enthusiasm to have to prepare a bushel of potatoes at once
i think you've heard me mention the fact that i should like to divide up my kiddies into ten nice little families with a nice comfortable house mother over each
if we just had ten picturesque cottages to put them in with flowers in the front yard and rabbits and kittens and puppies and chickens in the back we should be a perfectly presentable institution and wouldn't be ashamed to have these charity experts come visiting us
thursday
i started this letter three days ago was interrupted to talk to a potential philanthropist fifty tickets to the circus and have not had time to pick up my pen since
betsy has been in philadelphia for three days being a bridesmaid for a miserable cousin
i hope that no more of her family are thinking of getting married for it's most upsetting to the j g h  while there she investigated a family who had applied for a child
of course we haven't a proper investigating plant but once in a while when a family drops right into our arms we do like to put the business through
as a usual thing we work with the state charities' aid association
they have a lot of trained agents traveling about the state keeping in touch with families who are willing to take children and with asylums that have them to give
since they are willing to work for us there is no slightest use in our going to the expense of peddling our own babies
and i do want to place out as many as are available for i firmly believe that a private home is the best thing for the child provided of course that we are very fussy about the character of the homes we choose
i don't require rich foster parents but i do require kind loving intelligent parents
this time i think betsy has landed a gem of a family
the child is not yet delivered or the papers signed and of course there is always danger that they may give a sudden flop and splash back into the water
ask jervis if he ever heard of j f bretland of philadelphia
he seems to move in financial circles
the first i ever heard of him was a letter addressed to the supt
john grier home dear sira curt typewritten businesslike letter from an awfully businesslike lawyer saying that his wife had determined to adopt a baby girl of attractive appearance and good health between the ages of two and three years
the child must be an orphan of american stock with unimpeachable heredity and no relatives to interfere
could i furnish one as required and oblige yours truly j f bretland
by way of reference he mentioned bradstreets
did you ever hear of anything so funny
you would think he was opening a charge account at a nursery and inclosing an order from our seed catalogue
we began our usual investigation by mailing a reference blank to a clergyman in germantown where the j f
b
's reside
does he own any property
does he pay his bills
is he kind to animals
does he attend church
does he quarrel with his wife
and a dozen other impertinent questions
we evidently picked a clergyman with a sense of humor
instead of answering in laborious detail he wrote up and down and across the sheet i wish they'd adopt me
this looked promising so b kindred obligingly dashed out to germantown as soon as the wedding breakfast was over
she is developing the most phenomenal detective instinct
in the course of a social call she can absorb from the chairs and tables a family's entire moral history
she returned from germantown bursting with enthusiastic details
mr j f bretland is a wealthy and influential citizen cordially loved by his friends and deeply hated by his enemies discharged employees who do not hesitate to say that he is a harrd man
he is a little shaky in his attendance at church but his wife seems regular and he gives money
she is a charming kindly cultivated gentlewoman just out of a sanatorium after a year of nervous prostration
the doctor says that what she needs is some strong interest in life and advises adopting a child
she has always longed to do it but her hard husband has stubbornly refused
but finally as always it is the gentle persistent wife who has triumphed and hard husband has been forced to give in
waiving his own natural preference for a boy he wrote as above the usual request for a blueeyed girl
mrs bretland with the firm intention of taking a child has been reading up for years and there is no detail of infant dietetics that she does not know
she has a sunny nursery with a southwestern exposure all ready
and a closet full of surreptitiously gathered dolls
she has made the clothes for them herselfshe showed them to betsy with the greatest prideso you can understand the necessity for a girl
she has just heard of an excellent english trained nurse that she can secure but she isn't sure but that it would be better to start with a french nurse so that the child can learn the language before her vocal cords are set
also she was extremely interested when she heard that betsy was a college woman
she couldn't make up her mind whether to send the baby to college or not
what was betsy's honest opinion
if the child were betsy's own daughter would betsy send her to college
all this would be funny if it weren't so pathetic but really i can't get away from the picture of that poor lonely woman sewing those doll clothes for the little unknown girl that she wasn't sure she could have
she lost her own two babies years ago or rather she never had them they were never alive
you can see what a good home it's going to be
there's lots of love waiting for the little mite and that is better than all the wealth which in this case goes along
but the problem now is to find the child and that isn't easy
the j f bretlands are so abominably explicit in their requirements
i have just the baby boy to give them but with that closetful of dolls he is impossible
little florence won't doone tenacious parent living
i've a wide variety of foreigners with liquid brown eyeswon't do at all
mrs bretland is a blonde and daughter must resemble her
i have several sweet little mites with unspeakable heredity but the bretlands want six generations of churchattending grandparents with a colonial governor at the top
also i have a darling little curlyheaded girl and curls are getting rarer and rarer but illegitimate
and that seems to be an unsurmountable barrier in the eyes of adopting parents though as a matter of fact it makes no slightest difference in the child
however she won't do
the bretlands hold out sternly for a marriage certificate
there remains just one child out of all these one hundred and seven that appears available
our little sophie's father and mother were killed in a railroad accident and the only reason she wasn't killed was because they had just left her in a hospital to get an abscess cut out of her throat
she comes from good common american stock irreproachable and uninteresting in every way
she's a washedout spiritless whiney little thing
the doctor has been pouring her full of his favorite codliver oil and spinach but he can't get any cheerfulness into her
however individual love and care does accomplish wonders in institution children and she may bloom into something rare and beautiful after a few months' transplanting
so i yesterday wrote a glowing account of her immaculate family history to j f bretland offering to deliver her in germantown
this morning i received a telegram from j f b
not at all
he does not purpose to buy any daughter sight unseen
he will come and inspect the child in person at three o'clock on wednesday next
oh dear if he shouldn't like her
we are now bending all our energies toward enhancing that child's beautylike a pup bound for the dog show
do you think it would be awfully immoral if i rouged her cheeks a suspicion
she is too young to pick up the habit
heavens
what a letter
a million pages written without a break
you can see where my heart is
i'm as excited over little sophie's settling in life as though she were my own darling daughter
respectful regards to the president
sal

dear gordon  that was an obnoxious beastly lowdown trick not to send me a cheering line for four weeks just because in a period of abnormal stress i once let you go for three
i had really begun to be worried for fear you'd tumbled into the potomac
my chicks would miss you dreadfully they love their uncle gordon
please remember that you promised to send them a donkey
please also remember that i'm a busier person than you
it's a lot harder to run the john grier home than the house of representatives
besides you have more efficient people to help
this isn't a letter it's an indignant remonstrance
i'll write tomorrowor the next day
s  ps
on reading your letter over again i am slightly mollified but dinna think i believe a' your saft words
i ken weel ye only flatter when ye speak sae fair
july 
dear judy  i have a history to recount
this please remember is wednesday next
so at halfpast two o'clock our little sophie was bathed and brushed and clothed in fine linen and put in charge of a trusty orphan with anxious instructions to keep her clean
at threethirty to the minutenever have i known a human being so disconcertingly businesslike as j f bretlandan automobile of expensive foreign design rolled up to the steps of this imposing chateau
a squareshouldered squarejawed personage with a choppedoff mustache and a manner that inclines one to hurry presented himself three minutes later at my library door
he greeted me briskly as miss mckosh
i gently corrected him and he changed to miss mckim
i indicated my most soothing armchair and invited him to take some light refreshment after his journey
he accepted a glass of water i admire a temperate parent and evinced an impatient desire to be done with the business
so i rang the bell and ordered the little sophie to be brought down
hold on miss mcgee
said he to me
i'd rather see her in her own environment
i will go with you to the playroom or corral or wherever you keep your youngsters
so i led him to the nursery where thirteen or fourteen mites in gingham rompers were tumbling about on mattresses on the floor
sophie alone in the glory of feminine petticoats was ensconced in the blueginghamed arms of a very bored orphan
she was squirming and fighting to get down and her feminine petticoats were tightly wound about her neck
i took her in my arms smoothed her clothes wiped her nose and invited her to look at the gentleman
that child's whole future hung upon five minutes of sunniness and instead of a single smile she whined
mr bretland shook her hand in a very gingerly fashion and chirruped to her as you might to a pup
sophie took not the slightest notice of him but turned her back and buried her face in my neck
he shrugged his shoulders supposed that they could take her on trial
she might suit his wife he himself didn't want one anyway
and we turned to go out
then who should come toddling straight across his path but that little sunbeam allegra
exactly in front of him she staggered threw her arms about like a windmill and plumped down on all fours
he hopped aside with great agility to avoid stepping on her and then picked her up and set her on her feet
she clasped her arms about his leg and looked up at him with a gurgling laugh
daddy
frow baby up
he is the first man barring the doctor whom the child has seen for weeks and evidently he resembles somewhat her almost forgotten father
j f bretland picked her up and tossed her in the air as handily as though it were a daily occurrence while she ecstatically shrieked her delight
then when he showed signs of lowering her she grasped him by an ear and a nose and drummed a tattoo on his stomach with both feet
no one could ever accuse allegra of lacking vitality
j f disentangled himself from her endearments and emerged rumpled as to hair but with a firmset jaw
he set her on her feet but retained her little doubledup fist
this is the kid for me he said
i don't believe i need to look any further
i explained that we couldn't separate little allegra from her brothers but the more i objected the stubborner his jaw became
we went back to the library and argued about it for half an hour
he liked her heredity he liked her looks he liked her spirit he liked her
if he was going to have a daughter foisted on him he wanted one with some ginger
he'd be hanged if he'd take that other whimpering little thing
it wasn't natural
but if i gave him allegra he would bring her up as his own child and see that she was provided for for the rest of her life
did i have any right to cut her out from all that just for a lot of sentimental nonsense
the family was already broken up the best i could do for them now was to provide for them individually
take all three said i quite brazenly
but no he couldn't consider that his wife was an invalid and one child was all that she could manage
well i was in a dreadful quandary
it seemed such a chance for the child and yet it did seem so cruel to separate her from those two adoring little brothers
i knew that if the bretlands adopted her legally they would do their best to break all ties with the past and the child was still so tiny she would forget her brothers as quickly as she had her father
then i thought about you judy and of how bitter you have always been because when that family wanted to adopt you the asylum wouldn't let you go
you have always said that you might have had a home too like other children but that mrs lippett stole it away from you
was i perhaps stealing little allegra's home from her
with the two boys it would be different they could be educated and turned out to shift for themselves
but to a girl a home like this would mean everything
ever since baby allegra came to us she has seemed to me just such another child as baby judy must have been
she has ability and spirit
we must somehow furnish her with opportunity
she too deserves her share of the world's beauty and goodas much as nature has fitted her to appreciate
and could any asylum ever give her that
i stood and thought and thought while mr bretland impatiently paced the floor
you have those boys down and let me talk to them mr bretland insisted
if they have a spark of generosity they'll be glad to let her go
i sent for them but my heart was a solid lump of lead
they were still missing their father it seemed merciless to snatch away that darling baby sister too
they came hand in hand sturdy fine little chaps and stood solemnly at attention with big wondering eyes fixed on the strange gentleman
come here boys
i want to talk to you
he took each by a hand
in the house i live in we haven't any little baby so my wife and i decided to come here where there are so many babies without fathers and mothers and take one home to be ours
she will have a beautiful house to live in and lots of toys to play with and she will be happy all her lifemuch happier than she could ever be here
i know that you will be very glad to hear that i have chosen your little sister
and won't we ever see her any more
asked clifford
oh yes sometimes
clifford looked from me to mr bretland and two big tears began rolling down his cheeks
he jerked his hand away and came and hurled himself into my arms
don't let him have her
please
please
send him away
take them all
i begged
but he's a hard man
i didn't come for an entire asylum said he shortly
by this time don was sobbing on the other side
and then who should inject himself into the hubbub but dr macrae with baby allegra in his arms
i introduced them and explained
mr bretland reached for the baby and sandy held her tight
quite impossible said sandy shortly
miss mcbride will tell you that it's one of the rules of this institution never to separate a family
miss mcbride has already decided said j f b stiffly
we have fully discussed the question
you must be mistaken said sandy becoming his scotchest and turning to me
you surely had no intention of performing any such cruelty as this
here was the decision of solomon all over again with two of the stubbornest men that the good lord ever made wresting poor little allegra limb from limb
i despatched the three chicks back to the nursery and returned to the fray
we argued loud and hotly until finally j f b echoed my own frequent query of the last five months who is the head of this asylum the superintendent or the visiting physician
i was furious with the doctor for placing me in such a position before that man but i couldn't quarrel with him in public so i had ultimately to tell mr bretland with finality and flatness that allegra was out of the question
would he not reconsider sophie
no he'd be darned if he'd reconsider sophie
allegra or nobody
he hoped that i realized that i had weakly allowed the child's entire future to be ruined
and with that parting shot he backed to the door
miss macrae dr mcbride good afternoon
he achieved two formal bows and withdrew
and the moment the door closed sandy and i fought it out
he said that any person who claimed to have any modern humane views on the subject of childcare ought to be ashamed to have considered for even a moment the question of breaking up such a family
and i accused him of keeping her for the purely selfish reason that he was fond of the child and didn't wish to lose her
and that i believe is the truth
oh we had the battle of our career and he finally took himself off with a stiffness and politeness that excelled j f
b's
between the two of them i feel as limp as though i'd been run through our new mangling machine
and then betsy came home and reviled me for throwing away the choicest family we have ever discovered
so this is the end of our week of feverish activity and both sophie and allegra are after all to be institution children
oh dear
oh dear
please remove sandy from the staff and send me instead a german a frenchman a chinaman if you chooseanything but a scotchman
yours wearily  sallie
ps
i dare say that sandy is also passing a busy evening in writing to have me removed
i won't object if you wish to do it
i am tired of institutions
dear gordon  you are a captious caviling carping crabbed contentious cantankerous chap
hoot mon
an' why shouldna i drap into scotch gin i choose
an' i with a mac in my name
of course the john grier will be delighted to welcome you on thursday next not only for the donkey but for your sweet sunny presence as well
i was planning to write you a milelong letter to make up for past deficiencies but wha's the use
i'll be seeing you the morn's morn an' unco gude will be the sight o' you for sair een
dinna fash yoursel laddie because o'my language
my forebears were from the hielands
mcbride
dear judy  all's well with the john grierexcept for a broken tooth a sprained wrist a badly scratched knee and one case of pinkeye
betsy and i are being polite but cool toward the doctor
the annoying thing is that he is rather cool too
and he seems to be under the impression that the drop in temperature is all on his side
he goes about his business in a scientific impersonal way entirely courteous but somewhat detached
however the doctor is not disturbing us very extensively at present
we are about to receive a visit from a far more fascinating person than sandy
the house of representatives again rests from its labors and gordon enjoys a vacation two days of which he is planning to spend at the brantwood inn
i am delighted to hear that you have had enough seaside and are considering our neighborhood for the rest of the summer
there are several spacious estates to be had within a few miles of the john grier and it will be a nice change for jervis to come home only at week ends
after a pleasantly occupied absence you will each have some new ideas to add to the common stock
i can't add any further philosophy just now on the subject of married life having to refresh my memory on the monroe doctrine and one or two other political topics
i am looking eagerly forward to august and three months with you
as ever  sallie
friday
dear enemy  it's very forgiving of me to invite you to dinner after that volcanic explosion of last week
however please come
you remember our philanthropic friend mr hallock who sent us the peanuts and goldfish and other indigestible trifles
he will be with us tonight so this is your chance to turn the stream of his benevolence into more hygienic channels
we dine at seven
as ever  sallie mcbride
dear enemy  you should have lived in the days when each man inhabited a separate cave on a separate mountain
s mcbride
friday 
dear judy  gordon is here and a reformed man so far as his attitude toward my asylum goes
he has discovered the worldold truth that the way to a mother's heart is through praise of her children and he had nothing but praise for all  of mine
even in the case of loretta higgins he found something pleasant to say
he thinks it nice that she isn't crosseyed
he went shopping with me in the village this afternoon and was very helpful about picking out hairribbons for a couple of dozen little girls
he begged to choose sadie kate's himself and after many hesitations he hit upon orange satin for one braid and emerald green for the other
while we were immersed in this business i became aware of a neighboring customer ostensibly engaged with hooks and eyes but straining every ear to listen to our nonsense
she was so dressed up in a picture hat a spotted veil a feather boa and a nouveau art parasol that i never dreamed she was any acquaintance of mine till i happened to catch her eye with a familiar malicious gleam in it
she bowed stiffly and disapprovingly and i nodded back
mrs maggie mcgurk in her company clothes
that is a pleasanter expression than she really has
her smile is due to a slip of the pen
poor mrs mcgurk can't understand any possible intellectual interest in a man
she suspects me of wanting to marry every single one that i meet
at first she thought i wanted to snatch away her doctor but now after seeing me with gordon she considers me a bigamous monster who wants them both
goodby some guests approach
 pm
i have just been giving a dinner for gordon with betsy and mrs livermore and mr witherspoon as guests
i graciously included the doctor but he curtly declined on the ground that he wasn't in a social mood
our sandy does not let politeness interfere with truth
there is no doubt about it gordon is the most presentable man that ever breathed
he is so good looking and easy and gracious and witty and his manners are so impeccableoh he would make a wonderfully decorative husband
but after all i suppose you do live with a husband
you don't just show him off at dinners and teas
he was exceptionally nice tonight
betsy and mrs livermore both fell in love with himand i just a trifle
he entertained us with a speech in his best public manner apropos of java's welfare
we have been having a dreadful time finding a sleeping place for that monkey and gordon proved with incontestable logic that since he was presented to us by jimmie and jimmie is percy's friend he should sleep with percy
gordon is a natural talker and an audience affects him like champagne
he can argue with as much emotional earnestness on the subject of a monkey as on the greatest hero that ever bled for his country
i felt tears coming to my eyes when he described java's loneliness as he watched out the night in our furnace cellar and pictured his brothers at play in the faroff tropical jungle
a man who can talk like that has a future before him
i haven't a doubt but that i shall be voting for him for president in another twenty years
we all had a beautiful time and entirely forgotfor a space of three hoursthat  orphans slumbered about us
much as i love the little dears it is pleasant to get away from them once in a while
my guests left at ten and it must be midnight by now
this is the eighth day and my clock has stopped again jane forgets to wind it as regularly as friday comes around
however i know it's late and as a woman it's my duty to try for beauty sleep especially with an eligible young suitor at hand
i'll finish tomorrow
good night
saturday
gordon spent this morning playing with my asylum and planning some intelligent presents to be sent later
he thinks that three neatly painted totem poles would add to the attractiveness of our indian camps
he is also going to make us a present of three dozen pink rompers for the babies
pink is a color that is very popular with the superintendent of this asylum who is deadly tired of blue
our generous friend is likewise amusing himself with the idea of a couple of donkeys and saddles and a little red cart
isn't it nice that gordon's father provided for him so amply and that he is such a charitably inclined young man
he is at present lunching with percy at the hotel and i trust imbibing fresh ideas in the field of philanthropy
perhaps you think i haven't enjoyed this interruption to the monotony of institution life
you can say all you please my dear mrs pendleton about how well i am managing your asylum but just the same it isn't natural for me to be so stationary
i very frequently need a change
that is why gordon with his bubbling optimism and boyish spirits is so exhilarating especially as a contrast to too much doctor
sunday morning
i must tell you the end of gordon's visit
his intention had been to leave at four but in an evil moment i begged him to stay over till  and yesterday afternoon he and singapore and i took a long 'crosscountry walk far out of sight of the towers of this asylum and stopped at a pretty little roadside inn where we had a satisfying supper of ham and eggs and cabbage
sing stuffed so disgracefully that he has been languid ever since
the walk and all was fun and a very grateful change from this monotonous life i lead
it would have kept me pleasant and contented for weeks if something most unpleasant hadn't happened later
we had a beautiful sunny carefree afternoon and i'm sorry to have had it spoiled
we came back very unromantically in the trolley car and reached the j g h before nine just in good time for him to run on to the station and catch his train
so i didn't ask him to come in but politely wished him a pleasant journey at the portecochere
a car was standing at the side of the drive in the shadow of the house
i recognized it and thought the doctor was inside with mr witherspoon
they frequently spend their evenings together in the laboratory
well gordon at the moment of parting was seized with an unfortunate impulse to ask me to abandon the management of this asylum and take over the management of a private house instead
did you ever know anything like the man
he had the whole afternoon and miles of empty meadow in which to discuss the question but instead he must choose our door mat
i don't know just what i did say
i tried to turn it off lightly and hurry him to his train
but he refused to be turned off lightly
he braced himself against a post and insisted upon arguing it out
i knew that he was missing his train and that every window in this institution was open
a man never has the slightest thought of possible overhearers
it is always the woman who thinks of convention
being in a nervous twitter to get rid of him i suppose i was pretty abrupt and tactless
he began to get angry and then by some unlucky chance his eye fell on that car
he recognized it too and being in a savage mood he began making fun of the doctor
old goggleeyes he called him and scatchy and oh the awfullest lot of unmannerly silly things
i was assuring him with convincing earnestness that i didn't care a rap about the doctor that i thought he was just as funny and impossible as he could be when suddenly the doctor rose out of his car and walked up to us
i could have evaporated from the earth very comfortably at that moment
sandy was quite clearly angry as well he might be after the things he'd heard but he was entirely cold and collected
gordon was hot and bursting with imaginary wrongs
i was aghast at this perfectly foolish and unnecessary muddle that had suddenly arisen out of nothing
sandy apologized to me with unimpeachable politeness for inadvertently overhearing and then turned to gordon and stiffly invited him to get into his car and ride to the station
i begged him not to go
i didn't wish to be the cause of any silly quarrel between them
but without paying the slightest attention to me they climbed into the car and whirled away leaving me placidly standing on the door mat
i came in and went to bed and lay awake for hours expecting to heari don't know what kind of explosion
it is now eleven o'clock and the doctor hasn't appeared
i don't know how on earth i shall meet him when he does
i fancy i shall hide in the clothes closet
did you ever know anything as unnecessary and stupid as this whole situation
i suppose now i've quarreled with gordonand i positively don't know over whatand of course my relations with the doctor are going to be terribly awkward
i said horrid things about himyou know the silly way i talkthings i didn't mean in the least
i wish it were yesterday at this time
i would make gordon go at four
sallie
sunday afternoon
dear dr macrae  that was a horrid stupid silly business last night
but by this time you must know me well enough to realize that i never mean the foolish things i say
my tongue has no slightest connection with my brain it just runs along by itself
i must seem to you very ungrateful for all the help you have given me in this unaccustomed work and for the patience you have occasionally shown
i do appreciate the fact that i could never have run this asylum by myself without your responsible presence in the background
and though once in a while as you yourself must acknowledge you have been pretty impatient and bad tempered and difficult still i have never held it up against you and i really didn't mean any of the illmannered things i said last night
please forgive me for being rude
i should hate very much to lose your friendship
and we are friends are we not
i like to think so
s mcb
dear judy  i am sure i haven't an idea whether or not the doctor and i have made up our differences
i sent him a polite note of apology which he received in abysmal silence
he didn't come near us until this afternoon and he hasn't by the blink of an eyelash referred to our unfortunate contretemps
we talked exclusively about an ichthyol salve that will remove eczema from a baby's scalp then sadie kate being present the conversation turned to cats
it seems that the doctor's maltese cat has four kittens and sadie kate will not be silenced until she has seen them
before i knew what was happening i found myself making an engagement to take her to see those miserable kittens at four o'clock tomorrow afternoon
whereupon the doctor with an indifferently polite bow took himself off
and that apparently is the end
your sunday note arrives and i am delighted to hear that you have taken the house
it will be beautiful having you for a neighbor for so long
our improvements ought to march along with you and the president at our elbow
but it does seem as though you ought to get out here before august 
are you sure that city air is good for you just now
i have never known so devoted a wife
my respects to the president

dear judy  please listen to this
at four o'clock i took sadie kate to the doctor's house to look at those cats
but freddy howland just twenty minutes before had fallen downstairs so the doctor was at the howland house occupying himself with freddy's collarbone
he had left word for us to sit down and wait that he would be back shortly
mrs mcgurk ushered us into the library and then not to leave us alone came in herself on a pretense of polishing the brass
i don't know what she thought we'd do
run off with the pelican perhaps
i settled down to an article about the chinese situation in the century and sadie kate roamed about at large examining everything she found like a curious little mongoose
she commenced with his stuffed flamingo and wanted to know what made it so tall and what made it so red
did it always eat frogs and had it hurt its other foot
she ticks off questions with the steady persistency of an eightday clock
i buried myself in my article and left mrs mcgurk to deal with sadie
finally after she had worked halfway around the room she came to a portrait of a little girl occupying a leather frame in the center of the doctor's writing deska child with a queer elflike beauty resembling very strangely our little allegra
this photograph might have been a portrait of allegra grown five years older
i had noticed the picture the night we took supper with the doctor and had meant to ask which of his little patients she was
happily i didn't
who's that
said sadie kate pouncing upon it
it's the docthor's little gurrl
where is she
shure she's far away wit' her gran'ma
where'd he get her
his wife give her to him
i emerged from my book with electric suddenness
his wife
i cried
the next instant i was furious with myself for having spoken but i was so completely taken off my guard
mrs mcgurk straightened up and became volubly conversational at once
and didn't he never tell you about his wife
she went insane six years ago
it got so it weren't safe to keep her in the house and he had to put her away
it near killed him
i never seen a lady more beautiful than her
i guess he didn't so much as smile for a year
it's funny he never told you nothing and you such a friend
naturally it's not a subject he cares to talk about said i dryly and i asked her what kind of brass polish she used
sadie kate and i went out to the garage and hunted up the kittens ourselves and we mercifully got away before the doctor came back
but will you tell me what this means
didn't jervis know he was married
it's the queerest thing i ever heard
i do think as the mcgurk suggests that sandy might casually have dropped the information that he had a wife in an insane asylum
but of course it must be a terrible tragedy and i suppose he can't bring himself to talk about it
i see now why he's so morbid over the question of heredityi dare say he fears for the little girl
when i think of all the jokes i've made on the subject i'm aghast at how i must have hurt him and angry with myself and angry with him
i feel as though i never wanted to see the man again
mercy
did you ever know such a muddle as we are getting ourselves into
yours sallie
ps
tom mccoomb has pushed mamie prout into the box of mortar that the masons use

july 
my dear madam  i have a shocking scandal to report about the superintendent of the john grier home
don't let it get into the newspapers please
i can picture the spicy details of the investigation prior to her removal by the cruelty
i was sitting in the sunshine by my open window this morning reading a sweet book on the froebel theory of child culturenever lose your temper always speak kindly to the little ones
though they may appear bad they are not so in reality
it is either that they are not feeling well or have nothing interesting to do
never punish simply deflect their attention
i was entertaining a very loving uplifted attitude toward all this young life about me when my attention was attracted by a group of little boys beneath the window
awjohndon't hurt it
let it go
kill it quick
and above their remonstrances rose the agonized squealing of some animal in pain
i dropped froebel and running downstairs burst upon them from the side door
they saw me coming and scattered right and left revealing johnnie cobden engaged in torturing a mouse
i will spare you the grisly details
i called to one of the boys to come and drown the creature quick
john i seized by the collar and dragged him squirming and kicking in at the kitchen door
he is a big hulking boy of thirteen and he fought like a little tiger holding on to posts and doorjambs as we passed
ordinarily i doubt if i could have handled him but that one sixteenth irish that i possess was all on top and i was fighting mad
we burst into the kitchen and i hastily looked about for a means of chastisement
the pancake turner was the first utensil that met my eyes
i seized it and beat that child with all my strength until i had reduced him to a cowering whimpering mendicant for mercy instead of the fighting little bully he had been four minutes before
and then who should suddenly burst into the midst of this explosion but dr macrae
his face was blank with astonishment
he strode over and took the pancake turner out of my hand and set the boy on his feet
johnnie got behind him and clung
i was so angry that i really couldn't talk
it was all i could do not to cry
come we will take him up to the office was all the doctor said
and we marched out johnnie keeping as far from me as possible and limping conspicuously
we left him in the outer office and went into my library and shut the door
what in the world has the child done
he asked
at that i simply laid my head down on the table and began to cry
i was utterly exhausted both emotionally and physically
it had taken all the strength i possessed to make the pancake turner effective
i sobbed out all the bloody details and he told me not to think about it the mouse was dead now
then he got me some water to drink and told me to keep on crying till i was tired it would do me good
i am not sure that he didn't pat me on the head
anyway it was his best professional manner
i have watched him administer the same treatment a dozen times to hysterical orphans
and this was the first time in a week that we had spoken beyond the formality of good morning
well as soon as i had got to the stage where i could sit up and laugh intermittently dabbing my eyes with a wad of handkerchief we began a review of johnnie's case
the boy has a morbid heredity and may be slightly defective says sandy
we must deal with the fact as we would with any other disease
even normal boys are often cruel
a child's moral sense is undeveloped at thirteen
then he suggested that i bathe my eyes with hot water and resume my dignity
which i did
and we had johnnie in
he stoodby preferencethrough the entire interview
the doctor talked to him oh so sensibly and kindly and humanely
john put up the plea that the mouse was a pest and ought to be killed
the doctor replied that the welfare of the human race demanded the sacrifice of many animals for its own good not for revenge but that the sacrifice must be carried out with the least possible hurt to the animal
he explained about the mouse's nervous system and how the poor little creature had no means of defense
it was a cowardly thing to hurt it wantonly
he told john to try to develop imagination enough to look at things from the other person's point of view even if the other person was only a mouse
then he went to the bookcase and took down my copy of burns and told the boy what a great poet he was and how all scotchmen loved his memory
and this is what he wrote about a mouse said sandy turning to the wee sleekit cow'rin timorous beastie which he read and explained to the lad as only a scotchman could
johnnie departed penitent and sandy redirected his professional attention to me
he said i was tired and in need of a change
why not go to the adirondacks for a week
he and betsy and mr witherspoon would make themselves into a committee to run the asylum
you know that's exactly what i was longing to do
i need a shifting of ideas and some pinescented air
my family opened the camp last week and think i'm awful not to join them
they won't understand that when you accept a position like this you can't casually toss it aside whenever you feel like it
but for a few days i can easily manage
my asylum is wound up like an eightday clock and will run until a week from next monday at  pm when my train will return me
then i shall be comfortably settled again before you arrive and with no errant fancies in my brain
meanwhile master john is in a happily chastened frame of mind and body
and i rather suspect that sandy's moralizing had the more force because it was preceded by my pancake turner
but one thing i knowsuzanne estelle is terrified whenever i step into her kitchen
i casually picked up the potatomasher this morning while i was commenting upon last night's oversalty soup and she ran to cover behind the woodshed door
tomorrow at nine i set out on my travels after preparing the way with five telegrams
and oh
you can't imagine how i'm looking forward to being a gay carefree young thing againto canoeing on the lake and tramping in the woods and dancing at the clubhouse
i was in a state of delirium all night long at the prospect
really i hadn't realized how mortally tired i had become of all this asylum scenery
what you need said sandy to me is to get away for a little and sow some wild oats
that diagnosis was positively clairvoyant
i can't think of anything in the world i'd rather do than sow a few wild oats
i'll come back with fresh energy ready to welcome you and a busy summer
as ever  sallie
ps
jimmie and gordon are both going to be up there
how i wish you could join us
a husband is very discommoding
camp mcbride  july 
dear judy  this is to tell you that the mountains are higher than usual the woods greener and the lake bluer
people seem late about coming up this year
the harrimans' camp is the only other one at our end of the lake that is open
the clubhouse is very scantily supplied with dancing men but we have as house guest an obliging young politician who likes to dance so i am not discommoded by the general scarcity
the affairs of the nation and the rearing of orphans are alike delegated to the background while we paddle about among the lily pads of this delectable lake
i look forward with reluctance to  next monday morning when i turn my back on the mountains
the awful thing about a vacation is that the moment it begins your happiness is already clouded by its approaching end
i hear a voice on the veranda asking if sallie is to be found within or without
addio
s   august 
dear judy  back at the john grier reshouldering the burdens of the coming generation
what should meet my eyes upon entering these grounds but john cobden of pancake turner memory wearing a badge upon his sleeve
i turned it to me and read s p c
a
in letters of gold
the doctor during my absence has formed a local branch of the cruelty to animals and made johnnie its president
i hear that yesterday he stopped the workmen on the foundation for the new farm cottage and scolded them severely for whipping their horses up the incline
none of all this strikes any one but me as funny
there's a lot of news but with you due in four days why bother to write
just one delicious bit i am saving for the end
so hold your breath
you are going to receive a thrill on page 
you should hear sadie kate squeal
jane is cutting her hair
instead of wearing it in two tight braids like thisour little colleen will in the future look like this   them pigtails got on my nerves says jane
you can see how much more stylish and becoming the present coiffure is
i think somebody will be wanting to adopt her
only sadie kate is such an independent manly little creature she is eminently fitted by nature to shift for herself
i must save adopting parents for the helpless ones
you should see our new clothes
i can't wait for this assemblage of rosebuds to burst upon you
and you should have seen those blue ginghamed eyes brighten when the new frocks were actually given outthree for each girl all different colors and all perfectly private personal property with the owner's indelible name inside the collar
mrs lippett's lazy system of having each child draw from the wash a promiscuous dress each week was an insult to feminine nature
sadie kate is squealing like a baby pig
i must go to see if jane has by mistake clipped off an ear
jane hasn't
sadie's excellent ears are still intact
she is just squealing on principle the way one does in a dentist's chair under the belief that it is going to hurt the next instant
i really can't think of anything else to write except my newsso here it isand i hope you'll like it
i am engaged to be married
my love to you both
s mcb
the john grier home  november 
dear judy   betsy and i are just back from a giro in our new motor car
it undoubtedly does add to the pleasure of institution life
the car of its own accord turned up long ridge road and stopped before the gates of shadywell
the chains were up and the shutters battened down and the place looked closed and gloomy and rainsoaked
it wore a sort of fall of the house of usher air and didn't in the least resemble the cheerful house that used to greet me hospitably of an afternoon
i hate to have our nice summer ended
it seems as though a section of my life was shut away behind me and the unknown future was pressing awfully close
positively i'd like to postpone that wedding another six months but i'm afraid poor gordon would make too dreadful a fuss
don't think i'm getting wobbly for i'm not
it's just that somehow i need more time to think about it and march is getting nearer every day
i know absolutely that i'm doing the most sensible thing
everybody man or woman is the better for being nicely and appropriately and cheerfully married
but oh dear
oh dear
i do hate upheavals and this is going to be such a worldwithoutend upheaval
sometimes when the day's work is over and i'm tired i haven't the spirit to rise and meet it
and now especially since you've bought shadywell and are going to be here every summer i resent having to leave
next year when i'm far away i'll be consumed with homesickness thinking of all the busy happy times at the john grier with you and betsy and percy and our grumbly scotchman working away cheerfully without me
how can anything ever make up to a mother for the loss of  children
i trust that judy junior stood the journey into town without upsetting her usual poise
i am sending her a bit giftie made partly by myself and chiefly by jane
but two rows i must inform you were done by the doctor
one only gradually plumbs the depths of sandy's nature
after a tenmonths' acquaintance with the man i discover that he knows how to knit an accomplishment he picked up in his boyhood from an old shepherd on the scotch moors
he dropped in three days ago and stayed for tea really in almost his old friendly mood
but he has since stiffened up again to the same man of granite we knew all summer
i've given up trying to make him out
i suppose however that any one might be expected to be a bit down with a wife in an insane asylum
i wish he'd talk about it once
it's awful having such a shadow hovering in the background of your thoughts and never coming out into plain sight
i know that this letter doesn't contain a word of the kind of news that you like to hear
but it's that beastly twilight hour of a damp november day and i'm in a beastly uncheerful mood
i'm awfully afraid that i am developing into a temperamental person and heaven knows gordon can supply all the temperament that one family needs
i don't know where we'll land if i don't preserve my sensibly stolid cheerful nature
have you really decided to go south with jervis
i appreciate your feeling to a slight extent about not wanting to be separated from a husband but it does seem sort of hazardous to me to move so young a daughter to the tropics
the children are playing blind man's buff in the lower corridor
i think i'll have a romp with them and try to be in a more affable mood before resuming my pen
a bientot
sallie
ps
these november nights are pretty cold and we are getting ready to move the camps indoors
our indians are very pampered young savages at present with a double supply of blankets and hotwater bottles
i shall hate to see the camps go they have done a lot for us
our lads will be as tough as canadian trappers when they come in
november 
dear judy  your motherly solicitude is sweet but i didn't mean what i said
of course it's perfectly safe to convey judy junior to the temperately tropical lands that are washed by the caribbean
she'll thrive as long as you don't set her absolutely on top of the equator
and your bungalow shaded by palms and fanned by sea breezes with an ice machine in the back yard and an english doctor across the bay sounds made for the rearing of babies
my objections were all due to the selfish fact that i and the john grier are going to be lonely without you this winter
i really think it's entrancing to have a husband who engages in such picturesque pursuits as financing tropical railroads and developing asphalt lakes and rubber groves and mahogany forests
i wish that gordon would take to life in those picturesque countries i'd be more thrilled by the romantic possibilities of the future
washington seems awfully commonplace compared with honduras and nicaragua and the islands of the caribbean
i'll be down to wave goodby
addio
sallie
november 
dear gordon  judy has gone back to town and is sailing next week for jamaica where she is to make her headquarters while jervis cruises about adjacent waters on these entertaining new ventures of his
couldn't you engage in traffic in the south seas
i think i'd feel pleasanter about leaving my asylum if you had something romantic and adventurous to offer instead
and think how beautiful you'd be in those white linen clothes
i really believe i might be able to stay in love with a man quite permanently if he always dressed in white
you can't imagine how i miss judy
her absence leaves a dreadful hole in my afternoons
can't you run up for a week end soon
i think the sight of you would be very cheering and i'm feeling awfully down of late
you know my dear gordon i like you much better when you're right here before my eyes than when i merely think about you from a distance
i believe you must have a sort of hypnotic influence
occasionally after you've been away a long time your spell wears a little thin
but when i see you it all comes back
you've been away now a long long time so please come fast and bewitch me over again
s   december 
dear judy  do you remember in college when you and i used to plan our favorite futures how we were forever turning our faces southward
and now to think it has really come true and you are there coasting around those tropical isles
did you ever have such a thrill in the whole of your life barring one or two connected with jervis as when you came up on deck in the early dawn and found yourself riding at anchor in the harbor of kingston with the water so blue and the palms so green and the beach so white
i remember when i first woke in that harbor
i felt like a heroine of grand opera surrounded by untruly beautiful painted scenery
nothing in my four trips to europe ever thrilled me like the queer sights and tastes and smells of those three warm weeks seven years ago
and ever since i've panted to get back
when i stop to think about it i can hardly bring myself to swallow our unexciting meals i wish to be dining on curries and tamales and mangos
isn't it funny
you'd think i must have a dash of creole or spanish or some warm blood in me somewhere but i'm nothing on earth but a chilly mixture of english and irish and scotch
perhaps that is why i hear the south calling
the palm dreams of the pine and the pine of the palm
after seeing you off i turned back to new york with an awful wanderthirst gnawing at my vitals
i too wanted to be starting off on my travels in a new blue hat and a new blue suit with a big bunch of violets in my hand
for five minutes i would cheerfully have said goodby forever to poor dear gordon in return for the wide world to wander in
i suppose you are thinking they are not entirely incompatiblegordon and the wide worldbut i don't seem able to get your point of view about husbands
i see marriage as a man must a good sensible workaday institution but awfully curbing to one's liberty
somehow after you're married forever life has lost its feeling of adventure
there aren't any romantic possibilities waiting to surprise you around each corner
the disgraceful truth is that one man doesn't seem quite enough for me
i like the variety of sensation that you get only from a variety of men
i'm afraid i've spent too flirtatious a youth and it isn't easy for me to settle
i seem to have a very wandering pen
to return i saw you off and took the ferry back to new york with a horribly empty feeling
after our intimate gossipy three months together it seems a terrible task to tell you my troubles in tones that will reach to the bottom of the continent
my ferry slid right under the nose of your steamer and i could see you and jervis plainly leaning on the rail
i waved frantically but you never blinked an eyelash
your gaze was fixed in homesick contemplation upon the top of the woolworth building
back in new york i took myself to a department store to accomplish a few trifles in the way of shopping
as i was entering through their revolving doors who should be revolving in the other direction but helen brooks
we had a terrible time meeting as i tried to go back out and she tried to come back in i thought we should revolve eternally
but we finally got together and shook hands and she obligingly helped me choose fifteen dozen pairs of stockings and fifty caps and sweaters and two hundred union suits and then we gossiped all the way up to fiftysecond street where we had luncheon at the women's university club
i always liked helen
she's not spectacular but steady and dependable
will you ever forget the way she took hold of that senior pageant committee and whipped it into shape after mildred had made such a mess of it
how would she do here as a successor to me
i am filled with jealousy at the thought of a successor but i suppose i must face it
when did you last see judy abbott
was helen's first question
fifteen minutes ago said i
she has just set sail for the spanish main with a husband and daughter and nurse and maid and valet and dog
has she a nice husband
none better
and does she still like him
never saw a happier marriage
it struck me that helen looked a trifle bleak and i suddenly remembered all that gossip that marty keene told us last summer so i hastily changed the conversation to a perfectly safe subject like orphans
but later she told me the whole story herself in as detached and impersonal a way as though she were discussing the characters in a book
she has been living alone in the city hardly seeing any one and she seemed low in spirits and glad to talk
poor helen appears to have made an awful mess of her life
i don't know any one who has covered so much ground in such a short space of time
since her graduation she has been married has had a baby and lost him divorced her husband quarreled with her family and come to the city to earn her own living
she is reading manuscript for a publishing house
there seems to have been no reason for her divorce from the ordinary point of view the marriage just simply didn't work
they weren't friends
if he had been a woman she wouldn't have wasted half an hour talking with him
if she had been a man he would have said glad to see you
how are you
and gone on
and yet they married
isn't it dreadful how blind this sex business can make people
she was brought up on the theory that a woman's only legitimate profession is homemaking
when she finished college she was naturally eager to start on her career and henry presented himself
her family scanned him closely and found him perfect in every respectgood family good morals good financial position good looking
helen was in love with him
she had a big wedding and lots of new clothes and dozens of embroidered towels
everything looked propitious
but as they began to get acquainted they didn't like the same books or jokes or people or amusements
he was expansive and social and hilarious and she wasn't
first they bored and then they irritated each other
her orderliness made him impatient and his disorderliness drove her wild
she would spend a day getting closets and bureau drawers in order and in five minutes he would stir them into chaos
he would leave his clothes about for her to pick up and his towels in a messy heap on the bathroom floor and he never scrubbed out the tub
and she on her side was awfully unresponsive and irritatingshe realized it fullyshe got to the point where she wouldn't laugh at his jokes
i suppose most oldfashioned orthodox people would think it awful to break up a marriage on such innocent grounds
it seemed so to me at first but as she went on piling up detail on detail each trivial in itself but making a mountainous total i agreed with helen that it was awful to keep it going
it wasn't really a marriage it was a mistake
so one morning at breakfast when the subject of what they should do for the summer came up she said quite casually that she thought she would go west and get a residence in some state where you could get a divorce for a respectable cause and for the first time in months he agreed with her
you can imagine the outraged feelings of her victorian family
in all the seven generations of their sojourn in america they have never had anything like this to record in the family bible
it all comes from sending her to college and letting her read such dreadful modern people as ellen key and bernard shaw
if he had only got drunk and dragged me about by the hair helen wailed it would have been legitimate but because we didn't actually throw things at each other no one could see any reason for a divorce
the pathetic part of the whole business is that both she and henry were admirably fitted to make some one else happy
they just simply didn't match each other and when two people don't match all the ceremonies in the world can't marry them
saturday morning
i meant to get this letter off two days ago and here i am with volumes written but nothing mailed
we've just had one of those miserable deceiving nightscold and frosty when you go to bed and warm and lifeless when you wake in the dark smothered under a mountain of blankets
by the time i had removed my own extra covers and plumped up my pillow and settled comfortably i thought of those fourteen bundledup babies in the freshair nursery
their socalled night nurse sleeps like a top the whole night through
her name is next on the list to be expunged
so i roused myself again and made a little blanket removing tour and by the time i had finished i was forever awake
it is not often that i pass a nuit blanche but when i do i settle world problems
isn't it funny how much keener your mind is when you are lying awake in the dark
i began thinking about helen brooks and i planned her whole life over again
i don't know why her miserable story has taken such a hold over me
it's a disheartening subject for an engaged girl to contemplate
i keep saying to myself what if gordon and i when we really get acquainted should change our minds about liking each other
the fear grips my heart and wrings it dry
but i am marrying him for no reason in the world except affection
i'm not particularly ambitious
neither his position nor his money ever tempted me in the least
and certainly i am not doing it to find my life work for in order to marry i am having to give up the work that i love
i really do love this work
i go about planning and planning their baby futures feeling that i'm constructing the nation
whatever becomes of me in after life i am sure i'll be the more capable for having had this tremendous experience
and it is a tremendous experience the nearness to humanity that an asylum brings
i am learning so many new things every day that when each saturday night comes i look back on the sallie of last saturday night amazed at her ignorance
you know i am developing a funny old characteristic i am getting to hate change
i don't like the prospect of having my life disrupted
i used to love the excitement of volcanoes but now a high level plateau is my choice in landscape
i am very comfortable where i am
my desk and closet and bureau drawers are organized to suit me and oh i dread unspeakably the thought of the upheaval that is going to happen to me next year
please don't imagine that i don't care for gordon quite as much as any man has a right to be cared for
it isn't that i like him any the less but i am getting to like orphans the more
i just met our medical adviser a few minutes ago as he was emerging from the nurseryallegra is the only person in the institution who is favored by his austere social attentions
he paused in passing to make a polite comment upon the sudden change in the weather and to express the hope that i would remember him to mrs pendleton when i wrote
this is a miserable letter to send off on its travels with scarcely a word of the kind of news that you like to hear
but our bare little orphan asylum up in the hills must seem awfully far away from the palms and orange groves and lizards and tarantulas that you are enjoying
have a good time and don't forget the john grier home  and  sallie
december 
dear judy  your jamaica letter is here and i'm glad to learn that judy junior enjoys traveling
write me every detail about your house and send some photographs so i can see you in it
what fun it must be to have a boat of your own that chugs about those entertaining seas
have you worn all of your eighteen white dresses yet
and aren't you glad now that i made you wait about buying a panama hat till you reached kingston
we are running along here very much as usual without anything exciting to chronicle
you remember little maybelle fuller don't youthe chorus girl's daughter whom our doctor doesn't like
we have placed her out
i tried to make the woman take hattie heaphy insteadthe quiet little one who stole the communion cupbut no indeed
maybelle's eyelashes won the day
after all as poor marie says the chief thing is to be pretty
all else in life depends on that
when i got home last week after my dash to new york i made a brief speech to the children
i told them that i had just been seeing aunt judy off on a big ship and i am embarrassed to have to report that the interestat least on the part of the boysimmediately abandoned aunt judy and centered upon the ship
how many tons of coal did she burn a day
was she long enough to reach from the carriage house to the indian camp
were there any guns aboard and if a privateer should attack her could she hold her own
in case of a mutiny could the captain shoot down anybody he chose and wouldn't he be hanged when he got to shore
i had ignominiously to call upon sandy to finish my speech
i realize that the bestequipped feminine mind in the world can't cope with the peculiar class of questions that originate in a thirteenyear boy's brain
as a result of their seafaring interest the doctor conceived the idea of inviting seven of the oldest and most alert lads to spend the day with him in new york and see with their own eyes an oceanliner
they rose at five yesterday morning caught the  train and had the most wonderful adventure that has happened in all their seven lives
they visited one of the big liners sandy knows the scotch engineer and were conducted from the bottom of the hold to the top of the crow'snest and then had luncheon on board
and after luncheon they visited the aquarium and the top of the singer building and took the subway uptown to spend an hour with the birds of america in their habitats
sandy with great difficulty pried them away from the natural history museum in time to catch the  train
dinner in the diningcar
they inquired with great particularity how much it was costing and when they heard that it was the same no matter how much you ate they drew deep breaths and settled quietly and steadily to the task of not allowing their host to be cheated
the railroad made nothing on that party and all the tables around stopped eating to stare
one traveler asked the doctor if it was a boarding school he had in charge so you can see how the manners and bearing of our lads have picked up
i don't wish to boast but no one would ever have asked such a question concerning seven of mrs lippett's youngsters
are they bound for a reformatory
would have been the natural question after observing the table manners of her offspring
my little band tumbled in toward ten o'clock excitedly babbling a mess of statistics about reciprocating compound engines and watertight bulkheads devilfish and skyscrapers and birds of paradise
i thought i should never get them to bed
and oh but they had had a glorious day
i do wish i could manage breaks in the routine oftener
it gives them a new outlook on life and makes them more like normal children
wasn't it really nice of sandy
but you should have seen that man's behavior when i tried to thank him
he waved me aside in the middle of a sentence and growlingly asked miss snaith if she couldn't economize a little on carbolic acid
the house smelt like a hospital
i must tell you that punch is back with us again entirely renovated as to manners
i am looking for a family to adopt him
i had hoped those two intelligent spinsters would see their way to keeping him forever but they want to travel and they feel he's too consuming of their liberty
i inclose a sketch in colored chalk of your steamer which he has just completed
there is some doubt as to the direction in which it is going it looks as though it might progress backward and end in brooklyn
owing to the loss of my blue pencil our flag has had to adopt the italian colors
the three figures on the bridge are you and jervis and the baby
i am pained to note that you carry your daughter by the back of her neck as if she were a kitten
that is not the way we handle babies in the j g h nursery
please also note that the artist has given jervis his full due in the matter of legs
when i asked punch what had become of the captain he said that the captain was inside putting coal on the fire
punch was terribly impressed as well he might be when he heard that your steamer burned three hundred wagonloads a day and he naturally supposed that all hands had been piped to the stokehole
bow
wow
that's a bark from sing
i told him i was writing to you and he responded instantly
we both send love
yours  sallie
the john grier home  saturday
dear enemy  you were so terribly gruff last night when i tried to thank you for giving my boys such a wonderful day that i didn't have a chance to express half of the appreciation i felt
what on earth is the matter with you sandy
you used to be a tolerably nice manin spots but these last three or four months you have only been nice to other people never to me
we have had from the first a long series of misunderstandings and foolish contretemps but after each one we seemed to reach a solider basis of understanding until i had thought our friendship was on a pretty firm foundation capable of withstanding any reasonable shock
and then came that unfortunate evening last june when you overheard some foolish impolitenesses which i did not in the slightest degree mean and from then on you faded into the distance
really i have felt terribly bad about it and have wanted to apologize but your manner has not been inviting of confidence
it isn't that i have any excuse or explanation to offer i haven't
you know how foolish and silly i am on occasions but you will just have to realize that though i'm flippant and foolish and trivial on top i am pretty solid inside and you've got to forgive the silly part
the pendletons knew that long ago or they wouldn't have sent me up here
i have tried hard to pull off an honest job partly because i wanted to justify their judgment partly because i was really interested in giving the poor little kiddies their share of happiness but mostly i actually believe because i wanted to show you that your first derogatory opinion of me was ill founded
won't you please expunge that unfortunate fifteen minutes at the portecochere last june and remember instead the fifteen hours i spent reading the kallikak family
i would like to feel that we're friends again
sallie mcbride

dear dr macrae  i am in receipt of your calling card with an elevenword answer to my letter on the back
i didn't mean to annoy you by my attentions
what you think and how you behave are really matters of extreme indifference to me
be just as impolite as you choose
s mcb
december 
dear judy  please pepper your letters with stamps inside and out
i have thirty collectors in the family
since you have taken to travel every day about post time an eager group gathers at the gate waiting to snatch any letters of foreign design and by the time the letters reach me they are almost in shreds through the tenacity of rival snatchers
tell jervis to send us some more of those purple pine trees from honduras likewise some green parrots from guatemala
i could use a pint of them
isn't it wonderful to have got these apathetic little things so enthusiastic
my children are getting to be almost like real children
b dormitory started a pillow fight last night of its own accord and though it was very wearing to our scant supply of linen i stood by and beamed and even tossed a pillow myself
last saturday those two desirable friends of percy's spent the whole afternoon playing with my boys
they brought up three rifles and each man took the lead of a camp of indians and passed the afternoon in a bottle shooting contest with a prize for the winning camp
they brought the prize with theman atrocious head of an indian painted on leather
dreadful taste but the men thought it lovely so i admired it with all the ardor i could assume
when they had finished i warmed them up with cookies and hot chocolate and i really think the men enjoyed it as much as the boys they undoubtedly enjoyed it more than i did
i couldn't help being in a feminine twitter all the time the firing was going on for fear somebody would shoot somebody else
but i know that i can't keep twentyfour indians tied to my apron strings and i never could find in the whole wide world three nicer men to take an interest in them
just think of all that healthy exuberant volunteer service going to waste under the asylum's nose
i suppose the neighborhood is full of plenty more of it and i am going to make it my business to dig it out
what i want most are about eight nice pretty sensible young women to come up here one night a week and sit before the fire and tell stories while the chicks pop corn
i do so want to contrive a little individual petting for my babies
you see judy i am remembering your own childhood and am trying hard to fill in the gaps
the trustees' meeting last week went beautifully
the new women are most helpful and only the nice men came
i am happy to announce that the hon
cy wykoff is visiting his married daughter in scranton
i wish she would invite father to live with her permanently
wednesday
i am in the most childish temper with the doctor and for no very definite reason
he keeps along his even unemotional way without paying the slightest attention to anything or anybody
i have swallowed more slights during these last few months than in the whole of my life before and i'm developing the most shockingly revengeful nature
i spend all my spare time planning situations in which he will be terribly hurt and in need of my help and in which  with the utmost callousness will shrug my shoulders and turn away
i am growing into a person entirely foreign to the sweet sunny young thing you used to know
evening
do you realize that i am an authority on the care of dependent children
tomorrow i and other authorities visit officially the hebrew sheltering guardian society's orphan asylum at pleasantville
all that's its name
it's a terribly difficult and roundabout journey from this point involving a daybreak start and two trains and an automobile
but if i'm to be an authority i must live up to the title
i'm keen about looking over other institutions and gleaning as many ideas as possible against our own alterations next year
and this pleasantville asylum is an architectural model
i acknowledge now upon sober reflection that we were wise to postpone extensive building operations until next summer
of course i was disappointed because it meant that i won't be the center of the rippingup and i do so love to be the center of rippingups
but anyway you'll take my advice even though i'm no longer an official head
the two building details we did accomplish are very promising
our new laundry grows better and better it has removed from us that steamy smell so dear to asylums
the farmer's cottage will finally be ready for occupancy next week
all it now lacks is a coat of paint and some doorknobs
but oh dear
oh dear
another bubble has burst
mrs turnfelt for all her comfortable figure and sunny smile hates to have children messing about
they make her nervous
and as for turnfelt himself though industrious and methodical and an excellent gardener still his mental processes are not quite what i had hoped for
when he first came i made him free of the library
he began at the case nearest the door which contains thirtyseven volumes of pansy's works
finally after he had spent four months on pansy i suggested a change and sent him home with huckleberry finn
but he brought it back in a few days and shook his head
he says that after reading pansy anything else seems tame
i am afraid i shall have to look about for some one a little more upandcoming
but at least compared with sterry turnfelt is a scholar
and speaking of sterry he paid us a social call a few days ago in quite a chastened frame of mind
it seems that the rich city feller whose estate he has been managing no longer needs his services and sterry has graciously consented to return to us and let the children have gardens if they wish
i kindly but convincingly declined his offer
friday
i came back from pleasantville last night with a heart full of envy
please mr president i want some gray stucco cottages with luca della robbia figures baked into the front
they have nearly  children there and all sizable youngsters
of course that makes a very different problem from my hundred and seven ranging from babyhood up
but i borrowed from their superintendent several very fancy ideas
i'm dividing my chicks into big and little sisters and brothers each big one to have a little one to love and help and fight for
big sister sadie kate has to see that little sister gladiola always has her hair neatly combed and her stockings pulled up and knows her lessons and gets a touch of petting and her share of candyvery pleasant for gladiola but especially developing for sadie kate
also i am going to start among our older children a limited form of selfgovernment such as we had in college
that will help fit them to go out into the world and govern themselves when they get there
this shoving children into the world at the age of sixteen seems terribly merciless
five of my children are ready to be shoved but i can't bring myself to do it
i keep remembering my own irresponsible silly young self and wondering what would have happened to me had i been turned out to work at the age of sixteen
i must leave you now to write an interesting letter to my politician in washington and it's hard work
what have i to say that will interest a politician
i can't do anything any more but babble about babies and he wouldn't care if every baby was swept from the face of the earth
oh yes he would too
i'm afraid i'm slandering him
babiesat least boy babiesgrow into voters
goodby  sallie
dearest judy  if you expect a cheerful letter from me the day don't read this
the life of man is a wintry road
fog snow rain slush drizzle coldsuch weather
such weather
and you in dear jamaica with the sunshine and the orange blossoms
we've got whooping cough and you can hear us whoop when you get off the train two miles away
we don't know how we got itjust one of the pleasures of institution life
cook has leftin the nightwhat the scotch call a moonlight flitting
i don't know how she got her trunk away but it's gone
the kitchen fire went with her
the pipes are frozen
the plumbers are here and the kitchen floor is all ripped up
one of our horses has the spavin
and to crown all our cheery resourceful percy is down down down in the depths of despair
we have not been quite certain for three days past whether we could keep him from suicide
the girl in detroiti knew she was a heartless little minxwithout so much as going through the formality of sending back his ring has gone and married herself to a man and a couple of automobiles and a yacht
it is the best thing that could ever have happened to percy but it will be a long long time before he realizes it
we have our twentyfour indians back in the house with us
i was sorry to have to bring them in but the shacks were scarcely planned for winter quarters
i have stowed them away very comfortably however thanks to the spacious iron verandas surrounding our new fireescape
it was a happy idea of jervis's having them glassed in for sleeping porches
the babies' sun parlor is a wonderful addition to our nursery
we can fairly see the little tots bloom under the influence of that extra air and sunshine
with the return of the indians to civilized life percy's occupation was ended and he was supposed to remove himself to the hotel
but he didn't want to remove himself
he has got used to orphans he says and he would miss not seeing them about
i think the truth is that he is feeling so miserable over his wrecked engagement that he is afraid to be alone
he needs something to occupy every waking moment out of banking hours
and goodness knows we're glad enough to keep him
he has been wonderful with those youngsters and they need a man's influence
but what on earth to do with the man
as you discovered last summer this spacious chateau does not contain a superabundance of guest rooms
he has finally fitted himself into the doctor's laboratory and the medicines have moved themselves to a closet down the hall
he and the doctor fixed it up between them and if they are willing to be mutually inconvenienced i have no fault to find
mercy
i've just looked at the calendar and it's the eighteenth with christmas only a week away
however shall we finish all our plans in a week
the chicks are making presents for one another and something like a thousand secrets have been whispered in my ear
snow last night
the boys have spent the morning in the woods gathering evergreens and drawing them home on sleds and twenty girls are spending the afternoon in the laundry winding wreaths for the windows
i don't know how we are going to do our washing this week
we were planning to keep the christmas tree a secret but fully fifty children have been boosted up to the carriage house window to take a peep at it and i am afraid the news has spread among the remaining fifty
at your insistence we have sedulously fostered the santa claus myth but it doesn't meet with much credence
why didn't he ever come before
was sadie kate's skeptical question
but santa claus is undoubtedly coming this time
i asked the doctor out of politeness to play the chief role at our christmas tree and being certain ahead of time that he was going to refuse i had already engaged percy as an understudy
but there is no counting on a scotchman
sandy accepted with unprecedented graciousness and i had privately to unengage percy
tuesday
isn't it funny the way some inconsequential people have of pouring out whatever happens to be churning about in their minds at the moment
they seem to have no residue of small talk and are never able to dismiss a crisis in order to discuss the weather
this is apropos of a call i received today
a woman had come to deliver her sister's childsister in a sanatorium for tuberculosis we to keep the child until the mother is cured though i fear from what i hear that will never be
but anyway all the arrangements had been made and the woman had merely to hand in the little girl and retire
but having a couple of hours between trains she intimated a desire to look about so i showed her the kindergarten rooms and the little crib that lily will occupy and our yellow dining room with its frieze of bunnies in order that she might report as many cheerful details as possible to the poor mother
after this as she seemed tired i socially asked her to walk into my parlor and have a cup of tea
doctor macrae being at hand and in a hungry mood a rare state for him he now condescends to a cup of tea with the officers of this institution about twice a month came too and we had a little party
the woman seemed to feel that the burden of entertainment rested upon her and by way of making conversation she told us that her husband had fallen in love with the girl who sold tickets at a moving picture show a painted yellowhaired thing who chewed gum like a cow was her description of the enchantress and he spent all of his money on the girl and never came home except when he was drunk
then he smashed the furniture something awful
an easel with her mother's picture on it that she had had since before she was married he had thrown down just for the pleasure of hearing it crash
and finally she had just got too tired to live so she drank a bottle of swamp root because somebody had told her it was poison if you took it all at once
but it didn't kill her it only made her sick
and he came back and said he would choke her if she ever tried that on him again so she guessed he must still care something for her
all this quite casually while she stirred her tea
i tried to think of something to say but it was a social exigency that left me dumb
but sandy rose to the occasion like a gentleman
he talked to her beautifully and sanely and sent her away actually uplifted
our sandy when he tries can be exceptionally nice particularly to people who have no claim upon him
i suppose it is a matter of professional etiquettepart of a doctor's business to heal the spirit as well as the body
most spirits appear to need it in this world
my caller has left me needing it
i have been wondering ever since what i should do if i married a man who deserted me for a chewing gum girl and who came home and smashed the bricabrac
i suppose judging from the theaters this winter that it is a thing that might happen to any one particularly in the best society
you ought to be thankful you've got jervis
there is something awfully certain about a man like him
the longer i live the surer i am that character is the only thing that counts
but how on earth can you ever tell
men are so good at talking
goodby and a merry christmas to jervis and both judies
s mcb

it would be a pleasant attention if you would answer my letters a little more promptly
john grier home  december 
dear judy  sadie kate has spent the week composing a christmas letter to you and it leaves nothing for me to tell
oh we've had a wonderful time
besides all the presents and games and fancy things to eat we have had hayrides and skating parties and candy pulls
i don't know whether these pampered little orphans will ever settle down again into normal children
many thanks for my six gifts
i like them all particularly the picture of judy junior the tooth adds a pleasant touch to her smile
you'll be glad to hear that i've placed out hattie heaphy in a minister's family and a dear family they are
they never blinked an eyelash when i told them about the communion cup
they've given her to themselves for a christmas present and she went off so happily clinging to her new father's hand
i won't write more now because fifty children are writing thankyou letters and poor aunt judy will be buried beneath her mail when this week's steamer gets in
my love to the pendletons

o dear gordon i have been reading the most upsetting book
i tried to talk some french the other day and not making out very well decided that i had better take my french in hand if i didn't want to lose it entirely
that scotch doctor of ours has mercifully abandoned my scientific education so i have a little time at my own disposal
by some unlucky chance i began with numa roumestan by daudet
it is a terribly disturbing book for a girl to read who is engaged to a politician
read it gordon dear and assiduously train your character away from numa's
it's the story of a politician who is disquietingly fascinating like you
who is adored by all who know him like you
who has a most persuasive way of talking and makes wonderful speeches again like you
he is worshiped by everybody and they all say to his wife what a happy life you must lead knowing so intimately that wonderful man
but he wasn't very wonderful when he came home to heronly when he had an audience and applause
he would drink with every casual acquaintance and be gay and bubbling and expansive and then return morose and sullen and down
joie de rue douleur de maison is the burden of the book
i read it till twelve last night and honestly i didn't sleep for being scared
i know you'll be angry but really and truly gordon dear there's just a touch too much truth in it for my entire amusement
i didn't mean ever to refer again to that unhappy matter of august we talked it all out at the timebut you know perfectly that you need a bit of watching
and i don't like the idea
i want to have a feeling of absolute confidence and stability about the man i marry
i never could live in a state of anxious waiting for him to come home
read numa for yourself and you'll see the woman's point of view
i'm not patient or meek or longsuffering in any way and i'm a little afraid of what i'm capable of doing if i have the provocation
my heart has to be in a thing in order to make it work and oh i do so want our marriage to work
please forgive me for writing all this
i don't mean that i really think you'll be a joy of the street and sorrow of the home
it's just that i didn't sleep last night and i feel sort of hollow behind the eyes
may the year that's coming bring good counsel and happiness and tranquillity to both of us
as ever  s  january 
dear judy  something terribly sort of queer has happened and positively i don't know whether it did happen or whether i dreamed it
i'll tell you from the beginning and i think it might be as well if you burned this letter it's not quite proper for jervis's eyes
you remember my telling you the case of thomas kehoe whom we placed out last june
he had an alcoholic heredity on both sides and as a baby seems to have been fattened on beer instead of milk
he entered the john grier at the age of nine and twice according to his record in the doomsday book he managed to get himself intoxicated once on beer stolen from some workmen and once and thoroughly on cooking brandy
you can see with what misgivings we placed him out
but we warned the family hardworking temperate farming people and hoped for the best
yesterday the family telegraphed that they could keep him no longer
would i please meet him on the six o'clock train
turnfelt met the six o'clock train
no boy
i sent a night message telling of his nonarrival and asking for particulars
i stayed up later than usual last night putting my desk in order andsort of making up my mind to face the new year
toward twelve i suddenly realized that the hour was late and that i was very tired
i had begun getting ready for bed when i was startled by a banging on the front door
i stuck my head out of the window and demanded who was there
tommy kehoe said a very shaky voice
i went down and opened the door and that lad sixteen years old tumbled in dead drunk
thank heaven
percy witherspoon was within call and not away off in the indian camp
i roused him and together we conveyed thomas to our guest room the only decently isolated spot in the building
then i telephoned for the doctor who i am afraid had already had a long day
he came and we put in a pretty terrible night
it developed afterward that the boy had brought along with his luggage a bottle of liniment belonging to his employer
it was made half of alcohol and half of witch hazel and thomas had refreshed his journey with this
he was in such shape that positively i didn't think we'd pull him throughand i hoped we wouldn't
if i were a physician i'd let such cases gently slip away for the good of society but you should have seen sandy work
that terrible lifesaving instinct of his was aroused and he fought with every inch of energy he possessed
i made black coffee and helped all i could but the details were pretty messy and i left the two men to deal with him alone and went back to my room
but i didn't attempt to go to bed i was afraid they might be wanting me again
toward four o'clock sandy came to my library with word that the boy was asleep and that percy had moved up a cot and would sleep in his room the rest of the night
poor sandy looked sort of ashen and haggard and done with life
as i looked at him i thought about how desperately he worked to save others and never saved himself and about that dismal home of his with never a touch of cheer and the horrible tragedy in the background of his life
all the rancor i've been saving up seemed to vanish and a wave of sympathy swept over me
i stretched my hand out to him he stretched his out to me
and suddenlyi don't knowsomething electric happened
in another moment we were in each other's arms
he loosened my hands and put me down in the big armchair
my god
sallie do you think i'm made of iron
he said and walked out
i went to sleep in the chair and when i woke the sun was shining in my eyes and jane was standing over me in amazed consternation
this morning at eleven he came back looked me coldly in the eye without so much as the flicker of an eyelash and told me that thomas was to have hot milk every two hours and that the spots in maggie peters's throat must be watched
here we are back on our old standing and positively i don't know but what i dreamed that one minute in the night
but it would be a piquant situation wouldn't it if sandy and i should discover that we were falling in love with each other he with a perfectly good wife in the insane asylum and i with an outraged fiance in washington
i don't know but what the wisest thing for me to do is to resign at once and take myself home where i can placidly settle down to a few months of embroidering s mcb on tablecloths like any other respectable engaged girl
i repeat very firmly that this letter isn't for jervis's consumption
tear it into little pieces and scatter them in the caribbean
s    january 
dear gordon  you are right to be annoyed
i know i'm not a satisfactory love letter writer
i have only to glance at the published correspondence of elizabeth barrett and robert browning to realize that the warmth of my style is not up to standard
but you know alreadyyou have known a long timethat i am not a very emotional person
i suppose i might write a lot of such things as every waking moment you are in my thoughts
my dear boy i only live when you are near
but it wouldn't be absolutely true
you don't fill all my thoughts  orphans do that
and i really am quite comfortably alive whether you are here or not
i have to be natural
you surely don't want me to pretend more desolation than i feel
but i do love to see youyou know that perfectlyand i am disappointed when you can't come
i fully appreciate all your charming qualities but my dear boy i can't be sentimental on paper
i am always thinking about the hotel chambermaid who reads the letters you casually leave on your bureau
you needn't expostulate that you carry them next your heart for i know perfectly well that you don't
forgive me for that last letter if it hurt your feelings
since i came to this asylum i am extremely touchy on the subject of drink
you would be too if you had seen what i have seen
several of my chicks are the sad result of alcoholic parents and they are never going to have a fair chance all their lives
you can't look about a place like this without aye keeping up a terrible thinking
you are right i am afraid about its being a woman's trick to make a great show of forgiving a man and then never letting him hear the end of it
well gordon i positively don't know what the word forgiving means
it can't include forgetting for that is a physiological process and does not result from an act of the will
we all have a collection of memories that we would happily lose but somehow those are just the ones that insist upon sticking
if forgiving means promising never to speak of a thing again i can doubtless manage that
but it isn't always the wisest way to shut an unpleasant memory inside you
it grows and grows and runs all through you like a poison
oh dear
i really didn't mean to be saying all this
i try to be the cheerful carefree and somewhat lightheaded sallie you like best but i've come in touch with a great deal of realness during this last year and i'm afraid i've grown into a very different person from the girl you fell in love with
i'm no longer a gay young thing playing with life
i know it pretty thoroughly now and that means that i can't be always laughing
i know this is another beastly uncheerful letteras bad as the last and maybe worsebut if you knew what we've just been through
a boysixteenof unspeakable heredity has nearly poisoned himself with a disgusting mixture of alcohol and witch hazel
we have been working three days over him and are just sure now that he is going to recuperate sufficiently to do it again
it's a gude warld but they're ill that's in 't
please excuse that scotchit slipped out
please excuse everything
sallie
january 
dear judy  i hope my two cablegrams didn't give you too terrible a shock
i would have waited to let the first news come by letter with a chance for details but i was so afraid you might hear it in some indirect way
the whole thing is dreadful enough but no lives were lost and only one serious accident
we can't help shuddering at the thought of how much worse it might have been with over a hundred sleeping children in this firetrap of a building
that new fire escape was absolutely useless
the wind was blowing toward it and the flames simply enveloped it
we saved them all by the center stairsbut i'll begin at the beginning and tell the whole story
it had rained all day friday thanks to a merciful providence and the roofs were thoroughly soaked
toward night it began to freeze and the rain turned to sleet
by ten o'clock when i went to bed the wind was blowing a terrible gale from the northwest and everything loose about the building was banging and rattling
about two o'clock i suddenly started wide awake with a bright light in my eyes
i jumped out of bed and ran to the window
the carriage house was a mass of flames and a shower of sparks was sweeping over our eastern wing
i ran to the bathroom and leaned out of the window
i could see that the roof over the nursery was already blazing in half a dozen places
well my dear my heart just simply didn't beat for as much as a minute
i thought of those seventeen babies up under that roof and i couldn't swallow
i finally managed to get my shaking knees to work again and i dashed back to the hall grabbing my automobile coat as i ran
i drummed on betsy's and miss matthews' and miss snaith's doors just as mr witherspoon who had also been wakened by the light came tumbling upstairs three steps at a time struggling into an overcoat as he ran
get all the children down to the dining room babies first i gasped
i'll turn in the alarm
he dashed on up to the third floor while i ran to the telephoneand oh i thought i'd never get central
she was sound asleep
the john grier home is burning
turn in the fire alarm and rouse the village
give me  i said
in one second i had the doctor
maybe i wasn't glad to hear his cool unexcited voice
we're on fire
i cried
come quick and bring all the men you can
i'll be there in fifteen minutes
fill the bathtubs with water and put in blankets
and he hung up
i dashed back to the hall
betsy was ringing our fire bell and percy had already routed out his indian tribes in dormitories b and c  our first thought was not to stop the fire but to get the children to a place of safety
we began in g and went from crib to crib snatching a baby and a blanket and rushing them to the door and handing them out to the indians who lugged them downstairs
both g and f were full of smoke and the children so dead asleep that we couldn't rouse them to a walking state
many times during the next hour did i thank providenceand percy witherspoonfor those vociferous fire drills we have suffered weekly
the twentyfour oldest boys under his direction never lost their heads for a second
they divided into four tribes and sprang to their posts like little soldiers
two tribes helped in the work of clearing the dormitories and keeping the terrified children in order
one tribe worked the hose from the cupola tank until the firemen came and the rest devoted themselves to salvage
they spread sheets on the floor dumped the contents of lockers and bureau drawers into them and bundled them down the stairs
all of the extra clothes were saved except those the children had actually been wearing the day before and most of the staff's things
but clothes beddingeverything belonging to g and f went
the rooms were too full of smoke to make it safe to enter after we had got out the last child
by the time the doctor arrived with luellen and two neighbors he had picked up we were marching the last dormitory down to the kitchen the most remote corner from the fire
the poor chicks were mainly barefooted and wrapped in blankets
we told them to bring their clothes when we wakened them but in their fright they thought only of getting out
by this time the halls were so full of smoke we could scarcely breathe
it looked as though the whole building would go though the wind was blowing away from my west wing
another automobile full of retainers from knowltop came up almost immediately and they all fell to fighting the fire
the regular fire department didn't come for ten minutes after that
you see they have only horses and we are three miles out and the roads pretty bad
it was a dreadful night cold and sleety and such a wind blowing that you could scarcely stand up
the men climbed out on the roof and worked in their stocking feet to keep from slipping off
they beat out the sparks with wet blankets and chopped and squirted that tankful of water and behaved like heroes
the doctor meanwhile took charge of the children
our first thought was to get them away to a place of safety for if the whole building should go we couldn't march them out of doors into that awful wind with only their night clothes and blankets for protection
by this time several more automobiles full of men had come and we requisitioned the cars
knowltop had providentially been opened for the week end in order to entertain a house party in honor of the old gentleman's sixtyseventh birthday
he was one of the first to arrive and he put his entire place at our disposal
it was the nearest refuge and we accepted it instantaneously
we bundled our twenty littlest tots into cars and ran them down to the house
the guests who were excitedly dressing in order to come to the fire received the chicks and tucked them away into their own beds
this pretty well filled up all the available house room but mr reimer mr knowltop's family name has just built a big new stucco barn with a garage hitched to it all nicely heated and ready for us
after the babies were disposed of in the house those helpful guests got to work and fixed the barn to receive the next older kiddies
they covered the floor with hay and spread blankets and carriage robes over it and bedded down thirty of the children in rows like little calves
miss matthews and a nurse went with them administered hot milk all around and within half an hour the tots were sleeping as peacefully as in their little cribs
but meanwhile we at the house were having sensations
the doctor's first question upon arrival had been  you've counted the children
you know they're all here
we've made certain that every dormitory was empty before we left it i replied
you see they couldn't be counted in that confusion
twenty or so of the boys were still in the dormitories working under percy witherspoon to save clothing and furniture and the older girls were sorting over bushels of shoes and trying to fit them to the little ones who were running about underfoot and wailing dismally
well after we had loaded and despatched about seven car loads of children the doctor suddenly called out  where's allegra
there was a horrified silence
no one had seen her
and then miss snaith stood up and shrieked
betsy took her by the shoulders and shook her into coherence
it seems that she had thought allegra was coming down with a cough and in order to get her out of the cold had moved her crib from the fresh air nursery into the store roomand then forgotten it
well my dear you know where the store room is
we simply stared at one another with white faces
by this time the whole east wing was gutted and the thirdfloor stairs in flames
there didn't seem a chance that the child was still alive
the doctor was the first to move
he snatched up a wet blanket that was lying in a soppy pile on the floor of the hall and sprang for the stairs
we yelled to him to come back
it simply looked like suicide but he kept on and disappeared into the smoke
i dashed outside and shouted to the firemen on the roof
the store room window was too little for a man to go through and they hadn't opened it for fear of creating a draft
i can't describe what happened in the next agonizing ten minutes
the thirdfloor stairs fell in with a crash and a burst of flame about five seconds after the doctor passed over them
we had given him up for lost when a shout went up from the crowd on the lawn and he appeared for an instant at one of those dormer windows in the attic and called for the firemen to put up a ladder
then he disappeared and it seemed to us that they'd never get that ladder in place but they finally did and two men went up
the opening of the window had created a draft and they were almost overpowered by the volume of smoke that burst out at the top
after an eternity the doctor appeared again with a white bundle in his arms
he passed it out to the men and then he staggered back and dropped out of sight
i don't know what happened for the next few minutes i turned away and shut my eyes
somehow or other they got him out and halfway down the ladder and then they let him slip
you see he was unconscious from all the smoke he'd swallowed and the ladder was slippery with ice and terribly wobbly
anyway when i looked again he was lying in a heap on the ground with the crowd all running and somebody yelling to give him air
they thought at first he was dead
but dr metcalf from the village examined him and said his leg was broken and two ribs and that aside from that he seemed whole
he was still unconscious when they put him on two of the baby mattresses that had been thrown out of the windows and laid him in the wagon that brought the ladders and started him home
and the rest of us left behind kept right on with the work as though nothing had happened
the queer thing about a calamity like this is that there is so much to be done on every side that you don't have a moment to think and you don't get any of your values straightened out until afterward
the doctor without a moment's hesitation had risked his life to save allegra
it was the bravest thing i ever saw and yet the whole business occupied only fifteen minutes out of that dreadful night
at the time it was just an incident
and he saved allegra
she came out of that blanket with rumpled hair and a look of pleased surprise at the new game of peekaboo
she was smiling
the child's escape was little short of a miracle
the fire had started within three feet of her wall but owing to the direction of the wind it had worked away from her
if miss snaith had believed a little more in fresh air and had left the window open the fire would have eaten back
but fortunately miss snaith does not believe in fresh air and no such thing happened
if allegra had gone i never should have forgiven myself for not letting the bretlands take her and i know that sandy wouldn't
despite all the loss i can't be anything but happy when i think of the two horrible tragedies that have been averted
for seven minutes while the doctor was penned in that blazing third floor i lived through the agony of believing them both gone and i start awake in the night trembling with horror
but i'll try to tell you the rest
the firemen and the volunteersparticularly the chauffeur and stablemen from knowltopworked all night in an absolute frenzy
our newest negro cook who is a heroine in her own right went out and started the laundry fire and made up a boilerful of coffee
it was her own idea
the noncombatants served it to the firemen when they relieved one another for a few minutes' rest and it helped
we got the remainder of the children off to various hospitable houses except the older boys who worked all night as well as any one
it was absolutely inspiring to see the way this entire township turned out and helped
people who haven't appeared to know that the asylum existed came in the middle of the night and put their whole houses at our disposal
they took the children in gave them hot baths and hot soup and tucked them into bed
and so far as i can make out not one of my one hundred and seven chicks is any the worse for hopping about on drenched floors in their bare feet not even the whooping cough cases
it was broad daylight before the fire was sufficiently under control to let us know just what we had saved
i will report that my wing is entirely intact though a little smoky and the main corridor is pretty nearly all right up to the center staircase after that everything is charred and drenched
the east wing is a blackened roofless shell
your hated ward f dear judy is gone forever
i wish that you could obliterate it from your mind as absolutely as it is obliterated from the earth
both in substance and in spirit the old john grier is done for
i must tell you something funny
i never saw so many funny things in my life as happened through that night
when everybody there was in extreme negligee most of the men in pajamas and ulsters and all of them without collars the hon
cyrus wykoff put in a tardy appearance arrayed as for an afternoon tea
he wore a pearl scarf pin and white spats
but he really was extremely helpful
he put his entire house at our disposal and i turned over to him miss snaith in a state of hysterics and her nerves so fully occupied him that he didn't get in our way the whole night through
i can't write any more details now i've never been so rushed in the whole of my life
i'll just assure you that there's no slightest reason for you to cut your trip short
five trustees were on the spot early saturday morning and we are all working like mad to get affairs into some semblance of order
our asylum at the present moment is scattered over the entire township but don't be unduly anxious
we know where all the children are
none of them is permanently mislaid
i didn't know that perfect strangers could be so kind
my opinion of the human race has gone up
i haven't seen the doctor
they telegraphed to new york for a surgeon who set his leg
the break was pretty bad and will take time
they don't think there are any internal injuries though he is awfully battered up
as soon as we are allowed to see him i will send more detailed particulars
i really must stop if i am to catch tomorrow's steamer
goodby
don't worry
there are a dozen silver linings to this cloud that i'll write about tomorrow
sallie
good heavens
here comes an automobile with j f bretland in it
the john grier home  january 
dear judy  listen to this
j f bretland read about our fire in a new york paper i will say that the metropolitan press made the most of details and he posted up here in a twitter of anxiety
his first question as he tumbled across our blackened threshold was  is allegra safe
yes said i
thank god
he cried and dropped into a chair
this is no place for children he said severely and i have come to take her home
i want the boys too he added hastily before i had a chance to speak
my wife and i have talked it over and we have decided that since we are going to the trouble of starting a nursery we might as well run it for three as for one
i led him up to my library where our little family has been domiciled since the fire and ten minutes later when i was called down to confer with the trustees i left j f bretland with his new daughter on his knee and a son leaning against each arm the proudest father in the united states
so you see our fire has accomplished one thing those three children are settled for life
it is almost worth the loss
but i don't believe i told you how the fire started
there are so many things i haven't told you that my arm aches at the thought of writing them all
sterry we have since discovered was spending the week end as our guest
after a bibulous evening passed at jack's place he returned to our carriage house climbed in through a window lighted a candle made himself comfortable and dropped asleep
he must have forgotten to put out the candle anyway the fire happened and sterry just escaped with his life
he is now in the town hospital bathed in sweet oil and painfully regretting his share in our troubles
i am pleased to learn that our insurance was pretty adequate so the money loss won't be so tremendous after all
as for other kinds of loss there aren't any
actually nothing but gain so far as i can make out barring of course our poor smashedup doctor
everybody has been wonderful i didn't know that so much charity and kindness existed in the human race
did i ever say anything against trustees
i take it back
four of them posted up from new york the morning after the fire and all of the local people have been wonderful
even the hon
cy has been so occupied in remaking the morals of the five orphans quartered upon him that he hasn't caused any trouble at all
the fire occurred early saturday morning and sunday the ministers in all the churches called for volunteers to accept in their houses one or two children as guests for three weeks until the asylum could get its plant into working order again
it was inspiring to see the response
every child was disposed of within half an hour
and consider what that means for the future every one of those families is going to take a personal interest in this asylum from now on
also consider what it means for the children
they are finding out how a real family lives and this is the first time that dozens of them have ever crossed the threshold of a private house
as for more permanent plans to take us through the winter listen to all this
the country club has a caddies' clubhouse which they don't use in winter and which they have politely put at our disposal
it joins our land on the back and we are fitting it up for fourteen children with miss matthews in charge
our dining room and kitchen still being intact they will come here for meals and school returning home at night all the better for half a mile walk
the pavilion on the links we are calling it
then that nice motherly mrs wilson next door to the doctor'sshe who has been so efficient with our little lorettahas agreed to take in five more at four dollars a week each
i am leaving with her some of the most promising older girls who have shown housekeeping instincts and would like to learn cooking on a decently small scale
mrs wilson and her husband are such a wonderful couple thrifty and industrious and simple and loving i think it would do the girls good to observe them
a training class in wifehood
i told you about the knowltop people on the east of us who took in fortyseven youngsters the night of the fire and how their entire house party turned themselves into emergency nursemaids
we relieved them of thirtysix the next day but they still have eleven
did i ever call mr knowltop a crusty old curmudgeon
i take it back
i beg his pardon
he's a sweet lamb
now in the time of our need what do you think that blessed man has done
he has fitted up an empty tenant house on the estate for our babies has himself engaged an english trained baby nurse to take charge and furnishes them with the superior milk from his own model dairy
he says he has been wondering for years what to do with that milk
he can't afford to sell it because he loses four cents on every quart
the twelve older girls from dormitory a i am putting into the farmer's new cottage
the poor turnfelts who had occupied it just two days are being shoved on into the village
but they wouldn't be any good in looking after the children and i need their room
three or four of these girls have been returned from foster homes as intractable and they require pretty efficient supervision
so what do you think i've done
telegraphed to helen brooks to chuck the publishers and take charge of my girls instead
you know she will be wonderful with them
she accepted provisionally
poor helen has had enough of this irrevocable contract business she wants everything in life to be on trial
for the older boys something particularly nice has happened we have received a gift of gratitude from j f bretland
he went down to thank the doctor for allegra
they had a long talk about the needs of the institution and j f b came back and gave me a check for  to build the indian camps on a substantial scale
he and percy and the village architect have drawn up plans and in two weeks we hope the tribes will move into winter quarters
what does it matter if my one hundred and seven children have been burned out since they live in such a kindhearted world as this
friday
i suppose you are wondering why i don't vouchsafe some details about the doctor's condition
i can't give any firsthand information since he won't see me
however he has seen everybody except mebetsy allegra mrs livermore mr bretland percy various trustees
they all report that he is progressing as comfortably as could be expected with two broken ribs and a fractured fibula
that i believe is the professional name of the particular leg bone he broke
he doesn't like to have a fuss made over him and he won't pose gracefully as a hero
i myself as grateful head of this institution called on several different occasions to present my official thanks but i was invariably met at the door with word that he was sleeping and did not wish to be disturbed
the first two times i believed mrs mcgurk after thatwell i know our doctor
so when it came time to send our little maid to prattle her unconscious goodbys to the man who had saved her life i despatched her in charge of betsy
i haven't an idea what is the matter with the man
he was friendly enough last week but now if i want an opinion from him i have to send percy to extract it
i do think that he might see me as the superintendent of the asylum even if he doesn't wish our acquaintance to be on a personal basis
there is no doubt about it our sandy is scotch
later
it is going to require a fortune in stamps to get this letter to jamaica but i do want you to know all the news and we have never had so many exhilarating things happen since  when we were founded
this fire has given us such a shock that we are going to be more alive for years to come
i believe that every institution ought to be burned to the ground every twentyfive years in order to get rid of oldfashioned equipment and obsolete ideas
i am superlatively glad now that we didn't spend jervis's money last summer it would have been intensively tragic to have had that burn
i don't mind so much about john grier's since he made it in a patent medicine which i hear contained opium
as to the remnant of us that the fire left behind it is already boarded up and covered with tarpaper and we are living along quite comfortably in our portion of a house
it affords sufficient room for the staff and the children's dining room and kitchen and more permanent plans can be made later
do you perceive what has happened to us
the good lord has heard my prayer and the john grier home is a cottage institution
i am  the busiest person north of the equator  s mcbride
the john grier home  january 
dear gordon  please please behave yourself and don't make things harder than they are
it's absolutely out of the question for me to give up the asylum this instant
you ought to realize that i can't abandon my chicks just when they are so terribly in need of me
neither am i ready to drop this blasted philanthropy
you can see how your language looks in my handwriting
you have no cause to worry
i am not overworking
i am enjoying it never was so busy and happy in my life
the papers made the fire out much more lurid than it really was
that picture of me leaping from the roof with a baby under each arm was overdrawn
one or two of the children have sore throats and our poor doctor is in a plaster cast
but we're all alive thank heaven
and are going to pull through without permanent scars
i can't write details now i'm simply rushed to death
and don't comeplease
later when things have settled just a little you and i must have a talk about you and me but i want time to think about it first
s   january 
dear judy  helen brooks is taking hold of those fourteen fractious girls in a most masterly fashion
the job is quite the toughest i had to offer and she likes it
i think she is going to be a valuable addition to our staff
and i forgot to tell you about punch
when the fire occurred those two nice women who kept him all summer were on the point of catching a train for californiaand they simply tucked him under their arms along with their luggage and carried him off
so punch spends the winter in pasadena and i rather fancy he is theirs for good
do you wonder that i am in an exalted mood over all these happenings
later
poor bereaved percy has just been spending the evening with me because i am supposed to understand his troubles
why must i be supposed to understand everybody's troubles
it's awfully wearing to be pouring out sympathy from an empty heart
the poor boy at present is pretty low but i rather suspectwith betsy's aidthat he will pull through
he is just on the edge of falling in love with betsy but he doesn't know it
he's in the stage now where he's sort of enjoying his troubles
he feels himself a tragic hero a man who has suffered deeply
but i notice that when betsy is about he offers cheerful assistance in whatever work is toward
gordon telegraphed today that he is coming tomorrow
i am dreading the interview for i know we are going to have an altercation
he wrote the day after the fire and begged me to chuck the asylum and get married immediately and now he's coming to argue it out
i can't make him understand that a job involving the happiness of one hundred or so children can't be chucked with such charming insouciance
i tried my best to keep him away but like the rest of his sex he's stubborn
oh dear i don't know what's ahead of us
i wish i could glance into next year for a moment
the doctor is still in his plaster cast but i hear is doing well after a grumbly fashion
he is able to sit up a little every day and to receive a carefully selected list of visitors
mrs mcgurk sorts them out at the door and repudiates the ones she doesn't like
goodby
i'd write some more but i'm so sleepy that my eyes are shutting on me
the idiom is sadie kate's
i must go to bed and get some sleep against the one hundred and seven troubles of tomorrow
with love to the pendletons  s mcb
january 
dear judy  this letter has nothing to do with the john grier home
it's merely from sallie mcbride
do you remember when we read huxley's letters our senior year
that book contained a phrase which has stuck in my memory ever since there is always a cape horn in one's life that one either weathers or wrecks oneself on
it's terribly true and the trouble is that you can't always recognize your cape horn when you see it
the sailing is sometimes pretty foggy and you're wrecked before you know it
i've been realizing of late that i have reached the cape horn of my own life
i entered upon my engagement to gordon honestly and hopefully but little by little i've grown doubtful of the outcome
the girl he loves is not the me i want to be
it's the me i've been trying to grow away from all this last year
i'm not sure she ever really existed
gordon just imagined she did
anyway she doesn't exist any more and the only fair course both to him and to myself was to end it
we no longer have any interests in common we are not friends
he doesn't comprehend it he thinks that i am making it up that all i have to do is to take an interest in his life and everything will turn out happily
of course i do take an interest when he's with me
i talk about the things he wants to talk about and he doesn't know that there's a whole part of methe biggest part of methat simply doesn't meet him at any point
i pretend when i am with him
i am not myself and if we were to live together in constant daily intercourse i'd have to keep on pretending all my life
he wants me to watch his face and smile when he smiles and frown when he frowns
he can't realize that i'm an individual just as much as he is
i have social accomplishments
i dress well i'm spectacular i would be an ideal hostess in a politician's householdand that's why he likes me
anyway i suddenly saw with awful distinctness that if i kept on i'd be in a few years where helen brooks is
she's a far better model of married life for me to contemplate just this moment than you dear judy
i think that such a spectacle as you and jervis is a menace to society
you look so happy and peaceful and companionable that you induce a defenseless onlooker to rush off and snap up the first man she meetsand he's always the wrong man
anyway gordon and i have quarreled definitely and finally
i should rather have ended without a quarrel but considering his temperamentand mine too i must confesswe had to go off in a big smoky explosion
he came yesterday afternoon after i'd written him not to come and we went walking over knowltop
for three and a half hours we paced back and forth over that windy moor and discussed ourselves to the bottommost recesses of our beings
no one can ever say the break came through misunderstanding each other
it ended by gordon's going never to return
as i stood there at the end and watched him drop out of sight over the brow of the hill and realized that i was free and alone and my own master well judy such a sense of joyous relief of freedom swept over me
i can't tell you i don't believe any happily married person could ever realize how wonderfully beautifully alone i felt
i wanted to throw my arms out and embrace the whole waiting world that belonged suddenly to me
oh it is such a relief to have it settled
i faced the truth the night of the fire when i saw the old john grier go and realized that a new john grier would be built in its place and that i wouldn't be here to do it
a horrible jealousy clutched at my heart
i couldn't give it up and during those agonizing moments while i thought we had lost our doctor i realized what his life meant and how much more significant than gordon's
and i knew then that i couldn't desert him
i had to go on and carry out all of the plans we made together
i don't seem to be telling you anything but a mess of words i am so full of such a mess of crowding emotions
i want to talk and talk and talk myself into coherence
but anyway i stood alone in the winter twilight and i took a deep breath of clear cold air and i felt beautifully wonderfully electrically free
and then i ran and leaped and skipped down the hill and across the pastures toward our iron confines and i sang to myself
oh it was a scandalous proceeding when according to all precedent i should have gone trailing home with a broken wing
i never gave one thought to poor gordon who was carrying a broken bruised betrayed heart to the railroad station
as i entered the house i was greeted by the joyous clatter of the children trooping to their supper
they were suddenly mine and lately as my doom became more and more imminent they had seemed fading away into little strangers
i seized the three nearest and hugged them hard
i have suddenly found such new life and exuberance i feel as though i had been released from prison and were free
i feeloh i'll stopi just want you to know the truth
don't show jervis this letter but tell him what's in it in a decently subdued and mournful fashion
it's midnight now and i'm going to try to go to sleep
it's wonderful not to be going to marry some one you don't want to marry
i'm glad of all these children's needs i'm glad of helen brooks and yes of the fire and everything that has made me see clearly
there's never been a divorce in my family and they would have hated it
i know i'm horribly egotistical and selfish i ought to be thinking of poor gordon's broken heart
but really it would just be a pose if i pretended to be very sorrowful
he'll find some one else with just as conspicuous hair as mine who will make just as effective a hostess and who won't be bothered by any of these damned modern ideas about public service and woman's mission and all the rest of the tomfoolery the modern generation of women is addicted to
i paraphrase and soften our young man's heartbroken utterances
goodby dear people
how i wish i could stand with you on your beach and look across the blue blue sea
i salute the spanish main
addio

january 
dear dr macrae  i wonder if this note will be so fortunate as to find you awake
perhaps you are not aware that i have called four times to offer thanks and consolation in my best bedside manner
i am touched by the news that mrs mcgurk's time is entirely occupied in taking in flowers and jelly and chicken broth donated by the adoring ladies of the parish to the ungracious hero in a plaster cast
i know that you find a cap of homespun more comfortable than a halo but i really do think that you might have regarded me in a different light from the hysterical ladies in question
you and i used to be friends intermittently and though there are one or two details in our past intercourse that might better be expunged still i don't see why we should let them upset our entire relationship
can't we be sensible and expunge them
the fire has brought out such a lot of unexpected kindliness and charity i wish it might bring out a little from you
you see sandy i know you well
you may pose to the world as being gruff and curt and ungracious and scientific and inhuman and s c o t c h but you can't fool me
my newly trained psychological eye has been upon you for ten months and i have applied the binet test
you are really kind and sympathetic and wise and forgiving and big so please be at home the next time i come to see you and we will perform a surgical operation upon time and amputate five months
do you remember the sunday afternoon we ran away and what a nice time we had
it is now the day after that
sallie mcbride
ps
if i condescend to call upon you again please condescend to see me for i assure you i won't try more than once
also i assure you that i won't drip tears on your counterpane or try to kiss your hand as i hear one admiring lady did
the john grier home  thursday
dear enemy  you see i'm feeling very friendly toward you this moment
when i call you macrae i don't like you and when i call you enemy i do
sadie kate delivered your note as an afterthought
and it's a very creditable production for a lefthanded man i thought at first glance it was from punch
you may expect me tomorrow at four and mind you're awake
i'm glad that you think we're friends
really i feel that i've got back something quite precious which i had carelessly mislaid

he sits and holds his cheek like a poor little kiddie
thursday january 
dear judy  those must have been ten terribly incoherent pages i dashed off to you last week
did you respect my command to destroy that letter
i should not care to have it appear in my collected correspondence
i know that my state of mind is disgraceful shocking scandalous but one really can't help the way one feels
it is usually considered a pleasant sensation to be engaged but oh it is nothing compared with the wonderful untrammeled joyous free sensation of being unengaged
i have had a terribly unstable feeling these last few months and now at last i am settled
no one ever looked forward to spinsterhood more thankfully than i
our fire i have come to believe was providential
it was sent from heaven to clear the way for a new john grier
we are already deep in plans for cottages
i favor gray stucco betsy leans to brick and percy halftimber
i don't know what our poor doctor would prefer olive green with a mansard roof appears to be his taste
with ten different kitchens to practice in won't our children learn how to cook
i am already looking about for ten loving house mothers to put in charge
i think in fact i'll search for eleven in order to have one for sandy
he's as pathetically in need of a little mothering as any of the chicks
it must be pretty dispiriting to come home every night to the ministrations of mrs mcgurrk
how i do not like that woman
she has with complacent firmness told me four different times that the dochther was ashleep and not wantin' to be disturbed
i haven't set eyes on him yet and i have just about finished being polite
however i waive judgment until tomorrow at four when i am to pay a short unexciting call of half an hour
he made the appointment himself and if she tells me again that he is ashleep i shall give her a gentle push and tip her over she's very fat and unstable and planting a foot firmly on her stomach pursue my way tranquilly in and up
luellen formerly chauffeur chambermaid and gardener is now also trained nurse
i am eager to see how he looks in a white cap and apron
the mail has just come with a letter from mrs bretland telling how happy they are to have the children
she inclosed their first photographall packed in a governess cart with clifford proudly holding the reins and a groom at the pony's head
how is that for three late inmates of the john grier home
it's all very inspiring when i think of their futures but a trifle sad when i remember their poor father and how he worked himself to death for those three chicks who are going to forget him
the bretlands will do their best to accomplish that
they are jealous of any outside influence and want to make the babies wholly theirs
after all i think the natural way is bestfor each family to produce its own children and keep them
friday
i saw the doctor today
he's a pathetic sight consisting mostly of bandages
somehow or other we got our misunderstandings all made up
isn't it dreadful the way two human beings both endowed with fair powers of speech can manage to convey nothing of their psychological processes to each other
i haven't understood his mental attitude from the first and he even yet doesn't understand mine
this grim reticence that we northern people struggle so hard to maintain
i don't know after all but that the excitable southern safety valve method is the best
but judy such a dreadful thingdo you remember last year when he visited that psychopathic institution and stayed ten days and i made such a silly fuss about it
oh my dear the impossible things i do
he went to attend his wife's funeral
she died there in the institution
mrs mcgurk knew it all the time and might have added it to the rest of her news but she didn't
he told me all about her very sweetly
the poor man for years and years has undergone a terrible strain and i fancy her death is a blessed relief
he confesses that he knew at the time of his marriage that he ought not to marry her he knew all about her nervous instability but he thought being a doctor that he could overcome it and she was beautiful
he gave up his city practice and came to the country on her account
and then after the little girl's birth she went all to pieces and he had to put her away to use mrs mcgurk's phrase
the child is six now a sweet lovely little thing to look at but i judge from what he said quite abnormal
he has a trained nurse with her always
just think of all that tragedy looming over our poor patient good doctor for he is patient despite being the most impatient man that ever lived
thank jervis for his letter
he's a dear man and i'm glad to see him getting his deserts
what fun we are going to have when you get back to shadywell and we lay our plans for a new john grier
i feel as though i had spent this past year learning and am now just ready to begin
we'll turn this into the nicest orphan asylum that ever lived
i'm so absurdly happy at the prospect that i start in the morning with a spring and go about my various businesses singing inside
the john grier home sends its blessing to the two best friends it ever had
addio
sallie
the john grier home  saturday at halfpast six in the morning
my dearest enemy  some day soon something nice is going to happen
weren't you surprised when you woke up this morning and remembered the truth
i was
i couldn't think for about two minutes what made me so happy
it's not light yet but i'm wide awake and excited and having to write to you
i shall despatch this note by the first tobetrusted little orphan who appears and it will go up on your breakfast tray along with your oatmeal
i shall follow very promptly at four o'clock this afternoon
do you think mrs mcgurk will ever countenance the scandal if i stay two hours and no orphan for a chaperon
it was in all good faith sandy that i promised not to kiss your hand or drip tears on the counterpane but i'm afraid i did bothor worse
positively i didn't suspect how much i cared for you till i crossed the threshold and saw you propped up against the pillows all covered with bandages and your hair singed off
you are a sight
if i love you now when fully one third of you is plaster of paris and surgical dressing you can imagine how i'm going to love you when it's all you
but my dear dear robin what a foolish man you are
how should i ever have dreamed all those months that you were caring for me when you acted so abominably s c o t c h
with most men behavior like yours would not be considered a mark of affection
i wish you had just given me a glimmering of an idea of the truth and maybe you would have saved us both a few heartaches
but we mustn't be looking back we must look forward and be grateful
the two happiest things in life are going to be ours a friendly marriage and work that we love
yesterday after leaving you i walked back to the asylum sort of dazed
i wanted to get by myself and think but instead of being by myself i had to have betsy and percy and mrs livermore for dinner already invited and then go down and talk to the children
friday nightsocial evening
they had a lot of new records for the victrola given by mrs livermore and i had to sit politely and listen to them
and my dearyou'll think this funnythe last thing they played was john anderson my jo john and suddenly i found myself crying
i had to snatch up the earnest orphan and hug her hard with my head buried in her shoulder to keep them all from seeing
john anderson my jo john      we clamb the hill thegither      and monie a canty day john      we've had wi' ane anither      now we maun totter down john      but hand in hand we'll go      and sleep thegither at the foot      john anderson my jo
i wonder when we are old and bent and tottery can you and i look back with no regrets on monie a canty day we've had wi' ane anither
it's nice to look forward to isn't ita life of work and play and little daily adventures side by side with somebody you love
i'm not afraid of the future any more
i don't mind growing old with you sandy
time is but the stream i go afishing in
the reason i've grown to love these orphans is because they need me so and that's the reasonat least one of the reasonsi've grown to love you
you're a pathetic figure of a man my dear and since you won't make yourself comfortable you must be made comfortable
we'll build a house on the hillside just beyond the asylumhow does a yellow italian villa strike you or preferably a pink one
anyway it won't be green
and it won't have a mansard roof
and we'll have a big cheerful living room all fireplace and windows and view and no mcgurk
poor old thing
won't she be in a temper and cook you a dreadful dinner when she hears the news
but we won't tell her for a long long timeor anybody else
it's too scandalous a proceeding right on top of my own broken engagement
i wrote to judy last night and with unprecedented selfcontrol i never let fall so much as a hint
i'm growing scotch mysel'
perhaps i didn't tell you the exact truth sandy when i said i hadn't known how much i cared
i think it came to me the night the john grier burned
when you were up under that blazing roof and for the half hour that followed when we didn't know whether or not you would live i can't tell you what agonies i went through
it seemed to me if you did go that i would never get over it all my life that somehow to have let the best friend i ever had pass away with a dreadful chasm of misunderstanding between uswelli couldn't wait for the moment when i should be allowed to see you and talk out all that i have been shutting inside me for five months
and thenyou know that you gave strict orders to keep me out and it hurt me dreadfully
how should i suspect that you really wanted to see me more than any of the others and that it was just that terrible scotch moral sense that was holding you back
you are a very good actor sandy
but my dear if ever in our lives again we have the tiniest little cloud of a misunderstanding let's promise not to shut it up inside ourselves but to talk
last night after they all got offearly i am pleased to say since the chicks no longer live at homei came upstairs and finished my letter to judy and then i looked at the telephone and struggled with temptation
i wanted to call up  and say good night to you
but i didn't dare
i'm still quite respectably bashful
so as the next best thing to talking with you i got out burns and read him for an hour
i dropped asleep with all those scotch love songs running in my head and here i am at daybreak writing them to you
goodby robin lad i lo'e you weel
sallie
