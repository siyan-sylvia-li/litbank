chapter i
the missing heir
uncle you are not looking well to night
i'm not well florence
i sometimes doubt if i shall ever be any better
surely uncle you cannot mean yes my child i have reason to believe that i am nearing the end
i cannot bear to hear you speak so uncle said florence linden in irrepressible agitation
you are not an old man
you are but fifty four
true florence but it is not years only that make a man old
two great sorrows have embittered my life
first the death of my dearly beloved wife and next the loss of my boy harvey
it is long since i have heard you refer to my cousin's loss
i thought you had become reconciled no i do not mean that i thought your regret might be less poignant
i have not permitted myself to speak of it but i have never ceased to think of it day and night
john linden paused sadly then resumed if he had died i might as you say have become reconciled but he was abducted at the age of four by a revengeful servant whom i had discharged from my employment
heaven knows whether he is living or dead but it is impressed upon my mind that he still lives it may be in misery it may be as a criminal while i his unhappy father live on in luxury which i cannot enjoy with no one to care for me florence linden sank impulsively on her knees beside her uncle's chair
don't say that uncle she pleaded
you know that i love you uncle john
and i too uncle
there was a shade of jealousy in the voice of curtis waring as he entered the library through the open door and approaching his uncle pressed his hand
he was a tall dark complexioned man of perhaps thirty five with shifty black eyes and thin lips shaded by a dark mustache
it was not a face to trust
even when he smiled the expression of his face did not soften
yet he could moderate his voice so as to express tenderness and sympathy
he was the son of an elder sister of mr linden while florence was the daughter of a younger brother
both were orphans and both formed a part of mr linden's household and owed everything to his bounty
curtis was supposed to be in some business downtown but he received a liberal allowance from his uncle and often drew upon him for outside assistance
as he stood with his uncle's hand in his he was necessarily brought near florence who instinctively drew a little away with a slight shudder indicating repugnance
slight as it was curtis detected it and his face darkened
john linden looked from one to the other
yes he said i must not forget that i have a nephew and a niece
you are both dear to me but no one can take the place of the boy i have lost
but it is so long ago uncle said curtis
it must be fourteen years
it is fourteen years
and the boy is long since dead
no no
said john linden vehemently
i do not i will not believe it
he still lives and i live only in the hope of one day clasping him in my arms
that is very improbable uncle said curtis in a tone of annoyance
there isn't one chance in a hundred that my cousin still lives
the grave has closed over him long since
the sooner you make up your mind to accept the inevitable the better
the drawn features of the old man showed that the words had a depressing effect upon his mind but florence interrupted her cousin with an indignant protest
how can you speak so curtis
she exclaimed
leave uncle john the hope that he has so long cherished
i have a presentiment that harvey still lives
john linden's face brightened up you too believe it possible florence
he said eagerly
yes uncle
i not only believe it possible but probable
how old would harvey be if he still lived
eighteen nearly a year older than yourself
how strange
i always think of him as a little boy
and i too florence
he rises before me in his little velvet suit as he was when i last saw him with his sweet boyish face in which his mother's looks were reflected
yet if still living interrupted curtis harshly he is a rough street boy perchance serving his time at blackwell's island and a hardened young ruffian whom it would be bitter mortification to recognize as your son
that's the sorrowful part of it said his uncle in a voice of anguish
that is what i most dread
then since even if he were living you would not care to recognize him why not cease to think of him or else regard him as dead
curtis waring have you no heart
demanded florence indignantly
indeed florence you ought to know said curtis sinking his voice into softly modulated accents
i know nothing of it said florence coldly rising from her recumbent position and drawing aloof from curtis
you know that the dearest wish of my heart is to find favor in your eyes
uncle you know my wish and approve of it do you not
yes curtis you and florence are equally dear to me and it is my hope that you may be united
in that case there will be no division of my fortune
it will be left to you jointly
believe me sir said curtis with faltering voice feigning an emotion which he did not feel believe me that i fully appreciate your goodness
i am sure florence joins with me florence can speak for herself said his cousin coldly
my uncle needs no assurance from me
he is always kind and i am always grateful
john linden seemed absorbed in thought
i do not doubt your affection he said and i have shown it by making you my joint heirs in the event of your marriage but it is only fair to say that my property goes to my boy if he still lives
but sir protested curtis is not that likely to create unnecessary trouble
it can never be known and meanwhile you and florence will hold the property in trust
have you so specified in your will
asked curtis
i have made two wills
both are in yonder secretary
by the first the property is bequeathed to you and florence
by the second and later it goes to my lost boy in the event of his recovery
of course you and florence are not forgotten but the bulk of the property goes to harvey
i sincerely wish the boy might be restored to you said curtis but his tone belied his words
believe me the loss of the property would affect me little if you could be made happy by realizing your warmest desire but uncle i think it only the part of a friend to point out to you as i have already done the baselessness of any such expectation
it may be as you say curtis said his uncle with a sigh
if i were thoroughly convinced of it i would destroy the later will and leave my property absolutely to you and florence
no uncle said florence impulsively make no change let the will stand
curtis screened from his uncle's view darted a glance of bitter indignation at florence
is the girl mad
he muttered to himself
must she forever balk me
let it be so for the present then said mr linden wearily
curtis will you ring the bell
i am tired and shall retire to my couch early
let me help you uncle john said florence eagerly
it is too much for your strength my child
i am growing more and more helpless
i too can help said curtis
john linden supported on either side by his nephew and niece left the room and was assisted to his chamber
curtis and florence returned to the library
florence said her cousin my uncle's intentions as expressed to night make it desirable that there should be an understanding between us
take a seat beside me leading her to a sofa and let us talk this matter over
with a gesture of repulsion florence declined the proffered seat and remained standing
as you please she answered coldly
will you be seated
no our interview will be brief
then i will come to the point
uncle john wishes to see us united
it can never be
said florence decidedly
curtis bit his lip in mortification for her tone was cold and scornful
mingled with this mortification was genuine regret for so far as he was capable of loving any one he loved his fair young cousin
you profess to love uncle john and yet you would disappoint his cherished hope
he returned
is it his cherished hope
there is no doubt about it
he has spoken to me more than once on the subject
feeling that his end is near he wishes to leave you in charge of a protector
i can protect myself said florence proudly
you think so
you do not consider the hapless lot of a penniless girl in a cold and selfish world
penniless
repeated florence in an accent of surprise
yes penniless
our uncle's bequest to you is conditional upon your acceptance of my hand
has he said this
asked florence sinking into an armchair with a helpless look
he has told me so more than once returned curtis smoothly
you don't know how near to his heart this marriage is
i know what you would say if the property comes to me i could come to your assistance but i am expressly prohibited from doing so
i have pleaded with my uncle in your behalf but in vain
florence was too clear sighted not to penetrate his falsehood
if my uncle's heart is hardened against me she said i shall be too wise to turn to you
i am to understand then that my choice lies between poverty and a union with you
you have stated it correctly florence
then said florence arising i will not hesitate
i shrink from poverty for i have been reared in luxury but i will sooner live in a hovel or a tenement house interjected curtis with a sneer
yes or a tenement house than become the wife of one i loathe
girl you shall bitterly repent that word
said curtis stung to fury
she did not reply but pale and sorrowful glided from the room to weep bitter tears in the seclusion of her chamber
chapter ii
a stranger visitor
curtis waring followed the retreating form of his cousin with a sardonic smile
she is in the toils
she cannot escape me
he muttered
but and here his brow darkened it vexes me to see how she repels my advances as if i were some loathsome thing
if only she would return my love for i do love her cold as she is i should be happy
can there be a rival
but no
we live so quietly that she has met no one who could win her affection
why can she not turn to me
surely i am not so ill favored and though twice her age i am still a young man
nay it is only a young girl's caprice
she shall yet come to my arms a willing captive
his thoughts took a turn as he arose from his seat and walked over to the secretary
so it is here that the two wills are deposited
he said to himself one making me a rich man the other a beggar
while the last is in existence i am not safe
the boy may be alive and liable to turn up at any moment
if only he were dead or the will destroyed here he made a suggestive pause
he took a bunch of keys from his pocket and tried one after another but without success
he was so absorbed in his work that he did not notice the entrance of a dark browed broad shouldered man dressed in a shabby corduroy suit till the intruder indulged in a short cough intended to draw attention
starting with guilty consciousness curtis turned sharply around and his glance fell on the intruder
who are you
he demanded angrily
and how dare you enter a gentleman's house unbidden
are you the gentleman
asked the intruder with intentional insolence
yes
you own this house
not at present
it is my uncle's
and that secretary pardon my curiosity is his
yes but what business is it of yours
not much
only it makes me laugh to see a gentleman picking a lock
you should leave such business to men like me
you are an insolent fellow
said curtis more embarrassed than he liked to confess for this rough looking man had become possessed of a dangerous secret
i am my uncle's confidential agent and it was on business of his that i wished to open the desk
why not go to him for the key
because he is sick
but pshaw
why should i apologize or give any explanation to you
what can you know of him or me
more perhaps than you suspect said the intruder quietly
then you know perhaps that i am my uncle's heir
don't be too sure of that
look here fellow said curtis thoroughly provoked i don't know who you are nor what you mean but let me inform you that your presence here is an intrusion and the sooner you leave the house the better
i will leave it when i get ready
curtis started to his feet and advanced to his visitor with an air of menace
go at once he exclaimed angrily or i will kick you out of the door
what's the matter with the window
returned the stranger with an insolent leer
that's as you prefer but if you don't leave at once i will eject you
by way of reply the rough visitor coolly seated himself in a luxurious easy chair and looking up into the angry face of waring said oh no you won't
and why not may i ask
said curtis with a feeling of uneasiness for which he could not account
why not
because in that case i should seek an interview with your uncle and tell him what
that his son still lives and that i can restore him to his the face of curtis waring blanched he staggered as if he had been struck and he cried out hoarsely it is a lie
it is the truth begging your pardon
do you mind my smoking
and he coolly produced a common clay pipe filled and lighted it
who are you
asked curtis scanning the man's features with painful anxiety
have you forgotten tim bolton
are you tim bolton
faltered curtis
yes but you don't seem glad to see me
i thought you were in australia
so i was three years since
then i got homesick and came back to new york
you have been here three years
yes chuckled bolton
you didn't suspect it did you
where
asked curtis in a hollow voice
i keep a saloon on the bowery
there's my card
call around when convenient
curtis was about to throw the card into the grate but on second thought dropped it into his pocket
and the boy
he asked slowly
is alive and well
he hasn't been starved
though i dare say you wouldn't have grieved if he had
and he is actually in this city
just so
does he know anything of you know what i mean
he doesn't know that he is the son of a rich man and heir to the property which you look upon as yours
that's what you mean isn't it
yes
what is he doing
is he at work
he helps me some in the saloon sells papers in the evenings and makes himself generally useful
has he any education
well i haven't sent him to boarding school or college answered tim
he don't know no greek or latin or mathematics phew that's a hard word
you didn't tell me you wanted him made a scholar of
i didn't
i wanted never to see or hear from him again
what made you bring him back to new york
couldn't keep away governor
i got homesick i did
there ain't but one bowery in the world and i hankered after that didn't i pay you money to keep away tim bolton
i don't deny it but what's three thousand dollars
why the kid's cost me more than that
i've had the care of him for fourteen years and it's only about two hundred a year
you have broken your promise to me
said curtis sternly
there's worse things than breaking your promise retorted bolton
scarcely had he spoken than a change came over his face and he stared open mouthed behind him and beyond curtis
startled himself curtis turned and saw with a feeling akin to dismay the tall figure of his uncle standing on the threshold of the left portal clad in a morning gown with his eyes fixed inquiringly upon bolton and himself
chapter iii
an unholy compact
who is that man curtis
asked john linden pointing his thin finger at tim bolton who looked strangely out of place as with clay pipe he sat in the luxurious library on a sumptuous chair
that man
stammered curtis quite at a loss what to say
yes
he is a poor man out of luck who has applied to me for assistance answered curtis recovering his wits
that's it governor said bolton thinking it necessary to confirm the statement
i've got five small children at home almost starvin' your honor
that is sad
what is your business my man
it was bolton's turn to be embarrassed
my business
he repeated
that is what i said
i'm a blacksmith but i'm willing to do any honest work
that is commendable but don't you know that it is very ill bred to smoke a pipe in a gentleman's house
excuse me governor
and bolton extinguished his pipe and put it away in a pocket of his corduroy coat
i was just telling him the same thing said curtis
don't trouble yourself any further uncle
i will inquire into the man's circumstances and help him if i can
very well curtis
i came down because i thought i heard voices
john linden slowly returned to his chamber and left the two alone
the governor's getting old said bolton
when i was butler here fifteen years ago he looked like a young man
he didn't suspect that he had ever seen me before
nor that you had carried away his son bolton
who hired me to do it
who put me up to the job as far as that goes
hush
walls have ears
let us return to business
that suits me
look here tim bolton said curtis drawing up a chair and lowering his voice to a confidential pitch you say you want money
of course i do
well i don't give money for nothing
i know that
what's wanted now
you say the boy is alive
he's very much alive
is there any necessity for his living
asked curtis in a sharp hissing tone fixing his eyes searchingly on bolton to see how his hint would be taken
you mean that you want me to murder him
said bolton quickly
why not
you don't look over scrupulous
i am a bad man i admit it said bolton with a gesture of repugnance a thief a low blackguard perhaps but thank heaven
i am no murderer
and if i was i wouldn't spill a drop of that boy's blood for the fortune that is his by right
i didn't give you credit for so much sentiment bolton said curtis with a sneer
you don't look like it but appearances are deceitful
we'll drop the subject
you can serve me in another way
can you open this secretary
yes that's in my line
there is a paper in it that i want
it is my uncle's will
i have a curiosity to read it
i understand
well i'm agreeable
if you find any money or valuables you are welcome to them
i only want the paper
when will you make the attempt
to morrow night
when will it be safe
at eleven o'clock
we all retire early in this house
can you force an entrance
yes but it will be better for you to leave the outer door unlocked
i have a better plan
here is my latchkey
good
i may not do the job myself but i will see that it is done
how shall i know the will
it is in a big envelope tied with a narrow tape
probably it is inscribed 'my will'
suppose i succeed when shall i see you
i will come around to your place on the bowery
good night
curtis waring saw bolton to the door and let him out
returning he flung himself on a sofa
i can make that man useful
he reflected
there is an element of danger in the boy's presence in new york but it will go hard if i can't get rid of him
tim bolton is unexpectedly squeamish but there are others to whom i can apply
with gold everything is possible
it's time matters came to a finish
my uncle's health is rapidly failing the doctor hints that he has heart disease and the fortune for which i have been waiting so long will soon be mine if i work my cards right
i can't afford to make any mistakes now
chapter iv
florence
florence linden sat in the library the following evening in an attitude of depression
her eyelids were swollen and it was evident she had been weeping
during the day she had had an interview with her uncle in which he harshly insisted upon her yielding to his wishes and marrying her cousin curtis
but uncle she objected i do not love him
marry him and love will come
never
she said vehemently
you speak confidently miss said mr linden with irritation
listen uncle john
it is not alone that i do not love him
i dislike him i loathe him
nonsense
that is a young girl's extravagant nonsense
no uncle
there can be no reason for such a foolish dislike
what can you have against him
it is impressed upon me uncle that curtis is a bad man
there is something false treacherous about him
pooh
child
you are more foolish than i thought
i don't say curtis is an angel
no man is at least i never met any such
but he is no worse than the generality of men
in marrying him you will carry out my cherished wish
florence i have not long to live
i shall be glad to see you well established in life before i leave you
as the wife of curtis you will have a recognized position
you will go on living in this house and the old home will be maintained
but why is it necessary for me to marry at all uncle john
you will be sure to marry some one
should i divide my fortune between you and curtis you would become the prey of some unscrupulous fortune hunter
better that than become the wife of curtis waring i see you are incorrigible said her uncle angrily
do you refuse obedience to my wishes
command me in anything else uncle john and i will obey pleaded florence
indeed
you only thwart me in my cherished wish but are willing to obey me in unimportant matters
you forget the debt you owe me
i forget nothing dear uncle
i do not forget that when i was a poor little child helpless and destitute you took me in your arms gave me a home and have cared for me from that time to this as only a parent could
you remember that then
yes uncle
i hope you will not consider me wholly ungrateful
it only makes matters worse
you own your obligations yet refuse to make the only return i desire
you refuse to comfort me in the closing days of my life by marrying your cousin
because that so nearly concerns my happiness that no one has a right to ask me to sacrifice all i hold dear
i see you are incorrigible said john linden stormily
do you know what will be the consequences
i am prepared for all
then listen
if you persist in balking me i shall leave the entire estate to curtis
do with your money as you will uncle
i have no claim to more than i have received
you are right there but that is not all
florence fixed upon him a mute look of inquiry
i will give you twenty four hours more to come to your senses
then if you persist in your ingratitude and disobedience you must find another home
oh uncle you do not mean that
exclaimed florence deeply moved
i do mean it and i shall not allow your tears to move me
not another word for i will not hear it
take twenty four hours to think over what i have said
florence bowed her head on her hands and gave herself up to sorrowful thoughts
but she was interrupted by the entrance of the servant who announced mr percy de brabazon
an effeminate looking young man foppishly dressed followed the servant into the room and made it impossible for florence to deny herself as she wished to do
i hope i see you well miss florence he simpered
thank you mr de brabazon said florence coldly
i have a slight headache
i am awfully sorry i am upon my word miss florence
my doctor tells me it is only those whose bwains are vewy active that are troubled with headaches
then i presume mr de brabazon said florence with intentional sarcasm that you never have a headache
weally miss florence that is vewy clevah
you will have your joke
it was no joke i assure you mr de brabazon
i i thought it might be
didn't i see you at the opewa last evening
possibly
i was there
i often go to the opewa
it's so so fashionable don't you know
then you don't go to hear the music
oh of course but one can't always be listening to the music don't you know
i had a fwiend with me last evening an englishman a charming fellow i assure you
he's the second cousin of a lord and yet you'll hardly credit it we're weally vewy intimate
he tells me miss florence that i'm the perfect image of his cousin lord fitz noodle
i am not at all surprised
weally you are vewy kind miss florence
i thought it a great compliment
i don't know how it is but evewybody takes me for an englishman
strange isn't it
i am very glad
may i ask why miss florence
because well perhaps i had better not explain
it seems to give you pleasure
you would probably prefer to be an englishman
i admit that i have a great admiration for the english character
it's a gweat pity we have no lords in america
now if you would only allow me to bring my english fwiend here i don't care to make any new acquaintances
even if i did i prefer my own countrymen
don't you like america mr de brabazon
oh of courth if we only had some lords here
we have plenty of flunkeys
that's awfully clevah 'pon my word
is it
i am afraid you are too complimentary
you are very good natured
i always feel good natured in your company miss florence
i wish i could always be with you
really
wouldn't that be a trifle monotonous
asked florence sarcastically
not if we were married said percy boldly breaking the ice
what do you mean mr de brabazon
i hope you will excuse me miss florence miss linden i mean but i'm awfully in love with you and have been ever so long but i never dared to tell you so
i felt so nervous don't you know
will you marry me
i'll be awfully obliged if you will
mr de brabazon rather awkwardly slipped from his chair and sank on one knee before florence
please arise mr de brabazon said florence hurriedly
it is quite out of the question what you ask i assure you
ah
i see how it is said percy clasping his hands sadly
you love another
not that i am aware of
then i may still hope
i cannot encourage you mr de brabazon
my heart is free but it can never be yours
then said percy gloomily there is only one thing for me to do
what is that
i shall go to the bwooklyn bwidge climb to the parapet jump into the water and end my misewable life
you had better think twice before adopting such a desperate resolution mr de brabazon
you will meet others who will be kinder to you than i have been i can never love another
my heart is broken
farewell cruel girl
when you read the papers tomorrow morning think of the unhappy percy de brabazon
mr de brabazon folded his arms gloomily and stalked out of the room
if my position were not so sad i should be tempted to smile said florence
mr de brabazon will not do this thing
his emotions are as strong as those of a butterfly
after a brief pause florence seated herself at the table and drew toward her writing materials
it is i whose heart should be broken
she murmured i who am driven from the only home i have ever known
what can have turned against me my uncle usually so kind and considerate
it must be that curtis has exerted a baneful influence upon him
i cannot leave him without one word of farewell
she took up a sheet of paper and wrote rapidly she was about to sign herself florence linden but reflected that she was no longer entitled to use a name which would seem to carry with it a claim upon her uncle
the tears fell upon the paper as she was writing but she heeded them not
it was the saddest hour of her life
hitherto she had been shielded from all sorrow and secure in the affection of her uncle had never dreamed that there would come a time when she would feel obliged to leave all behind her and go out into the world friendless and penniless but poorest of all in the loss of that love which she had hitherto enjoyed
after completing the note florence let her head fall upon the table and sobbed herself to sleep
an hour and a half passed the servant looked in but noticing that her mistress was sleeping contented herself with lowering the gas but refrained from waking her
and so she slept on till the french clock upon the mantle struck eleven
five minutes later and the door of the room slowly opened and a boy entered on tiptoe
he was roughly dressed
his figure was manly and vigorous and despite his stealthy step and suspicious movements his face was prepossessing
he started when he saw florence
what a sleeping gal
he said to himself
tim told me i'd find the coast clear but i guess she's sound asleep and won't hear nothing
i don't half like this job but i've got to do as tim told me
he says he's my father so i s'pose it's all right
all the same i shall be nabbed some day and then the family'll be disgraced
it's a queer life i've led ever since i can remember
sometimes i feel like leaving tim and settin' up for myself
i wonder how 'twould seem to be respectable
the boy approached the secretary and with some tools he had brought essayed to open it
after a brief delay he succeeded and lifted the cover
he was about to explore it according to tim's directions when he heard a cry of fear and turning swiftly saw florence her eyes dilated with terror gazing at him
who are you
she asked in alarm and what are you doing there
chapter v dodger
the boy sprang to the side of florence and siezed her wrists in his strong young grasp
don't you alarm the house he said or i'll what will you do
gasped florence in alarm
the boy was evidently softened by her beauty and answered in a tone of hesitation i don't know
i won't harm you if you keep quiet
what are you here for
asked florence fixing her eyes on the boy's face are you a thief
i don't know yes i suppose i am
how sad when you are so young
what
miss do you pity me
yes my poor boy you must be very poor or you wouldn't bring yourself to steal
no
i ain't poor leastways i have enough to eat and i have a place to sleep
then why don't you earn your living by honest means
i can't i must obey orders
whose orders
why the guv'nor's to be sure
did he tell you to open that secretary
yes
who is the guv'nor as you call him
i can't tell it wouldn't be square
he must be a very wicked man
well he ain't exactly what you call an angel but i've seen wuss men than the guv'nor
do you mind telling me your own name
no for i know you won't peach on me
tom dodger
dodger
yes
that isn't a surname
it's all i've got
that's what i'm always called
it is very singular said florence fixing a glance of mingled curiosity and perplexity upon the young visitor
while the two were earnestly conversing in that subdued light afforded by the lowered gaslight tim bolton crept in through the door unobserved by either tiptoed across the room to the secretary snatched the will and a roll of bills and escaped without attracting attention
oh i wish i could persuade you to give up this bad life resumed florence earnestly and become honest
do you really care what becomes of me miss
asked dodger slowly
i do indeed
that's very kind of you miss but i don't understand it
you are a rich young lady and i'm only a poor boy livin' in a bowery dive
what's that
never mind miss such as you wouldn't understand
why all my life i've lived with thieves and drunkards and bunco men and but i'm sure you don't like it
you are fit for something better
do you really think so
asked dodger doubtfullly
yes you have a good face
you were meant to be good and honest i am sure
would you trust me
asked the boy earnestly fixing his large dark eyes eloquently on the face of florence
yes i would if you would only leave your evil companions and become true to your better nature
no one ever spoke to me like that before miss said dodger his expressive features showing that he was strongly moved
you think i could be good if i tried hard and grow up respectable
i am sure you could said florence confidently
there was something in this boy young outlaw though he was that moved her powerfully and even fascinated her though she hardly realized it
it was something more than a feeling of compassion for a wayward and misguided youth
i could if i was rich like you and lived in a nice house and 'sociated with swells
if you had a father like mine is he a bad man
well he don't belong to the church
he keeps a gin mill and has ever since i was a kid
have you always lived with him
yes but not in new york
where then
in melbourne
that's in australia
yes miss
how long since you came to new york
i guess it's about three years
and you have always had this man as a guardian
poor boy
you've got a different father from me miss
tears forced themselves to the eyes of florence as this remark brought forcibly to her mind the position in which she was placed
alas
she answered impulsively i am alone in the world
what
ain't the old gentleman that lives here your father
he is my uncle but he is very very angry with me and has this very day ordered me to leave the house
why what a cantankerous old ruffian he is to be sure
exclaimed the boy indignantly
hush
you must not talk against my uncle
he has always been kind to me till now
why what's up
what's the old gentleman mad about
he wants me to marry my cousin curtis a man i do not even like
that's a shame
is it the dude i saw come out of the house a little while ago
oh no that's a different gentleman
it's mr de brabazon
you don't want to marry him do you
no no
i'm glad of that
he don't look as if he knew enough to come in when it rained
the poor young man is not very brilliant but i think i would rather marry him than curtis waring
i've seen him too
he's got dark hair and a dark complexion and a wicked look in his eye
you too have noticed that
i've seen such as him before
he's a bad man
do you know anything about him
asked florence eagerly
only his looks
i am not deceived murmured florence it's not wholly prejudice
the boy distrusts him too
so you see dodger she added aloud i am not a rich young lady as you suppose
i must leave this house and work for my living
i have no home any more
if you have no home said dodger impulsively come home with me
to the home you have described my poor boy
how could i do that
no i will hire a room for you in a quiet street and you shall be my sister
i will work for you and give you my money
you are kind and i am glad to think i have found a friend when i need one most
but i could not accept stolen money
it would be as bad as if i too were a thief
i am not a thief
that is i won't be any more
and you will give up your plan of robbing my uncle
yes i will though i don't know what my guv'nor will say
he'll half murder me i expect
he'll be sure to cut up rough
do right dodger whatever happens
promise me that you will never steal again
there's my hand miss i promise
nobody ever talked to me like you
i never thought much about bein' respectable and growin' up to be somebody but if you take an interest in me i'll try hard to do right
at this moment mr linden clad in a long morning gown and holding a candle in his hand entered the room and started in astonishment when he saw florence clasping the hand of one whose appearance led him to stamp as a young rough
shameless girl
he exclaimed in stern reproof
so this is the company you keep when you think i am out of the way
chapter vi
a tempest
the charge was so strange and unexpected that florence was overwhelmed
she could only murmur oh uncle
her young companion was indignant
already he felt that florence had consented to accept him as a friend and he was resolved to stand by her
i say old man he bristled up don't you go to insult her
she's an angel
no doubt you think so rejoined mr linden in a tone of sarcasm
upon my word miss i congratulate you on your elevated taste
so this is your reason for not being willing to marry your cousin curtis
indeed uncle you are mistaken
i never met this boy till to night
don't try to deceive me
young man did you open my secretary
yes sir
and robbed it into the bargain continued linden going to the secretary and examining it
he did not however miss the will but only the roll of bills
give me back the money you have taken from me you young rascal
i took nothing sir
it's a lie
the money is gone and no one else could have taken it
i don't allow no one to call me a liar
just take that back old man or i indeed uncle he took nothing for he had only just opened the secretary when i woke up and spoke to him
you stand by him of course shameless girl
i blush to think that you are my niece
i am glad to think that my eyes are opened before it is too late
the old merchant rang the bell violently and aroused the house
dodger made no attempt to escape but stood beside florence in the attitude of a protector
but a short time elapsed before curtis waring and the servants entered the room and gazed with wonder at the tableau presented by the excited old man and the two young people
my friends said john linden in a tone of excitement i call you to witness that this girl whom i blush to acknowledge as my niece has proved herself unworthy of my kindness
in your presence i cut her off and bid her never again darken my door
but what has she done uncle
asked curtis
he was prepared for the presence of dodger whom he rightly concluded to be the agent of tim bolton but he could not understand why florence should be in the library at this late hour
nor was he able to understand the evidently friendly relations between her and the young visitor
what has she done
repeated john linden
she has introduced that young ruffian into the house to rob me
look at that secretary
he has forced it open and stolen a large sum of money
it is not true sir said dodger calmly about taking the money i mean
i haven't taken a cent
then why did you open the secretary
i did mean to take money but she stopped me
oh she stopped you
repeated linden with withering sarcasm
then perhaps you will tell me where the money is gone
he hasn't discovered about the will thought curtis congratulating himself if the boy has it i must manage to give him a chance to escape
you can search me if you want to continued dodger proudly
you won't find no money on me
do you think i am a fool you young burglar
exclaimed john linden angrily
uncle let me speak to the boy said curtis soothingly
i think he will tell me
as you like curtis but i am convinced that he is a thief
curtis waring beckoned dodger into an adjoining room
now my boy he said smoothly give me what you took from the secretary and i will see that you are not arrested
but sir i didn't take nothing it's just as i told the old duffer
the girl waked up just as i'd got the secretary open and i didn't have a chance
but the money is gone said curtis in an incredulous tone
i don't know nothing about that
come you'd better examine your pockets
in the hurry of the moment you may have taken it without knowing it
no i couldn't
didn't you take a paper of any kind
asked curtis eagerly
sometimes papers are of more value than money
no i didn't take no paper though tim told me to
curtis quietly ignored the allusion to tim for it did not suit his purpose to get tim into trouble
his unscrupulous agent knew too much that would compromise his principal
are you willing that i should examine you
yes i am
go ahead
curtis thrust his hand into the pockets of the boy who boy as he was was as tall as himself but was not repaid by the discovery of anything
he was very much perplexed
didn't you throw the articles on the floor
he demanded suspiciously
no i didn't
you didn't give them to the young lady
no if i had she'd have said so
humph
this is strange
what is your name
dodger
that's a queer name have you no other
not as i know of
with whom do you live
with my father
leastways he says he's my father
there was a growing suspicion in the mind of curtis waring
he scanned the boy's features with attention
could this ill dressed boy a street boy in appearance be his long lost and deeply wronged cousin
who is it that says he is your father
he demanded abruptly
do you want to get him into trouble
no i don't want to get him into trouble or you either
better tell me all and i will be your friend
you're a better sort than i thought at first said dodger
the man i live with is called tim bolton
i though so quickly ejaculated curtis
he had scarcely got out the words before he was sensible that he had made a mistake
what
do you know tim
inquired dodger in surprise
i mean replied curtis lamely that i have heard of this man bolton
he keeps a saloon on the bowery doesn't he
yes
i thought you would be living with some such man
did he come to the house with you tonight
yes
where is he
he stayed outside
perhaps he is there now
don't you go to having him arrested said dodger suspiciously
i will keep my promise
are you sure you didn't pass out the paper and the money to him
think now
no i didn't
i didn't have a chance
when i came into the room yonder i saw the gal asleep and i thought she wouldn't hear me but when i got the desk open she spoke to me and asked me what i was doin'
and you took nothing
no
it seems very strange
i cannot understand it
yet my uncle says the money is gone
did anyone else enter the room while you were talking with miss linden
i didn't see any one
what were you talking about
she said the old man wanted her to marry you and she didn't want to
she told you that
exclaimed curtis in displeasure
yes she did
she said she'd rather marry the dude that was here early this evenin'
mr de brabazon
yes that's the name
upon my word she was very confidential
you are a queer person for her to select as a confidant
maybe so sir but she knows i'm her friend
you like the young lady then
perhaps you would like to marry her yourself
as if she'd take any notice of a poor boy like me
i told her if her uncle sent her away i'd take care of her and be a brother to her
how would mr tim bolton that's his name isn't it like that
i wouldn't take her to where he lives
i think myself it would hardly be a suitable home for a young lady brought up on madison avenue
there is certainly no accounting for tastes
miss florence that's her name is it
yes didn't she tell you
no but it's a nice name
she declines my hand and accepts your protection
it will certainly be a proud distinction to become mrs
dodger
don't laugh at her
said dodger suspiciously
i don't propose to
but i think we may as well return to the library
well said mr linden as his nephew returned with dodger
i have examined the boy and found nothing on his person said curtis i confess i am puzzled
he appears to have a high admiration for florence as i supposed
she has even confided to him her dislike for me and he has offered her his protection
is this so miss
demanded mr linden sternly
yes uncle faltered florence
then you can join the young person you have selected whenever you please
for your sake i will not have him arrested for attempted burglary
he is welcome to what he has taken since he is likely to marry into the family
you may stay here to night and he can call for you in the morning
john linden closed the secretary and left the room leaving florence sobbing
the servants too retired and curtis was left alone with her
florence he said accept my hand and i will reconcile my uncle to you
say but the word and i can never speak it curtis
i will take my uncle at his word
dodger call for me to morrow at eight and i will accept your friendly services in finding me a new home
i'll be on hand miss
good night
be it so obstinate girl
said curtis angrily
the time will come when you will bitterly repent your mad decision
chapter vii
florence leaves home
florence passed a sleepless night
it had come upon her so suddenly this expulsion from the home of her childhood that she could not fully realize it
she could not feel that she was taking her last look at the familiar room and well remembered dining room where she had sat down for the last time for breakfast
she was alone at the breakfast table for the usual hour was half past eight and she had appointed dodger to call for her at eight
is it true miss florence that you're going away
asked jane the warm hearted table girl as she waited upon florence
yes jane answered florence sadly
it's a shame so it is
i didn't think your uncle would be so hard hearted
he is disappointed because i won't marry my cousin curtis
i don't blame you for it miss
i never liked mr waring
he isn't half good enough for you
i say nothing about that jane but i will not marry a man i do not love
nor would i miss
where are you going if i may make so bold
i don't know jane said florence despondently
but you can't walk about the streets
a trusty friend is going to call for me at eight o'clock when he comes admit him
it is a a young gentleman
you wouldn't call him such
he is a boy a poor boy but i think he is a true friend
he says he will find me a comfortable room somewhere where i can settle down and look for work
are you going to work for a living miss florence
asked jane horrified
i must jane
it's a great shame you a lady born
no jane i do not look upon it in that light
i shall be happier for having my mind and my hands occupied
what work will you do
i don't know yet
dodger will advise me
who miss
dodger
who is he
it's the boy i spoke of
shure he's got a quare name
yes but names don't count for much
it's the heart i think of and this boy has a kind heart
have you known him long
i saw him yesterday for the first time
is it the young fellow who was here last night
yes
he isn't fit company for the likes of you miss florence
you forget jane that i am no longer a rich young lady
i am poorer than even you
this dodger is kind and i feel that i can trust him
if you are poor miss florence said jane hesitatingly would you mind borrowing some money of me
i've got ten dollars upstairs in my trunk and i don't need it at all
it's proud i'll be to lend it to you
thank you jane said florence gratefully
i thought i had but one friend
i find i have two then you'll take the money
i'll go right up and get it
no jane not at present
i have twenty dollars in my purse and it will last me till i can earn more
but miss twenty dollars will soon go said jane disappointed
if i find that i need the sum you so kindly offer me i will let you know i promise that
thank you miss
at this point a bell rang from above
it's from mr curtis' room said jane
go and see what he wants
jane returned in a brief time with a note in her hand
mr curtis asked me if you were still here she explained and when i told him you were he asked me to give you this
florence took the note and opening it read these lines florence ran her eyes rapidly over this note but her heart did not respond and her resolution was not shaken
tell mr waring there is no answer jane if he inquires she said
was he tryin' to wheedle you into marryin' him
asked jane
he wished me to change my decision
i'm glad you've given him the bounce said jane whose expressions were not always refined
i wouldn't marry him myself
florence smiled
jane was red haired and her nose was what is euphemistically called retrousse
even in her own circles she was not regarded as beautiful and was hardly likely to lead a rich man to overlook her humble station and sue for her hand
then jane you at least will not blame me for refusing my cousin's hand
that i won't miss
do you know miss florence and here jane lowered her voice i've a suspicion that mr curtis is married already
what do you mean jane
asked florence startled
there was a poor young woman called here last month and inquired for mr curtis
she was very sorrowful like and poorly dressed
he came up when she was at the door and he spoke harshlike and told her to walk away with him
what they said i couldn't hear but i've a suspicion that she was married to him secretlike for i saw a wedding ring upon her finger
but jane it would be base and infamous for him to ask for my hand when he was already married
i can't help it miss
that's just what he wouldn't mind doin'
oh he's a sly deceiver mr curtis
i'd like to see him foolin' around me
jane nodded her head with emphasis as if to intimate the kind of reception curtis waring would get if he attempted to trifle with her virgin affections
i hope what you suspect is not true said florence gravely
i do not like or respect curtis but i don't like to think he would be so base as that
if you ever see this young woman again try to find out where she lives
i would like to make her acquaintance and be a friend to her if she needs one
shure miss florence you will be needin' a friend yourself
it is true jane
i forgot that i am no longer a young lady of fortune but a penniless girl obliged to work for a living
what would your uncle say if he knew that mr curtis had a wife
we don't know that he has one and till we do it would not be honorable to intimate such a thing to uncle john
shure he wouldn't be particular
it's all his fault that you're obliged to leave home and go into the streets
why couldn't he take no for an answer and marry somebody else if he can find anybody to have him
i wish indeed that he had fixed his affections elsewhere responded florence with a sigh
shure he's twice as old as you miss florence anyway
i shouldn't mind that so much if that was the only objection
it'll be a great deal better marryin' a young man
i don't care to marry any one jane
i don't think i shall ever marry
it's all very well to say that miss florence
lots of girls say so but they change their minds
i don't mean to live out always myself
is there any young man you are interested in jane
maybe there is and maybe there isn't miss florence
if i ever do get married i'll invite you to the wedding
and i'll promise to come if i can
but i hear the bell
i think my friend dodger has come
shall i ask him in miss
no
tell him i will be ready to accompany him at once
she went out into the hall and when the door was opened the visitor proved to be dodger
he had improved his appearance so far as his limited means would allow
his hands and face were thoroughly clean he had bought a new collar and necktie his shoes were polished and despite his shabby suit he looked quite respectable
getting a full view of him florence saw that his face was frank and handsome his eyes bright and his teeth like pearls
shure he's a great deal better lookin' than mr curtis whispered jane
here mr dodger take miss florence's valise and mind you take good care of her
i will answered dodger heartily
come miss florence if you don't mind walking over to fourth avenue we'll take the horse cars
so under strange guidance florence linden left her luxurious home knowing not what awaited her
what haven of refuge she might find she knew not
she like dodger was adrift in new york
chapter viii
a friendly compact
florence as she stepped on the sidewalk turned and fixed a last sad look on the house that had been her home for so many years
she had never anticipated such a sundering of home ties and even now she found it difficult to realize that the moment had come when her life was to be rent in twain and the sunlight of prosperity was to be darkened and obscured by a gloomy and uncertain future
she had hastily packed a few indispensable articles in a valise which she carried in her hand
let me take your bag miss florence said dodger reaching out his hand
i don't want to trouble you dodger
it ain't no trouble miss florence
i'm stronger than you and it looks better for me to carry it
you are very kind dodger
what would i do without you
there's plenty that would be glad of the chance of helping you said dodger with a glance of admiration at the fair face of his companion
i don't know where to find them said florence sadly
even my uncle has turned against me
he's an old chump
ejaculated dodger in a tone of disgust
hush
i cannot hear a word against him
he has always been kind and considerate till now
it is the evil influence of my cousin curtis that has turned him against me
when he comes to himself i am sure he will regret his cruelty
he would take you back if you would marry your cousin
yes but that i will never do
exclaimed florence with energy
bully for you
said dodger
excuse me he said apologetically
i ain't used to talkin' to young ladies and perhaps that ain't proper for me to say
i don't mind dodger your heart is in the right place
thank you miss florence
i'm glad you've got confidence in me
i'll try to deserve it
where are we going
asked the young lady whose only thought up to this moment had been to get away from the presence of curtis and his persecutions
they had now reached fourth avenue and a surface car was close at hand
we're going to get aboard that car said dodger signaling with his free hand
i'll tell you more when we're inside
florence entered the car and dodger following took a seat at her side
they presented a noticeable contrast for florence was dressed as beseemed her station while dodger in spite of his manly attractive face was roughly attired and looked like a working boy
when the conductor came along he drew out a dime and tendered it in payment of the double fare
the money was in the conductor's hand before florence was fully aware
you must not pay for me dodger she said
why not
asked the boy
ain't we friends
yes but you have no money to spare
here let me return the money
and she offered him a dime from her own purse
you can pay next time miss florence
it's all right
now i'll tell you where we are goin'
a friend of mine mrs o'keefe has a lodgin' house just off the bowery
i saw her last night and she says she's got a good room that she can give you for two dollars a week i don't know how much you'd be willing to pay but i can pay that for a time at least
i have a little money and i must find some work to do soon
is this mrs o'keefe a nice lady
she ain't a lady at all answered dodger bluntly
she keeps an apple stand near the corner of bowery and grand street but she's a good respectable woman and she's good hearted
she'll be kind to you and try to make things pleasant but if you ain't satisfied it will do for the present
kindness is what i need driven as i am from the home of my childhood
but you dodger where do you live
i'm goin' to take a small room in the same house miss florence
i shall be glad to have you near me
i am proud to hear you say that
i'm a poor boy and you're a rich lady but not rich dodger
i am as poor as yourself
you're a reg'lar lady anyway
you ain't one of my kind but i'm going to improve and raise myself
i was readin' the other day of a rich man that was once a poor boy and sold papers like me
but there's one thing in the way i ain't got no eddication
you can read and write can't you dodger
yes i can read pretty well but i can't write much
i will teach you in the evenings when we are both at leisure
will you
asked the boy with a glad smile
you're very kind i'd like a teacher like you
then it's a bargain dodger and florence's face for the first time lost its sad look as she saw an opportunity of helping one who had befriended her
but you must promise to study faithfully
that i will
if i don't i'll give you leave to lick me
i shan't forget that said florence amused
i will buy a ruler of good hard wood and then you must look out
but tell me where have you lived hitherto
i don't like to tell you miss florence
i've lived ever since i was a kid with a man named tim bolton
he keeps a saloon on the bowery near houston street
it's a tough place i tell you
i've got a bed in one corner it's tucked away in a closet in the day
i suppose it is a drinking saloon
yes that's what it is
and kept open very late
pretty much all night
is this tim bolton any relation of yours
he says he's my father but i don't believe it
have you always lived with him
ever since i was a small kid
have you always lived in new york
no i was out in australia
tim was out in the country part of the time and part of the time he kept a saloon in melbourne
there was thieves and burglars used to come into his place
i knew what they were though they didn't think i did
how terrible for a boy to be subjected to such influences
but i've made up my mind i won't live with tim no longer
i can earn my own livin' sellin' papers or smashin' baggage and keep away from tim
i'd have done it before if i'd had a friend like you to care for me
we will stand by each other dodger
heaven knows i need a friend and if i can be a friend to you and help you i will
we'll get out here miss florence
i told mrs o'keefe i'd call at her stand and she'll go over and show you your room
they left the car at the corner of grand street and dodger led the way to an apple stand presided over by a lady of ample proportions whose broad celtic face seemed to indicate alike shrewd good sense and a kindly spirit
mrs o'keefe said dodger this is the young lady i spoke to you about miss florence linden
it's welcome you are my dear and i'm very glad to make your acquaintance
you look like a rale leddy and i don't know how you'll like the room i've got for you
i cannot afford to be particular mrs o'keefe
i have had a a reverse of circumstances and i must be content with an humble home
then i'll go over and show it to you
here kitty come and mind the stand she called to a girl about thirteen across the street and don't let anybody steal the apples
look out for jimmy mahone he stole a couple of apples right under my nose this mornin' the young spalpeen
as they were crossing the street a boy of fourteen ran up to dodger
dodger said he you'd better go right over to tim bolton's
he's in an awful stew says he'll skin you alive if you don't come to the s'loon right away
chapter ix
the new home
you can tell tim bolton said dodger that i don't intend to come back at all
you don't mean it dodger
said ben holt incredulously
yes i do
i'm going to set up for myself
oh dodger said florence i'm afraid you will get into trouble for my sake
don't worry about that miss florence
i'm old enough to take care of myself and i've got tired of livin' with tim
but he may beat you
he'll have to get hold of me first
they had reached a four story tenement of shabby brick which was evidently well filled up by a miscellaneous crowd of tenants shop girls mechanics laborers and widows living by their daily toil
florence had never visited this part of the city and her heart sank within her as she followed mrs o'keefe through a dirty hallway up a rickety staircase to the second floor
one more flight of stairs my dear said mrs o'keefe encouragingly
i've got four rooms upstairs one of them is for you and one for dodger
florence did not reply
she began to understand at what cost she had secured her freedom from a distasteful marriage
in her madison avenue home all the rooms were light clean and luxuriously furnished
here but words were inadequate to describe the contrast
mrs o'keefe threw open the door of a back room about twelve feet square furnished in the plainest manner uncarpeted except for a strip that was laid like a rug beside the bedstead
there was a washstand with a mirror twelve by fifteen inches placed above it a pine bureau a couple of wooden chairs and a cane seated rocking chair
there my dear what do you say to that
asked mrs o'keefe complacently
all nice and comfortable as you would wish to see
it is very nice said florence faintly sacrificing truth to politeness
and who do you think used to live here
asked the apple woman
i'm sure i don't know
the bearded woman in the dime museum answered mrs o'keefe nodding her head
she lived with me three months and she furnished the room herself
when she went away she was hard up and i bought the furniture of her cheap
you remember madam berger don't you dodger
oh yes i seen her often
she got twenty five dollars a week and she'd ought to have saved money but she had a good for nothin' husband that drank up all her hard earnin's
i hope she didn't drink herself said florence who shuddered at the idea of succeeding a drunken tenant
not a drop
she was a good sober lady if she did work in a dime museum
she only left here two weeks ago
it isn't every one i'd be willin' to take in her place but i see you're a real leddy let alone that dodger recommends you
i hope you'll like the room and i'll do all i can to make things pleasant
you can go into my room any hour my dear and do your little cookin' on my stove
i s'pose you'll do your own cookin'
well not just at present faltered florence
i am afraid i don't know much about cooking
you'll find it a deal cheaper and it's more quiet and gentale than goin' to the eatin' houses
i'll help you all i can and glad to
thank you mrs o'keefe you are very kind said florence gratefully
perhaps just at first you wouldn't object to taking me as a boarder and letting me take my meals with you
i don't think i would like to go to the eating houses alone
to be sure my dear if you wish it and i'll be glad of your company
i'll make the terms satisfactory
i have no doubt of that said florence feeling very much relieved
if i might be so bold what kind of work are you going to do
i hardly know
it has come upon me so suddenly
i shall have to do something for i haven't got much money
what i should like best would be to write is it for the papers you mean
oh no i mean for some author or lawyer
i don't know much about that said mrs o'keefe
in fact i don't mind tellin' you my dear that i can't write myself but i earn a good livin' all the same by my apple stand
i tell you my dear she continued in a confidential tone there is a good dale of profit in sellin' apples
it's better than sewin' or writin'
of course a young leddy like you wouldn't like to go into the business
florence shook her head with a smile
no mrs o'keefe she said
i am afraid i haven't a business turn and i should hardly like so public an employment
lor' miss it's nothin' if you get used to it
there's nothin' dull about my business unless it rains and you get used to havin' people look at you
it isn't all that are worth looking at like you mrs o'keefe said dodger slyly
oh go away wid your fun dodger said the apple woman good naturedly
i ain't much to look at i know
i think there's a good deal of you to look at mrs o'keefe
you must weigh near three hundred
i've a good mind to box your ears dodger
i only weigh a hundred and ninety five
but i can't be bothered wid your jokes
can you sew miss florence
yes but i would rather earn my living some other way if possible
small blame to you for that
i had a girl in dodger's room last year who used to sew for a livin'
early and late she worked poor thing and she couldn't make but two dollars a week
how could she live
asked florence startled for she knew very little of the starvation wages paid to toiling women
she didn't live
she just faded away and it's my belief the poor thing didn't get enough to eat
every day or two i'd make an excuse to take her in something from my own table a plate of meat or a bit of toast and a cup of tay makin' belave she didn't get a chance to cook for herself but she got thinner and thinner and her poor cheeks got hollow and she died in the hospital at last
the warm hearted apple woman wiped away a tear with the corner of her apron as she thought of the poor girl whose sad fate she described
you won't die of consumption mrs o'keefe said dodger
it'll take a good while for you to fade away
hear him now said the apple woman laughing
he will have his joke miss florence but he's a good bye for all that and i'm glad he's goin' to lave tim bolton that ould thafe of the worruld
now mrs o'keefe you know you'd marry tim if he'd only ask you
marry him is it
i'd lay my broom over his head if he had the impudence to ask me
when maggie o'keefe marries ag'in she won't marry a man wid a red nose
break it gently to him mrs o'keefe
tim is just the man to break his heart for love of you
mrs o'keefe aimed a blow at dodger but he proved true to his name and skillfully evaded it
i must be goin' he said
i've got to work or i can't pay room rent when the week comes round
what are you going to do dodger
asked florence
it isn't time for the evenin' papers yet so i shall go 'round to the piers and see if i can't get a job at smashin' baggage
but i shouldn't think any one would want to do that said florence puzzled
it's what we boys call it
it's just carryin' valises and bundles
sometimes i show strangers the way to broadway
last week an old man paid me a dollar to show him the way to the cooper institute
he was a gentleman he was
i'd like to meet him ag'in
good by miss florence i'll be back some time this afternoon
and i must be goin' too said mrs o'keefe
i can't depend on that kitty she's a wild slip of a girl and just as like as not i'll find a dozen apples stole when i get back
i hope you won't feel lonely my dear
i think i will lie down a while said florence
i have a headache
she threw herself on the bed and a feeling of loneliness and desolation came over her
her new friends were kind but they could not make up to her for her uncle's love so strangely lost and the home she had left behind
chapter x
the arch conspirator
in the house on madison avenue curtis waring was left in possession of the field
through his machinations florence had been driven from home and disinherited
he was left sole heir to his uncle's large property with the prospect of soon succeeding for though only fifty four john linden looked at least ten years older and was as feeble as many men past seventy
yet as curtis seated himself at the breakfast table an hour after florence had left the house he looked far from happy or triumphant
one thing he had not succeeded in the conquest of his cousin's heart
though he loved himself best he was really in love with florence so far as he was capable of being in love with any one
she was only half his age scarcely that but he persuaded himself that the match was in every way suitable
he liked to fancy her at the head of his table after the death of his uncle which he anticipated in a few months at latest
the more she appeared to dislike him the more he determined to marry her even against her will
she was the only one likely to inherit john linden's wealth and by marrying her he would make sure of it
yet she had been willing to leave the home of her youth to renounce luxury for a life of poverty rather than to marry him
when he thought of this his face became set and its expression stern and determined
florence shall yet be mine he declared resolutely
i will yet be master of her fate and bend her to my will
foolish girl how dare she match her puny strength against the resolute will of curtis waring
was there any one else whom she loved
he asked himself anxiously
no he could think of none
on account of his uncle's chronic invalidism they had neither gone into society nor entertained visitors and in the midst of a great city florence and her uncle had practically led the lives of recluses
there had been no opportunity to meet young men who might have proved claimants for her hand
when did miss florence leave the house jane
he inquired as he seated himself at the table
most an hour since the girl answered coldly for she disliked curtis as much as she loved and admired florence
it is sad very sad that she should be so headstrong said curtis with hypocritical sorrow
it is sad for her to go away from her own uncle's house returned jane
and very very foolish
i don't know about that sir
she had her reasons said jane significantly
curtis coughed
he had no doubt that florence had talked over the matter with her hand maiden
did she say where she was going jane
he asked
i don't think the poor child knew herself sir
did she go alone
no sir the boy that was here last night called for her
that ragamuffin
said curtis scornfully
she certainly shows extraordinary taste for a young lady of family
the boy seems a very kind and respectable boy said jane who had been quite won by dodger's kindness to her young mistress
he may be respectable though i am not so sure of that but his position in life is very humble
he is probably a bootblack a singular person to select for the friend of a girl like florence
there's them that stands higher that isn't half so good retorted jane with more zeal than good grammar
did miss florence take a cab
no she just walked
but she took some clothing with her
she took a handbag that is all
she will send for her trunk
if you find out where she is living just let me know jane
i will if she is willing to have me answered jane independently
look here jane said curtis angrily don't forget that you are not her servant but my uncle's
it is to him you look for wages not to miss florence
i don't need to be told that sir
i know that well enough
then you know that it is to him that your faithful services are due not to florence
i'm faithful to both mr
waring
you are aware that my uncle is justly displeased with my cousin
i know he's displeased but i am sure he has no good reason to be
curtis waring bit his lips
the girl servant as she was seemed to be openly defying him
his imperious temper could ill brook this
take care
he said with a frown
you seem to be lacking in respect to me
you don't appear to understand my position in this house
oh yes i do
i know you have schemed to get my poor young mistress out of the house and have succeeded
i have a great mind to discharge you girl said curtis with lowering brow
i am not your servant sir
you have nothing to do with me
you will see whether i have or not
i will let you remain for a time as it is your attachment to miss florence that has made you forget yourself
you will find that it is for your interest to treat me respectfully
a feeble step was heard at the door and john linden entered the breakfast room
his face was sad and he heaved a sigh as he glanced mechanically at the head of the table where florence usually sat
curtis waring sprang to his feet and placing himself at his uncle's side led him to his seat
how do you feel this morning uncle
he asked with feigned solicitude
ill curtis
i didn't sleep well last night
i don't wonder sir
you had much to try you
is is florence here
no sir answered jane promptly
she left the house an hour ago
a look of pain appeared on john linden's pale face
did did she leave a message for me
he asked slowly
she asked me to bid you good by for her answered jane quickly
uncle don't let yourself be disturbed now with painful thoughts
eat your breakfast first and then we will speak of florence
john linden ate a very light breakfast
he seemed to have lost his appetite and merely toyed with his food
when he arose from the table curtis supported him to the library
it is very painful to me this conduct of florence's curtis he said as he sank into his armchair
i understand it fully uncle said curtis
when i think of it it makes me very angry with the misguided girl
perhaps i have been too harsh too stern
you uncle too harsh
why you are the soul of gentleness
florence has shown herself very ungrateful
yet curtis i love that girl
her mother seemed to live again in her
have i not acted cruelly in requiring her to obey me or leave the house
you have acted only for good
you are seeking her happiness
you really think this curtis
i am sure of it
but how will it all end
asked linden bending an anxious look upon his wily nephew
by florence yielding
you are sure of that
yes
listen uncle florence is only capricious like most girls of her age
she foolishly desires to have her own way
it is nothing more serious i can assure you
but she has left the house
that seems to show that she is in earnest
she thinks uncle that by doing so she can bend you to her wishes
she hasn't the slightest idea of any permanent separation
she is merely experimenting upon your weakness
she expects you will recall her in a week at the latest
that is all of it
like most weak men it made mr linden angry to have his strength doubted
you think that
he said
i have no doubt of it
she shall find that i am resolute he said irritably
i will not recall her
bravo uncle
only stick to that and she will yield unconditionally within a fortnight
a little patience and you will carry your point
then all will be smooth sailing
i hope so curtis
your words have cheered me
i will be patient
but i hope i shan't have to wait long
where is the morning paper
i shall have to humor and deceive him thought curtis
i shall have a difficult part to play but i am sure to succeed at last
chapter xi
florence secures employment
for a few days after being installed in her new home florence was like one dazed
she could not settle her mind to any plan of self support
she was too unhappy in her enforced exile from her home and it saddened her to think that the uncle who had always been so kind was permanently estranged from her
though mrs o'keefe was kind and dodger was her faithful friend she could not accustom herself to her poor surroundings
she had not supposed luxury so essential to her happiness
it was worse for her because she had nothing to do but give way to her morbid fancies
this mrs o'keefe was clear sighted enough to see
i am sorry to see you so downcast like my dear young lady she said
how can i help it mrs
o'keefe
returned florence
try not to think of your wicked cousin my dear
it isn't of him that i think it is of my uncle
how could he be so cruel and turn against me after years of kindness
it's that wicked curtis that is settin' him against you take my word for it miss florence
shure he must be wake minded to let such a spalpeen set him against a swate young leddy like you
he is weak in body not in mind mrs o'keefe
you are right in thinking that it is curtis that is the cause of my misfortune
your uncle will come to his right mind some day never fear
and now my dear shall i give you a bit of advice
go on my kind friend
i will promise to consider whatever you say
then you'd better get some kind of work to take up your mind a bit of sewin' or writin' or anything that comes to hand
i suppose you wouldn't want to mind my apple stand a couple of hours every day
no answered florence
i don't feel equal to that
it would do you no end of good to be out in the open air
it would bring back the roses to your pale cheeks
if you coop yourself up in this dark room you'll fade away and get thin
you are right
i will make an effort and go out
besides i must see about work
here dodger entered the room in his usual breezy way
in his hand he brandished a morning paper
how are you feelin' florence
he asked he had given up saying miss florence at her request
here's an advertisement that'll maybe suit you
show it to me dodger said florence beginning to show some interest
the boy directed her attention to the following advertisement there florence what do you say to that
that's better than sewin'
i don't know dodger whether i am competent
you play on the pianner don't you
yes
well enough to teach
i think so but i may not have the gift of teaching
yes you have
haven't you been teachin' me every evenin'
you make everything just as clear as mud no i don't mean that
you just explain so that i can't help understandin'
then said florence i suppose i am at liberty to refer to you
yes you can tell the lady to call at the office of dodger esq any mornin' after sunrise and he'll give her full particulars
florence did not immediately decide to apply for the situation but the more she thought of it the more she felt inclined to do so
the little experience she had had with dodger satisfied her that she should enjoy teaching better than sewing or writing
accordingly an hour later she put on her street dress and went uptown to the address given in the advertisement
no
was a handsome brown stone house not unlike the one in which florence had been accustomed to live
it was a refreshing contrast to the poor tenement in which she lived at present
is mrs leighton at home
inquired florence
yes miss answered the servant respectfully
whom shall i say
i have come to apply for the situation of governess answered florence feeling rather awkward as she made the statement
ah said the servant with a perceptible decline in respect
won't you step in
thank you
well she do dress fine for a governess said nancy to herself
it's likely she'll put on airs
the fact was that florence was dressed according to her past social position in a costly street attire but it had never occurred to her that she was too well dressed for a governess
she took her seat in the drawing room and five minutes later there was a rustling heard and mrs leighton walked into the room
are you the applicant for the position of governess
she asked surveying the elegantly attired young lady seated on the sofa
yes mrs leighton answered florence easily for she felt more at home in a house like this than in the tenement
have you taught before
very little answered florence smiling to herself as she wondered what mrs leighton would say if she could see dodger the only pupil she ever had
however i like teaching and i like children
pardon me but you don't look like a governess miss linden suggested florence filling out the sentence
do governesses have a peculiar look
i mean as to dress
you are more expensively dressed than the average governess can afford
it is only lately that my circumstances required me to support myself
i should not be able to buy such a dress out of my present earnings
i am glad to hear you say that for i do not propose to give a large salary
i do not expect one said florence quietly
you consider yourself competent to instruct in music french and the english branches
oh yes
do you speak french
yes madam
would you favor me with a specimen of your piano playing
there was a piano in the back parlor
florence removed her gloves and taking a seat before it dashed into a spirited selection from strauss
mrs leighton listened with surprised approval
certainly you are a fine performer she said
what if i should engage you would you expect in the way of compensation
how much time would you expect me to give
three hours daily from nine to twelve
i hardly know what to say
what did you expect to pay
about fifty cents an hour
florence knew very well from the sums that had been paid for her own education that this was miserably small pay but it was much more than she could earn by sewing
i will teach a month on those terms she said after a pause
mrs leighton looked well pleased
she knew that she was making a great bargain
oh by the way she said can you give references
i can refer you to madam morrison naming the head of a celebrated female seminary
she educated me
that will be quite satisfactory said mrs leighton graciously
can you begin to morrow
yes madam
you will then see your pupil
at present she is out
florence bowed and withdrew
she had been afraid mrs leighton would inquire where she lived and she would hardly dare to name the humble street which she called home
she walked toward fifth avenue when just as she was turning the corner she met mr percy de brabazon swinging a slender cane and dressed in the extreme of the fashion
miss linden
he exclaimed eagerly
this is aw indeed a pleasure
where are you walking this fine morning
may i aw have the pleasure of accompanying you
florence stopped short in deep embarrassment
chapter xii
a friend though a dude
percy de brabazon looked sincerely glad to meet florence and she herself felt some pleasure in meeting one who reminded her of her former life
but it was quite impossible that she should allow him to accompany her to her poor home on the east side
thank you mr de brabazon but my engagements this morning will hardly permit me to accept your escort she said
i suppose that means that you are going shopping but i don't mind it i assure you and i will carry your bundles he added magnanimously
that would never do
what
the fashionable mr de brabazon carrying bundles
you would lose your social status
i don't mind miss florence as long as you give me aw an approving smile
i will give it now as i bid you good morning
may i aw have the pleasure of calling upon you to morrow evening miss linden
it is evident that you have not heard that i am no longer residing with my uncle
mr de brabazon looked surprised
no i had not heard
may i ask aw where you are wesiding
with friends answered florence briefly
as you are a friend and will be likely to hear it i may as well mention that my uncle is displeased with me and has practically disowned me
then miss florence said mr de brabazon eagerly won't you accept aw my heart and hand
my mother will be charmed to receive you and i aw will strive to make you happy
i appreciate your devotion i do indeed mr de brabazon said florence earnestly but i must decline your offer
i will not marry without love
i don't mind that said percy if you'll agree to take a feller you'll learn in time to like him a little
i am wich i know you don't care for that but i can give you as good a home as your uncle
if you would give me hope aw i am afraid i cannot mr de brabazon but if you will allow me to look upon you as a friend i will call upon you if i have need of a friend's services
will you weally
yes there is my hand on it
i ought to tell you that i must now earn my own living and am to give lessons to a young pupil in west street three hours daily
you don't mean to say you are actually poor
said mr de brabazon horrified
yes indeed i am
then won't you let me lend you some money
i've got more than i need i have 'pon my honor
thank you i promise to call upon you if i need it
mr de brabazon looked pleased
would you mind telling me where you are going to teach miss florence
florence hesitated but there was something so sincere and friendly in the young man's manner dude though he was that she consented to grant his request
i am to teach the daughter of mr robert leighton
why miss leighton is my cousin said percy in joyous excitement
indeed
had i known that i would hardly have told you
don't be afwaid
i will be vewy discreet said mr de brabazon
thank you and good morning
florence went on her way cheered and encouraged in spite of herself by her success in obtaining employment and by the friendly offers of mr de brabazon
it is wrong to get discouraged she said to herself
after all there are warm hearts in the world
when she entered her humble home she found dodger already there
there was an eagerness in his manner and a light in his eye that seemed to indicate good news
well dodger what is it
i've been waitin' half an hour to see you florence he said
i've got some work for you
what is it sewing on a button or mending a coat
no i mean workin' for money
you can play on the pianner can't you
yes
they want a young lady to play the pianner at a dime museum for nine dollars a week
it's a bully chance
i just told the manager he's a friend of mine that i had a young lady friend that was a stunnin' player and he wants you to come around and see him
it was a preposterous idea so florence thought that she should consent to play at such a place but she couldn't expect dodger to look at the matter in the same light so she answered very gently and pleasantly you are very kind dodger to look out for me but i shall not need to accept your friend's offer
i have secured a chance to teach uptown
you have
what'll you get
i am to be employed three hours daily at fifty cents an hour
geewhillikens
that's good
you'd have to work as much as twelve hours at the museum for the same pay
you see therefore that i am provided for that is if i suit
dodger was a little disappointed
still he could not help admitting that it would be better for florence to teach three hours than to work ten or twelve
as to her having any objection to appearing at a dime museum that never occurred to him
florence had sent for her trunk and it was now in her room
dodger accompanied an expressman to the house and luckily saw jane who arranged everything for him
how's the old gentleman
asked dodger
florence wanted me to ask
he's feeble said jane shaking her head
does he miss florence
that he do
why don't he send for her then to come back
asked dodger bluntly
because curtis waring makes him believe she'll come around and ask forgiveness if he only holds out
i tell you dodger that curtis is a viper
so he is answered dodger who was not quite clear in his mind as to what a viper was
i'd like to step on his necktie
if it wasn't for him my dear young mistress would be back in the house within twenty four hours
i don't see how the old gentleman can let him turn florence out of the house
he's a snake in the grass dodger
it may be wicked but i just wish something would happen to him
and how is miss florence lookin' poor dear
she's lookin' like a daisy
does she worry much
she did at first but now she's workin' every day and she looks more cheerful like
miss florence workin'
she that was always brought up like a lady
she's teachin' a little girl three hours a day
well that isn't so bad
said jane relieved
teachin' is genteel
i wish i could see her some day
will you tell her dodger that next sunday is my day out and i'll be in central park up by the menagerie at three o'clock if she'll only take the trouble to be up there
i'll tell her jane and i'm sure she'll be there
a day or two afterward curtis waring asked have you heard from my cousin florence since she went away
yes sir
indeed
where is she staying
she didn't send me word
how then did you hear from her
dodger came with an expressman for her trunk
curtis waring frowned
and you let him have it
he demanded sternly
of course i did
why shouldn't i
you should have asked me
and what business have you with miss florence's trunk i'd like to know
said jane independently
never mind you ought to have asked my permission
i didn't think you'd want to wear any of miss florence's things mr
waring
you are silly and impertinent said curtis biting his lips
did that boy tell you anything about her
only that she wasn't worryin' any for you mr
curtis
curtis glanced angrily at his cousin's devoted friend and then turning on his heel left the room
i'll bring her to terms yet he muttered
no girl of seventeen shall defy me
chapter xiii
tim bolton's saloon
not far from houston street on the west side of the bowery is an underground saloon with whose proprietor we are already acquainted
it was kept by tim bolton whose peculiar tastes and shady characteristics well fitted him for such a business
it was early evening and the gas jets lighted up a characteristic scene
on the sanded floor were set several tables around which were seated a motley company all of them with glasses of beer or whiskey before them
tim with a white apron on was moving about behind the bar ministering to the wants of his patrons
there was a scowl upon his face for he was not fond of work and he missed dodger's assistance
the boy understood the business of mixing drinks as well as he and often officiated for hours at a time thus giving his guardian and reputed father a chance to leave the place and meet outside engagements
a tall erect gentleman entered the saloon and walked up to the bar
good evening colonel said tim
good evening sir said the newcomer with a stately inclination of the head
he was really a colonel having served in the civil war at the head of a georgia regiment
he had all the stately courtesy of a southern gentleman though not above the weakness of a frequent indulgence in the strongest fluids dispensed by tim bolton
what'll you have colonel
whiskey straight sir
it's the only drink fit for a gentleman
will you join me mr
bolton
of course i will said tim as pouring out a glass for himself he handed the bottle to the colonel
your health sir said the colonel bowing
same to you colonel responded tim with a nod
where's the boy
col martin had always taken considerable notice of dodger being naturally fond of boys and having once had a son of his own who was killed in a railroad accident when about dodger's age
danged if i know
answered tim crossly
he hasn't left you has he
yes he's cleared out the ungrateful young imp
i'd like to lay my hands on the young rascal
was he your son
he was my stepson answered tim hesitating
i see you married his mother
yes said tim considering the explanation satisfactory and resolved to adopt it
i've always treated him as if he was my own flesh and blood and i've raised him from a young kid
now he's gone and left me
can you think of any reason for his leaving you
not one
i always treated him well
he's been a great expense to me and now he's got old enough to help me he must clear out
he's the most ungrateful cub i ever seen
i am sorry he has gone i used to like to have him serve me
and now what's the consequence
here i am tied down to the bar day and night
can't you get some one in his place
yes but i'd likely be robbed i had a bartender once who robbed me of two or three dollars a day
but you trusted the boy
yes dodger wouldn't steal i can say that much for him
there's one thing i noticed about the boy said the colonel reflectively
he wouldn't drink
more than once i have asked him to drink with me but he would always say 'thank you colonel but i don't like whiskey'
i never asked him to take anything else for whiskey's the only drink fit for a gentleman
do you expect to get the boy back
if i could only get out for a day i'd hunt him up but i'm tied down here
i seed him yesterday tim said a red nosed man who had just entered the saloon in company with a friend of the same general appearance
both wore silk hats dented and soiled with stains of dirt coats long since superannuated and wore the general look of barroom loafers
they seldom had any money but lay in wait for any liberal stranger in the hope of securing a free drink
where did you see him hooker
asked tim bolton with sudden interest
selling papers down by the astor house
think of that colonel
said tim disgusted
becomin' a common newsboy when he might be in a genteel employment
did you speak to him hooker
yes i asked him if he had left you
what did he say
that he had left you for good that he was going to grow up respectable
think of that
said tim with renewed disgust
did he say where he lived
no
did he ask after me
no except he said that you were no relation of his
he said he expected you stole him when he was a kid and he hoped some time to find his relations
tim bolton's face changed color and he was evidently disturbed
could the boy have heard anything
he wondered for his suspicions were very near the truth
it's all nonsense
he said roughly
next time you see him hooker foller him home and find out where he lives
all right tim
it ought to be worth something he insinuated with a husky cough
that's so
what'll you take
whiskey answered hooker with a look of pleased anticipation
you're a gentleman tim he said as he gulped down the contents of a glass without winking
briggs his dilapidated companion had been looking on in thirsty envy
i'll help hooker to look for dodger he said
very well briggs
couldn't you stand a glass for me too tim
asked briggs eagerly
no answered bolton irritably
i've been at enough expense for that young rascal already
but the colonel noticed the pathetic look of disappointment on the face of briggs and he was stirred to compassion
drink with me sir he said turning to the overjoyed briggs
thank you colonel
you're a gentleman
two glasses tim
so the colonel drained a second glass and briggs pouring out with trembling fingers as much as he dared followed suit
when the last drop was drunk he breathed a deep sigh of measureless enjoyment
if either of you bring that boy in here said tim i'll stand a couple of glasses for both
we're your men tim said hooker
ain't we briggs
that's so hooker
shake
and the poor victims of drink shook hands energetically
long since they had sunk their manhood in the intoxicating cup and henceforth lived only to gratify their unnatural craving for what would sooner or later bring them to a drunkard's grave
as they left the saloon the colonel turned to tim and said i like whiskey sir but i'll be hanged if i can respect such men as those
they're bums colonel that's what they are
how do they live
don't know
they're in here about every day
if it's drink that's brought them where they are i'm half inclined to give it up but after all it isn't necessary to make a beast of yourself
i always drink like a gentleman sir
so you do colonel
at that moment a poor woman in a faded calico dress with a thin shawl over her shoulders descended the steps that led into the saloon and walked up to the bar
has my husband been here to night
she asked
tim bolton frowned
who's your husband
he asked roughly
wilson
no bill wilson hasn't been here to night
even if he had you have no business to come after him
i don't want any sniveling women here
i couldn't help it mr bolton said the woman putting her apron to her eyes
if bill comes in won't you tell him to come home
the baby's dead and we haven't a cent in the house
even tim was moved by this
i'll tell him he said
take a drink yourself you don't look strong
it shan't cost you a cent
no said the woman not a drop
it has ruined my happiness and broken up our home
not a drop
here my good lady said the colonel with chivalrous deference you have no money
take this and he handed the astonished woman a five dollar bill
heaven bless you sir
she exclaimed fervently
allow me to see you to the street and the gallant southern gentleman escorted her up to the sidewalk
i'd like to horsewhip that woman's husband
don't you sell him another drop
he said when he returned
chapter xiv
the missing will
an hour after the depart of the colonel there was an unexpected arrival
a well dressed gentleman descended the stairs gingerly looked about him with fastidious disdain and walked up to the bar
tim bolton was filling an order and did not immediately observe him
when at length he turned around he exclaimed in some surprise mr
waring
yes bolton i have found my way here
i have been expecting you
i came to you for some information
well ask your questions i don't know whether i can answer them
first where is my cousin florence
how should i know
she wasn't likely to place herself under my protection
she's with that boy of yours dodger i believe you call him
where is he
run away answered bolton briefly
do you mean that you don't know where he is
yes i do mean that
i haven't set my eyes on him since that night
what do you mean by such negligence
do you remember who he is
certainly i do
then why do you let him get of your reach
how could i help it
here i am tied down to this bar day and night
i'm nearly dead for want of sleep
it would be better to close up your place for a week and look after him
couldn't do it
i should lose all my trade
people would say i was closed up
and have you done nothing toward his recovery
yes i have sent out two men in search of him
have you any idea where he is or what he is doing
yes he has been seen in front of the astor house selling papers
i have authorized my agent if he sees him again to follow him home and find out where he lives
that is good
astor house
i may see him myself
but why do you want to see him
do you want to restore him to his rights
hush
said curtis glancing around him apprehensively
what we say may be overheard and excite suspicion
one thing may be secured by finding him the knowledge of florence's whereabouts
what makes you think she and the boy are together
he came for her trunk
i was away from home or i would not have let it go it is strange that they two are together considering their relationship
that is what i am afraid they will find out
she may tell him of the mysterious disappearance of her cousin and he that reminds me interrupted bolton
he told hooker hooker was the man that saw him in front of the astor house that he didn't believe i was his father
he said he thought i must have stolen him when he was a young kid
did he say that
asked curtis in evident alarm
yes so hooker says
if he has that idea in his head he may put two and two together and guess that he is the long lost cousin of florence
tim the boy must be got rid of
if you mean what i think you do mr waring i'm not with you
i won't consent to harm the boy
you said that before
i don't mean anything that will shock your tender heart bolton said curtis with a sneer
i mean carried to a distance europe or australia for instance
all i want is to keep him out of new york till my uncle is dead
after that i don't care what becomes of him
that's better
i've no objection to that
how is the old gentleman
he grieved so much at first over the girl's loss that i feared he would insist on her being recalled at once
i soothed him by telling him that he had only to remain firm and she would come around and yield to his wishes
do you think she will
asked tim doubtfully
i intend she shall
said curtis significantly
bolton i love the girl all the more for her obstinate refusal to wed me
i have made up my mind to marry her with her consent or without it
i thought it was only the estate you were after
i want the estate and her with it
mark my words bolton i will have both
you will have the estate no doubt mr linden has made his will in your favor has he not
and bolton looked intently in the face of his visitor
hark you bolton there is a mystery i cannot fathom
my uncle made two wills
in the earlier he left the estate to florence and myself if we married otherwise to me alone
that is satisfactory
yes but there was another in which the estate goes to the son if living
that will has disappeared
is it possible
asked bolton in astonishment
when was it missed
on the night of the burglary
then you think that the boy dodger has it
good heavens
if he only knew that by this will the estate goes to him
and waring wiped the perspiration from his brow
you are sure he did not give you the will
he demanded eying bolton sharply
i have not seen him since the night of the robbery
if he has read the will it may lead to dangerous suspicions
he would give it to your cousin florence would he not
perhaps so
bolton you must get the boy back and take the will from him if you can
i will do my best but you must remember that dodger is no longer a small kid
he is a boy of eighteen strong and well grown
he wouldn't be easy to manage
besides as long as he doesn't know that he has any interest in the will his holding it won't do any harm
is the old gentleman likely to live long
i don't know
i sometimes hope pshaw
why should i play the hypocrite when speaking to you
surely it is no sin to wish him better off since he can't enjoy life
he might if florence and his son were restored to him
what do you mean bolton
asked curtis suspiciously
what could i mean
it merely occurred to me said bolton innocently
you say he is quiet thinkin' the girl will come around
yes
suppose time passes and she doesn't
won't he try to find her
as she is in the city that won't be hard
i shall represent that she has left the city
for any particular point
no that is not necessary
and then
if he worries himself into the grave so much the better for me
there is no halfway about you mr curtis waring
why should there be
listen bolton i have set my all on this cast
i am now thirty six and still i am dependent upon my uncle's bounty
i am in debt and some of my creditors are disposed to trouble me
my uncle is worth i don't know how much but i think half a million
what does he get out of it
food and clothes but not happiness
if it were mine all the avenues of enjoyment would be open to me
that estate i must have
suppose you get it what is there for me
asked bolton
i will see that you are recompensed if you help me to it
will you put that in writing
do you take me for a fool
to put it in writing would be to place me in your power
you can trust me
well perhaps so said tim bolton slowly
at any rate you will have to
well good night
i will see you again
in the meantime try to find the boy
tim bolton followed him with his eyes as he left the saloon
what would he say said bolton to himself if he knew that the will he so much wishes to find is in my hands and that i hold him in my power already
chapter xv
the new governess
wish me luck dodger
so i do florence
are you goin' to begin teachin' this mornin'
yes and i hope to produce a favorable impression
it is very important to me to please mrs leighton and my future pupil
i'm sure you'll suit
how nice you look
florence smiled and looked pleased
she had taken pains with her dress and personal appearance and being luckily well provided with handsome dresses had no difficulty in making herself presentable
as she stepped out of the shabby doorway upon the sidewalk no one supposed her to be a tenant but she was generally thought to be a visitor perhaps the agent of some charitable association
perhaps all will not judge me as favorably as you do dodger said florence with a laugh
if you have the headache any day florence i'll take your place
you would look rather young for a tutor dodger and i am afraid you would not be dignified
good morning
i shall be back to dinner
i am glad to find you punctual miss linden said mrs leighton as florence was ushered into her presence
this is your pupil my daughter carrie
florence smiled and extended her hand
i hope we will like each other she said
the little girl eyed her with approval
this beautiful young lady was a pleasant surprise to her for never having had a governess she expected to meet a stiff elderly lady of stern aspect
she readily gave her hand to florence and looked relieved
carrie said mrs leighton you may show miss linden the way to the schoolroom
all right mamma and the little girl led the way upstairs to a back room on the third floor
so this is to be our schoolroom is it carrie
said florence
it is a very pleasant room
yes but i should have preferred the front chamber
mamma thought that i might be looking into the street too much
here there is only a back yard and nothing to look at
your mamma seems very judicious said florence smiling
are you fond of study
well i ain't exactly fond but i will do my best
that is all that can be expected
do you know miss linden you don't look at all like i expected
am i to be glad or sorry for that
i thought you would be an old maid stiff and starched like may robinson's governess
i am not married carrie so perhaps you may regard me as an old maid
you'll never be an old maid said carrie confidently
you are too young and pretty
thank you carrie said florence with a little blush
you say that i hope because you are going to like me
i like you already said the little girl impulsively
i've got a cousin that will like you too
a young girl
no of course not
he is a young man
his name is percy de brabazon
it is a funny name isn't it
you see his father was a frenchman
florence was glad that she already knew from percy's own mouth of the relationship as it saved her from showing a degree of surprise that might have betrayed her acquaintance with the young man
what makes you think your cousin would like me carrie
because he always likes pretty girls
he is a masher
that's slang carrie
i am sure your mamma wouldn't approve your using such a word
don't tell her
it just slipped out
but about percy he wants very much to be married
florence was not surprised to hear this for she had the best reason for knowing it to be true
is he a handsome young man
she asked demurely
he's funny looking
he's awful good natured but he isn't the sort of young man i would like concluded carrie with amusing positiveness
i hope you don't let your mind run on such things
you are quite too young
oh i don't think much about it
but percy is a dude
he spends a sight for clothes
he always looks as if he had just come out of a bandbox
is he in any business
no he has an independent fortune so mamma says
he was in europe last year
i think carrie we must give up talking and attend to business
i should have checked you before but i thought a little conversation would help us to get acquainted
now show me your books and i will assign your lessons
don't give me too long lessons please miss linden
i will take care not to task you beyond your strength
i don't want my pupil to grow sick on my hands
i hope you won't be too strict
when may robinson makes two mistakes her governess makes her learn her lessons over again
i will promise not to be too strict
now let me see your books
the rest of the forenoon was devoted to study
florence was not only an excellent scholar but she had the art of imparting knowledge and what is very important she was able in a few luminous words to explain difficulties and make clear what seemed to her pupil obscure
so the time slipped quickly and pleasantly away and it was noon before either she or her pupil realized it
it can't be twelve said carrie surprised
yes it is
we must defer further study till to morrow
why it is a great deal pleasanter than going to school miss linden
i dreaded studying at home but now i like it
i hope you will continue to carrie
i can say that the time has passed away pleasantly for me
as florence prepared to resume her street dress carrie said oh i forgot
mamma asked me to invite you to stay to lunch with me
i take lunch as soon as school is out at twelve o'clock so i won't detain you long
thank you carrie i will stay with pleasure
i am glad of that for i don't like to sit down to the table alone
mamma is never here at this time
she goes out shopping or making calls so poor i have to sit down to the table alone
it will be ever so much pleasure to have you with me
florence was by no means sorry to accept the invitation
the meals she got at home were by no means luxurious and the manner of serving them was by no means what she enjoyed
mrs o'keefe though a good friend and a kindhearted woman was not a model housekeeper and florence had been made fastidious by her early training
lunch was of course a plain meal but what was furnished was of the best quality and the table service was such as might be expected in a luxurious home
just as florence was rising from the table mrs leighton entered the room in street dress
i am glad you remained to lunch miss linden she said
you will be company for my little girl who is very sociable
carrie i hope you were a good girl and gave miss linden no trouble
ask miss linden mamma said carrie confidently
indeed she did very well said florence
i foresee that we shall get along admirably
i am glad to hear that
she is apt to be indolent
i won't be with miss linden mamma
she makes the studies so interesting
after florence left the house carrie pronounced an eulogium upon her which led mrs leighton to congratulate herself upon having secured a governess who had produced so favorable an impression on her little girl
was you kept after school florence
asked dodger as she entered her humble home
i am afraid you'll find your dinner cold
never mind dodger
i am to take dinner or lunch rather at the house where i am teaching so hereafter mrs o'keefe need not wait for me
and how do you like your place
it is everything that is pleasant
you wished me good luck dodger and your wish has been granted
i was lucky too florence
i've made a dollar and a quarter this mornin'
not by selling papers surely
not all
a gentleman gave me fifty cents for takin' his valise to the long branch boat
it seems we are both getting rich said florence smiling
chapter xvi
dodger becomes ambitious
ah there dodger
dodger who had been busily and successfully selling evening papers in front of the astor house turned quickly as he heard his name called
his glance rested on two men dressed in soiled white hats and shabby suits who were apparently holding each other up having both been imbibing
he at once recognized hooker and briggs for he had waited upon them too many times in tim's saloon not to recognize them
well he said cautiously what do you want
tim has sent us for you
answered the two in unison
what does he want of me
he wants you to come home
he says he can't get along without you
he will have to get along without me said the boy independently
tell him i'm not goin' back
you're wrong dodger said hooker shaking his head solemnly
ain't he your father
no he ain't
he says he is continued hooker looking puzzled
that don't make it so
he ought to know put in briggs
yes he ought to know
chimed in hooker
no doubt he does but he can't make me believe he's any relation of mine
just go and argy the point with him said hooker coaxingly
it wouldn't do no good
maybe it would
just go back with us that's a good boy
what makes you so anxious about it
asked dodger suspiciously
well said hooker coughing we're tim's friends don't you know
what's he goin' to give you if i go back with you
asked the boy shrewdly
a glass of whiskey
replied hooker and briggs in unison
is that all
maybe he'd make it two
i won't go back with you said dodger after a moment's thought but i don't want you to lose anything by me
here's a dime apiece and you can go and get a drink somewhere else
you're a trump dodger said hooker eagerly holding out his hand
i always liked you dodger said briggs with a similar motion
now don't let tim know you've seen me said the newsboy warningly
we won't
and the interesting pair ambled off in the direction of the bowery
so tim sent them fellers after me
soliloqized dodger
i guess i'll have to change my office or maybe tim himself will be droppin' down on me some mornin'
it'll be harder to get rid of him than of them chumps
so it happened that he used to take down his morning papers to the piers on the north river and take his chance of selling them to passengers from boston and others ports arriving by the fall river boats and others from different points
the advantage of this was that he often got a chance to serve as guide to strangers visiting the city for the first time or as porter to carry their valise or other luggage
being a bright wideawake boy with a pleasant face and manner he found his services considerably in demand and on counting up his money at the end of the week he found much to his encouragement that he had received on an average about a dollar and twenty five cents per day
that's better than sellin' papers alone thought he
besides tim isn't likely to come across me here
i wonder i didn't think of settin' up for myself before
in the evening he spent an hour and sometimes more pursuing his studies under the direction of florence
at first his attention was given chiefly to improving his reading and spelling for dodger was far from fluent in the first while his style of spelling many words was strikingly original
ain't i stupid florence
he asked one day after spelling a word of three syllables with such ingenious incorrectness as to convulse his young teacher with merriment
not at all dodger
you are making excellent progress but sometimes you are so droll that i can't help laughing
i don't mind that if you think i am really gettin' on
undoubtedly you are
i make a great many mistakes said dodger dubiously
yes you do but you must remember that you have taken lessons only a short time
don't you think you can read a good deal more easily than you did
yes i don't trip up half so often as i did
i'm afraid you'll get tired of teachin' me
no fear of that dodger
as long as i see that you are improving i shall feel encouraged to go on
i wish i knew as much as your other scholar
you will in time if you go on
you mustn't get discouraged
i won't
said dodger stoutly
if a little gal like her can learn i'd ought to be ashamed if i don't a big boy of eighteen
it isn't the size of the boy that counts dodger
i know that but i ain't goin' to give in and let a little gal get ahead of me
keep to that determination dodger and you will succeed in time never fear
on the whole florence enjoyed both her pupils
she had the faculty of teaching and she became very much interested in both
as for dodger she thought rough diamond as he was that she saw in him the making of a manly man and she felt that it was a privilege to assist in the development of his intellectual nature
again he had picked up a good deal of slang from the nature of his associates and she set to work to improve his language and teach him refinement
it was necessarily a slow process but she began to find after a time that a gradual change was coming over him
i want you to grow up a gentleman dodger she said to him one day
i'm too rough for that florence
i'm only an ignorant street boy
you are not going to be an ignorant street boy all your life
i don't see why you should not grow up a polished gentleman
i shall never be like that de brabazon young man said he
no dodger i don't think you will said florence laughing
i don't want you to become effeminate nor a dude
i think i would like you less than i do now
do you like me florence
asked dodger brightening up
to be sure i do
i hope you don't doubt it
why it don't seem natural like
you're a fashionable young lady not very fashionable dodger just at present
well a high toned young lady one of the tip tops and i am a rough bowery boy
you were once but you are getting over that rapidly
did you ever hear of andy johnson
who was he
he became president of the united states
well at the age of twenty one he could neither read nor write
at twenty one
repeated dodger
why i'm only eighteen and i do know something of readin' and writin'
to be sure
well andy johnson was taught to read and write by his wife
he kept on improving himself till in course of time he became a united states senator vice president and afterward president
now i don't expect you to equal him but i see no reason why you should not become a well educated man if you are content to work and keep on working
i will keep on florence said dodger earnestly
if i ever find my relations i don't want them to be ashamed of me
it was not the first time he had referred to his uncertain origin
won't tim bolton tell you anything about your family
no i've asked him more'n once
he always says he's my father and that makes me mad
it is strange said florence thoughtfully
i had a young cousin stolen many years ago
was it the son of the old gentleman you lived with on madison avenue
yes it was the son of uncle john
it quite broke him down
after my cousin's loss he felt that he had nothing to live for
i wish i was your cousin florence said dodger thoughtfully
well then i will adopt you as my cousin or brother whichever you prefer
i would rather be your cousin
then cousin let it be
now we are bound to each other by strong and near ties
but when your uncle takes you back you'll forget all about poor dodger
no i won't dodger
there's my hand on it
whatever comes we are friends forever
then i'll try not to disgrace you florence
i'll learn as fast as i can and see if i don't grow up to be a gentleman
chapter xvii
a mysterious adventure
several weeks passed without changing in any way the position or employment of dodger or florence
they had settled down to their respective forms of labor and were able not only to pay their modest expenses but to save up something for a rainy day
florence had but one source of regret
she enjoyed her work and did not now lament the luxurious home which she had lost
but she did feel sore at heart that her uncle made no sign of regret for their separation
from him she received no message of forgiveness or reconciliation
he has forgotten me
she said to herself bitterly
he has cast me utterly out of his heart
i do not care for his money but i do not like to think that my kind uncle for he was always kind till the last trouble has steeled his heart against me forever
but she learned through a chance meeting with jane that this was not so
mr linden is getting very nervous and low spirited said the girl and sits hour after hour in the library looking into the fire a fotchin' deep sighs every few minutes
once i saw him with your photograph the one you had taken last spring in his hands and he looked sad like when he laid it down
my dear uncle
then he does think of me sometimes
it's my belief he'd send for you if curtis would let him
surely curtis cannot exercise any restraint upon him
he has frequent talks with the old gentleman
i don't know what he says but it's sure to be something wicked
i expect he does all he can to set him against you
oh he's a cunning villain he is even if he is your cousin miss florence
and do you think my uncle is unhappy jane
said florence thoughtfully
that i do miss
he never was very bright or cheerful you know
but he never was like this
and i do think he's gettin' more and more feeble
do you think i ought to call upon him and risk his sending me away
it might be worth tryin' miss florence
the result of this conversation was that florence did make up her mind the very next afternoon to seek her old home
she had just reached the front steps and was about to ascend when the door opened and curtis appeared
he started at sight of his cousin
florence
he said
tell me why you came here
i am anxious about my uncle she said
tell me curtis how he is
you know he's never in vigorous health said curtis evasively
but is he as well as usual
he is about the same as ever
one thing would do more for him than anything else
what's that
your agreement to marry me and he fixed his eyes upon her face eagerly
florence shook her head
i should be glad to help my uncle she said but i cannot agree to marry you
why not
he demanded roughly
because i do not love you and never shall she responded firmly
in other words you refuse to do the only thing that will restore our uncle to health and happiness
it is too much to ask
then fixing her eyes upon him keenly why should uncle insist upon this marriage
is it not because you have influenced him in the matter
no answered curtis falsely
he has some secret reason which he will not disclose to me for desiring it
florence had learned to distrust the words of her wily cousin
may i not see him
she asked
perhaps he will tell me
no i cannot permit it
you cannot permit it
are you then our uncle's guardian
no and yes
i do not seek to control him but i wish to save him from serious agitation
should he see you and find that you are still rebellious the shock might kill him
i have reason to doubt your words said florence coldly
i think you are resolved to keep us apart
listen and i will tell you a secret uncle john has heart disease so the doctor assures me
any unwonted agitation might kill him instantly
i am sure you would not like to expose him to such a risk
he spoke with apparent sincerity but florence did not feel certain that his words were truthful
very well she said
then i will give up seeing him
it is best unless you are ready to accede to his wishes and mine
she did not answer but walked away slowly
it would never do to have them meet
muttered curtis
the old gentleman would ask her to come back on any terms and then all my scheming would be upset
that was a happy invention of mine about heart disease he continued with a low laugh
though she only half believed it she will not dare to run the risk of giving him a shock
it was about this time that the quiet tenor of dodger's life was interrupted by a startling event
he still continued to visit the piers and one afternoon about six o'clock he stood on the pier awaiting the arrival of the day boat from albany with a small supply of evening papers under his arm
he had sold all but half a dozen when the boat touched the pier
he stood watching the various passengers as they left the boat and turned their steps in different directions when some one touched him on the shoulder
looking up he saw standing at his side a man of slender figure with gray hair and whiskers
boy he said i am a stranger in the city
can i ask your assistance
yes sir certainly answered dodger briskly
do you know where the nearest station of the elevated road is
yes sir
i want to go uptown but i know very little about the city
will you accompany me as guide
i will pay you well
all right sir answered dodger
it was just the job he was seeking
we will have to walk a few blocks unless you want to take a carriage
it isn't necessary
i am strong in spite of my gray hair
and indeed he appeared to be
dodger noticed that he walked with the elastic step of a young man while his face certainly showed no trace of wrinkles
i live in the west said the stranger as they walked along
i have not been here for ten years
then you have never ridden on the elevated road
said dodger
n no answered the stranger with curious hesitation
yet when they reached the station he went up the staircase and purchased his ticket with the air of a man who was thoroughly accustomed to doing it
i suppose you don't want me any longer said dodger preparing to resign the valise he was carrying and which by the way was remarkably light considering the size
yes i shall need you said the other hurriedly
there may be some distance to walk after we get uptown
all right sir
dodger was glad that further service was required for this would of course increase the compensation which he would feel entitled to ask
they entered one of the cars and sat down side by side
the old gentleman drew a paper from his pocket and began to read while dodger left to his own devices sat quiet and looked about him
he was rather surprised that the old gentleman who according to his own representation was riding upon the elevated road for the first time seemed to feel no curiosity on the subject but conducted himself in all respects like an experienced traveler
he's a queer customer
thought dodger
however it's all one to me as long as he pays me well for the job
they got out at one hundred and twenty fifth street and struck down toward the river dodger carrying the valise
i wonder where we're going
he asked himself
at length they reached a wooden house of three stories standing by itself and here the stranger stopped
he rang the bell and the door was opened by a hump backed negro who looked curiously at dodger
is the room ready julius
asked the old man
yes sir
boy take the valise upstairs and i will follow you
up two flights of stairs walked dodger followed by the old man and the negro
the latter opened the door of a back room and dodger obedient to directions took the valise inside and deposited it on a chair
he had hardly done so when the door closed behind him and he heard the slipping of a bolt
what does all this mean
dodger asked himself in amazement
chapter xviii
in a trap
hold on there
open that door
he exclaimed aloud
there was no answer
i say let me out
continued our hero beginning to kick at the panels
this time there was an answer
stop that kicking boy
i will come back in fifteen minutes and explain all
well thought dodger this is about the strangest thing that ever happened to me
however i can wait fifteen minutes
he sat down on a cane chair there were two in the room and looked about him
he was in an ordinary bedroom furnished in the usual manner
there was nothing at all singular in its appearance
on a book shelf were a few books and some old numbers of magazines
there was one window looking into a back yard but as the room was small it was sufficient to light the apartment
dodger looked about in a cursory manner not feeling any particular interest in his surroundings for he had but fifteen minutes to wait but he thought it rather queer that it should be thought necessary to lock him in
he waited impatiently for the time to pass
seventeen minutes had passed when he heard the bolt drawn
fixing his eyes eagerly on the door he saw it open and two persons entered
one was the hump backed negro carrying on a waiter a plate of buttered bread and a cup of tea the other person was not the old man but to dodger's great amazement a person well remembered though he had only seen him once curtis waring
set down the waiter on the table julius said waring
dodger looked on in stupefaction
he was getting more and more bewildered
now you can go
said curtis in a tone of authority
the negro bowed and after he had disposed of the waiter withdrew
do you know me boy
asked curtis turning now and addressing dodger
yes you are mr
waring
you remember where you last saw me
yes sir
at your uncle's house on madison avenue
quite right
how did you come here
where is the old man whose valise i brought from the albany boat
curtis smiled and drew from his pocket a gray wig and whiskers
you understand now don't you
yes sir i understand that i have been got here by a trick
yes answered curtis coolly
i have deemed it wise to use a little stratagem
but you must be hungry
sit down and eat your supper while i am talking to you
dodger was hungry for it was past his usual supper time and he saw no reason why he should not accept the invitation
accordingly he drew his chair up to the table and began to eat
curtis seated himself on the other chair
i have a few questions to ask you and that is why i arranged this interview
we are quite by ourselves he added significantly
very well sir go ahead
where is my cousin florence
i am right i take it in assuming that you know where she is
yes sir i know answered dodger slowly
very well tell me
i don't think she wants you to know
curtis frowned
it is necessary i should know
he said emphatically
i will ask her if i may tell you
i can't wait for that
you must tell me at once
i can't do that
you are mistaken you can do it
then i won't
said dodger looking his companion full in the face
curtis waring darted a wicked look at him and seemed ready to attack the boy who was audacious enough to thwart him but he restrained himself and said let that pass for the present
i have another question to ask
where is the document you took from my uncle's desk on the night of the burglary
and he emphasized the last word
dodger looked surprised
i took no paper he said
do you deny that you opened the desk
asked curtis
no
when i came to examine the contents in the presence of my uncle it was found that a document his will had disappeared and with it a considerable sum of money
and he looked sharply at dodger
i don't know anything about it sir
i took nothing
you can hardly make me believe that
why did you open the desk if you did not propose to take anything
i did intend to take something
i was under orders to do so for i wouldn't have done it of my own free will but the moment i got the desk open i heard a cry and looking around i saw miss florence looking at me
and then
i was startled and ran to her side
and then you went back and completed the robbery
no i didn't
she talked to me so that i felt ashamed of it
i never stole before and i wouldn't have tried to do it then if if some one hadn't told me to
i know whom you mean tim bolton
yes tim bolton since you know
what did he tell you to take
the will and the money
eactly
now we are coming to it
you took them and gave them to him
no i didn't
i haven't seen him since that night
curtis waring regarded the boy thoughtfully
his story was straightforward and it agreed with the story told by tim himself
but on the other hand he denied taking the missing articles and yet they had disappeared
curtis decided that both he and tim had lied and that this story had been concocted between them
probably bolton had the will and the money the latter he did not care for and this thought made him uneasy for he knew that tim bolton was an unscrupulous man and quite capable of injuring him if he saw the way clear to do so
my young friend he said your story is not even plausible
the articles are missing and there was no one but yourself and florence who were in a position to take them
do you wish me to think that my cousin florence robbed the desk
no sir i don't
florence wouldn't do such a thing said dodger warmly
florence
is that the way you speak of a young lady
she tells me to call her florence
i used to call her miss florence but she didn't care for it
it seems you two have become very intimate said curtis with a sneer
florence is a good friend to me
i never had so good a friend before
all that is very affecting however it isn't to the point
do you know he continued in a sterner tone that i could have you arrested for entering and breaking open my uncle's desk with burglarious intent
i suppose you could said dodger but florence would testify that i took nothing
am i to understand then that you refuse to give me any information as to the will and the money
no sir i don't refuse
i would tell you if i knew
curtis regarded the boy in some perplexity
he had every appearance of telling the truth
dodger had one of those honest truthful countenances which lend confirmation to any words spoken
if the boy told the truth what could have become of the will and the money
as to the former it might be possible that his uncle had destroyed it but the disappearance of the money presented an independent difficulty
the will is all i care for he said at length
the thief is welcome to the money though there was a considerable sum
i would find the will for you if i could said dodger earnestly
you are positive you didn't give it to bolton
positive sir
i haven't seen tim since that night
you may be speaking the truth or you may not
i will talk with you again to morrow and curtis arose from his chair
you don't mean to keep me here
said dodger in alarm
i shall be obliged to do so
i won't stay
exclaimed dodger in excitement and he ran to the door meaning to get out but curtis drew a pistol from his pocket and aimed it at the boy
understand me boy he said i am in earnest and i am not to be trifled with
dodger drew back and curtis opened the door and went out bolting it after him
chapter xix
an attempt to escape
while dodger had no discomfort to complain of it occurred to him that florence would be alarmed by his long absence for now it seemed certain that he would have to remain overnight
if only he could escape he would take care not to fall into such a trap again
he went to the window and looked out but the distance to the ground was so great for the room was on the third floor that he did not dare to imperil his life by attempting a descent
if there had been a rope at hand he would not have felt afraid to make the attempt
he examined the bed to see if it rested upon cords but there were slats instead
as has already been said there were no houses near by
that part of the city had not been much settled and it was as solitary as it is in the outskirts of a country village
if he could only reveal his position to some person outside so as to insure interference he might yet obtain his freedom
with this thought he tore a blank leaf from one of the books in the room and hastily penciled the following lines some weeks before dodger could not have written so creditable a note but he had greatly improved since he had been under the influence and instruction of florence
dodger now posted himself at the window and waited anxiously for some one to pass so that he might attract his attention and throw down the paper
he had to wait for fifteen minutes
then he saw approaching a young man not far from twenty one who looked like a young mechanic returning from his daily work
now was dodger's opportunity
he put his head out of the window and called out hello there
the young man looked and saw him at the window
what do you want
he asked
catch this paper and read what there is on it
he threw down the leaf which after fluttering in the gentle evening breeze found its way to the ground and was picked up
after reading it the young man looked up and said i'll go around to the door and inquire
he was as good as his word
he went to the outer door and rang the bell
julius came to the door
what's wanted boss
he said
you've got a boy locked up in a room
who told you boss
he threw down a paper to me telling me he was kept a prisoner
what did he say
asked julius
the young man read the note aloud
what have to say to that you black imp
he demanded sternly
the ready wit of julius served him in this emergency
dat boy is crazy as a loon boss
he answered readily
we have to keep him shut up for fear he'll kill some of us
you don't say
ejaculated the young mechanic
he don't look like it
no he don't dat's a fact boss
fact is dat boy is the artfullest lunytick you ever seed
he tried to kill his mother last week
is that true
dat's so boss
and all de while he looks as innocent as a baby
if i was to let him out he'd kill somebody sure
i never would have believed it said the young man
if you want to take the risk boss you might go up and see him
i believe he's got a carvin' knife about him but i don't dare to go up and get it away
it would be as much as this niggah's life is worth
no answered the young man hastily
i don't want to see him
i never did like crazy folks
i'm sorry i gave you the trouble to come to the door
oh no trouble boss
i guess i've fixed dat boy
chuckled julius
ho ho
he can't get ahead of old julius
crazy as a loon ho ho
dodger waited anxiously for the young man to get through his interview
he hoped that he would force his way up to the third floor draw the bolt and release him from his imprisonment
he kept watch at the window and when the young man reappeared he looked at him eagerly
did you ask them to let me out
he shouted
the other looked up at him with an odd expression of suspicion and repulsion
you're better off where you are he said rather impatiently
but they have locked me up here
and reason enough too
what makes you say that
because you're crazy as a loon
did the black man say that
inquired dodger indignantly
yes he did said you tried to kill your mother and had a carving knife hidden in the room
it's a lie an outrageous lie
exclaimed dodger his eyes flashing
don't go into one of your tantrums said the man rather alarmed it won't do any good
but i want you to understand that i am no more crazy than you are
sho
i know better
where's your carving knife
i haven't got any i never had any
that negro has been telling you lies
just go to the door again and insist on seeing me
i wouldn't dast to
you'd stab me said the man fearfully
listen to me
said dodger getting out of patience
i'm not crazy
i'm a newsboy and baggage smasher
an old man got me to bring his valise here and then locked me up
won't you go around to the station house and send a policeman here
i'll see about it said the young man who did not believe a word that dodger had said to him
he won't do it
said dodger to himself in a tone of discouragement
that miserable nigger has made him believe i am a lunatic
i'll have him up anyway
forthwith he began to pound and kick so forcibly that julius came upstairs on a run half inclined to believe that dodger had really become insane
what do you want boy
he inquired from outside the door
i want you to unbolt the door and let me out
i couldn't do it nohow said julius
it would be as much as my place is worth
i will give you a dollar five dollars if you will only let me out
the man who brought me here is a bad man who is trying to cheat his cousin a young lady out of a fortune
don't know nothin' 'bout that said julius
he has no right to keep me here
don't know nothin' 'bout that either
i'm actin' accordin' to orders
look here said dodger bethinking himself of what had just happened
did you tell that young man who called here just now that i was crazy
julius burst into a loud guffaw
i expect i did he laughed
said you'd got a long carvin' knife hid in de room
what made you lie so
demanded dodger sternly
couldn't get rid of him no other way
oh how scared he looked when i told him you tried to kill your mother
and the negro burst into another hearty laugh which exasperated dodger exceedingly
how long is mr waring going to keep me here
did he tell you
dodger asked after a pause
no he didn't say
when is he coming here again
said he'd come to morrow most likely
will you bring me a light
couldn't do it
you'd set the house on fire
it seemed useless to prolong the conversation
dodger threw himself on the bed at an early hour but he did not undress thinking there might possibly be a chance to escape during the night
but the morning came and found him still a prisoner but not in the solitary dwelling
chapter xx
a midnight ride
curtis waring had entrapped dodger for a double purpose
it was not merely that he thought it possible the boy had the will or knew where it was
he had begun to think of the boy's presence in new york as dangerous to his plans
john linden might at any time learn that the son for whose appearance he had grieved so bitterly was still living in the person of this street boy
then there would be an end of his hopes of inheriting the estate
only a few months more and the danger would be over for he felt convinced that his uncle's tenure of life would be brief
the one essential thing then seemed to be to get dodger out of the city
the first step had already been taken what the next was will soon appear
scarcely had dodger failed in his attempt to obtain outside assistance when an unaccountable drowsiness overcame him considerably to his surprise
i don't know what's come to me he said to himself
it can't be more than seven or eight o'clock and yet i feel so sleepy i can hardly keep my eyes open
i haven't worked any harder than usual to day and i can't understand it
dodger had reason to be surprised for he didn't usually retire till eleven o'clock
in a city like new york where many of the streets are tolerably well filled even at midnight people get in the way of sitting up much later than in the country and dodger was no exception to this rule
yet here he was ready to drop off to sleep before eight o'clock
to him it was a mystery for he did not know that the cup of tea which he had drunk at supper had been drugged by direction of curtis waring with an ulterior purpose which will soon appear
i may as well lie down as there is nothing else to do thought dodger
there isn't much fun sitting in the dark
if i can sleep so much the better
five minutes had scarcely passed after his head struck the pillow when our hero was fast asleep
at eleven o'clock a hack stopped in front of the house and curtis waring descended from it
stay here he said to the driver
there will be another passenger
if you are detained i will make it right when i come to pay you
all right sir said the hackman
i don't care how long it is if i am paid for my time
curtis opened the door with a pass key and found julius dozing in a chair in the hall
wake up you sleepy head he said
has anything happened since i left here
yes sir the boy tried to get away
did he
i don't see how he could do that
you kept the door bolted didn't you
yes sir but he throwed a piece of paper out'n de window sayin' he was kep' a prisoner here
a young man picked it up and came to de house to ax about it
curtis looked alarmed
what did you say
he inquired apprehensively
told him de boy was crazy as a loon dat he tried to kill his mother las' week and had a carvin' knife hid in his room
good julius
i didn't give you credit for such a fertile imagination
what's dat massa
asked julius looking puzzled
i didn't know you were such a skillful liar
yah
yah
laughed julius quite comprehending this compliment
i reckon i can twis' de trufe pretty well massa curtis
you have done well julius said curtis approvingly
here's a dollar
the negro was quite effusive in his gratitude
what did the young man say
he looked scared
i tol' him he could go up and see de boy if he wasn't afeared of the carvin' knife but he said he guessed he wouldn't he didn't like crazy folks
curtis laughed heartily
so it all ended as it should
did the boy make any more trouble
yes he pounded and kicked till i had to go up and see what was the matter
i didn't give him no satisfaction and i guess he went to bed
he ought to be in a deep sleep by this time
i will go up and see
go up with me julius for i may have to ask you to help me bring him down
though julius was naturally a coward he felt quite brave when he had company and he at once went upstairs with curtis waring
curtis drew the bolt and entering the chamber his glance fell upon dodger fast asleep on the bed
i am glad the boy did not undress he said
it will save me a great deal of trouble
now julius you can take his feet and i will lift his head and we will take him downstairs
s'pos'n he wakes up massa curtis
he won't wake up
i took care the sleeping potion should be strong enough to produce profound slumber for eighteen hours
seems as if he was dead said julius nervously
tush you fool
he's no more dead than you or i
the hackman looked curious when the two men appeared with their sleeping burden and curtis felt that some explanation was required
the boy has a very painful disease he said and the doctor gave him a sleeping draught
he is going abroad for his health and under the circumstances i think it best not to wake him up
drive slowly and carefully to pier no
as i don't want the boy aroused if it can be helped
all right sir
julius you may lock the door and come with me
i shall need your help to get him on board the ship
all right massa curtis
and mind you don't go to sleep in the carriage you black rascal
added curtis as he saw that the negro found it hard to keep his eyes open
all right massa i'll keep awake
how am i to get home
i will instruct the hackman to take you home
yah yah i'll be ridin' like a gentleman
the journey was successfully accomplished but it took an hour for according to directions the hackman did not force his pace but drove slowly till he reached the north river pier indicated
at the pier was a large stanch vessel the columbia bound for san francisco around cape horn
all was dark but the second officer was pacing the deck
curtis waring hailed him
what time do you get off
early to morrow morning
so the captain told me
i have brought you a passenger
the captain told me about him
is his stateroom ready
yes sir
you are rather late
true and the boy is asleep as you will see
he is going to make the voyage for his health and as he has been suffering some pain i thought i would not wake him up
who will direct me to his stateroom
the mate summoned the steward and dodger still unconscious was brought on board and quietly transferred to the bunk that had been prepared for him
it was a critical moment for poor dodger but he was quite unconscious of it
what is the boy's name
asked the mate
arthur grant
the captain has it on his list
is he on board
yes but he is asleep
i do not need to see him
i have transacted all necessary business with him and paid the passage money
julius bring the valise
julius did so
this contains the boy's clothing
take it to the stateroom julius
all right massa curtis
what is your usual time between new york and san francisco
asked curtis addressing the mate
from four to six months
four months is very short six months very long
we ought to get there in five months or perhaps a little sooner with average weather
very well
i believe there is no more to be said
good night
good night sir
so he is well out of the way for five months
soliloquized curtis
in five months much may happen
before that time i hope to be in possession of my uncle's property
then i can snap my fingers at fate
chapter xxi
a seasick passenger
the good ship columbia had got fifty miles under way before dodger opened his eyes
he looked about him languidly at first but this feeling was succeeded by the wildest amazement as his eyes took in his unusual surroundings
he had gone to sleep on a bed he found himself on awakening in a ship's bunk
he half arose in his birth but the motion of the vessel and a slight feeling of dizziness compelled him to resume a recumbent position
i must be dreaming thought dodger
it's very queer
i am dreaming i am at sea
i suppose that explains it
he listened and heard the swish of the waters as they beat against the sides of the vessel
he noted the pitching of the ship and there was an unsteady feeling in his head such as those who have gone to sea will readily recall
dodger became more and more bewildered
if it's a dream it's the most real dream i ever had he said to himself
this seems like a ship's cabin he continued looking about him
i think if i got up i should be seasick
i wonder if people ever get seasick in dreams
there was another pitch and dodger instinctively clung to the edge of his berth to save himself from being thrown out
let me see he said trying to collect his scattered recollection
i went to sleep in a house uptown a house to which curtis waring lured me and then made me a prisoner
the house was somewhere near one hundred and twenty fifth street
now it seems as if i was on board a ship
how could i get here
i wish somebody would come in that i could ask
as no one came in dodger got out of the berth and tried to stand on the cabin floor
but before he knew it he was staggering like one intoxicated and his head began to feel bad partly no doubt on account of the sleeping potion which he had unconsciously taken
at this moment the steward entered the cabin
hello young man
have you got up
he asked
where am i
asked dodger looking at him with a dazed expression
where are you
you're on the good ship columbia to be sure
are we out to sea
of course you are
how far from land
well about fifty miles more or less i should judge
how long have i been here
it seems to me you have a poor memory
you came on board last evening
i suppose curtis waring brought me said dodger beginning to get his bearings
there was a gentleman came with you so the mate told me
i don't know his name
where is the ship bound
to san francisco around cape horn
i supposed you knew that
i never heard of the ship columbia before and i never had any idea of making a sea voyage
the steward looked surprised
i suppose your guardian arranged about that
didn't he tell you
i have no guardian
well you'll have to ask capt
barnes about that
i know nothing except that you are a passenger and that your fare has been paid
my fare paid to san francisco
asked dodger more and more at sea both mentally and physically
yes we don't take any deadheads on the columbia
can you tell me what time it is
about twelve o'clock
do you feel hungry
n not very returned dodger as a ghastly expression came over his face and he tumbled back into his berth looking very pale
the steward smiled
i see how it is he said you are getting initiated
what's that
muttered dodger feebly
you're going to be seasick
you'll hardly be able to appear at the dinner table
it makes me sick to think of eating said dodger feebly
as he sank back into his berth all thoughts of his unexpected position gave way to an overpowering feeling of seasickness
he had never been tried in this way before and he found the sensation far from agreeable
if only the vessel would stop pitching he groaned
oh how happy i should be if i were on dry land
but the vessel wouldn't stop even for a minute
the motion on the other hand seemed to increase as was natural for they were getting farther and farther from land and were exposed to the more violent winds that swept the open ocean
there is something about seasickness that swallows up and draws away all minor cares and anxieties and dodger was too much affected to consider how or why it was that he so unexpectedly found himself a passenger to california
lie flat on your back said the steward
you will feel better if you do
how long is it going to last
groaned dodger feeling quite miserable
oh you'll feel better to morrow
i'll bring you some porridge presently
you can get that down and it is better to have something on your stomach
he was right
the next day dodger felt considerably better and ventured to go upon deck
he looked about him in surprise
there had been a storm and the waves were white with foam
as far as the eye could see there was a tumult and an uproar
the ship was tossed about like a cockle shell
but the sailors went about their work unruffled
it was no new sight for them
though his head did not feel exactly right the strong wind entered dodger's lungs and he felt exhilarated
his eyes brightened and he began to share in the excitement of the scene
pacing the deck was a stout bronzed seaman whose dress made it clear even to the inexperienced eyes of dodger that he was the captain
good morning master grant he said pleasantly
are you getting your sea legs on
the name was unfamiliar to dodger but he could see that the remark was addressed to him
yes sir he answered
ever been to sea before
no sir
you'll get used to it
bless me you'll stand it like an old sailor before we get to 'frisco
is it a long voyage captain
asked dodger
five months probably
we may get there a little sooner
it depends on the winds and weather
five months said dodger to himself in a tone of dismay
the captain laughed
it'll be a grand experience for a lad like you arthur
said the captain encouragingly
arthur
so his name was arthur
he had just been called master grant so arthur grant was his name on board ship
dodger was rather glad to have a name provided for he had only been known as dodger heretofore and this name would excite surprise
he had recently felt the need of a name and didn't see why this wouldn't answer his purpose as well as any other
i must write it down so as not to forget it he resolved
it would seem queer if i forgot my own name
i shouldn't enjoy it much if i were going to be seasick all the time he answered
oh a strong healthy boy like you will soon be all right
you don't look like an invalid
i never was sick in my life
but your guardian told me he was sending you on a sea voyage for your health
did mr waring say that
yes didn't you know the object of your sea trip
asked capt
barnes in surprise
no
there may be some tendency to disease in your system some hereditary tendency said the captain after a pause
were your parents healthy
they died young answered dodger hesitatingly
that accounts for your guardian's anxiety
however you look strong enough in all conscience and if you're not healthy you will be before the voyage ends
i don't know what i am to do for clothes said dodger as a new source of perplexity presented itself
i can't get along with one shirt and collar for five months
you will find plenty of clothes in your valise
hasn't it been given you
no sir
you may ask the steward for it
you didn't think your guardian would send you on a five months' voyage without a change of clothing did you
and the captain laughed heartily
i don't know mr waring very well said dodger awkwardly
as he went downstairs to inquire about his valise this question haunted him why did curtis waring send him on a sea voyage
chapter xxii
the other passenger
dodger sought the steward and asked for his valise
isn't it in your stateroom
asked that functionary
i haven't seen it
i remember now
it was put with the luggage of the other passenger
i will show it to you
he took dodger to a part of the ship where freight was stored and pointed to a sizable valise with a card attached to it on which was inscribed the name arthur grant
this must be yours he said
yes i suppose so answered dodger glad to have found out the new name which had been given him otherwise he would have supposed the valise belonged to some other person
he took the valise to his stateroom and finding a key tied to the handles he opened it at once
it proved to contain a very fair supply of underclothing socks handkerchiefs etc with a tooth brush a hair brush and comb and a sponge
never in his life had dodger been so well supplied with clothing before
there were four white shirts two tennis shirts half a dozen handkerchiefs and the same number of socks with three changes of underclothing
i begin to feel like a gentleman said dodger to himself complacently
that was not all
at the bottom of the valise was an envelope sealed on which was inscribed the name dodger
that is for me at any rate thought our hero
i suppose it is from curtis waring
he opened the envelope and found inclosed twenty five dollars in bills with a few lines written on a half sheet of paper
these dodger read with interest and curiosity
they were as follows dodger read the letter over twice and it puzzled him
he seems from the letter to take an interest in me he soliloquized
at any rate he has given me money and clothes and paid my passage to california
what for i wonder
i don't believe it is to get me away from the bad influence of tim
there must be some other reason
there was another part of the letter with which dodger did not agree
curtis asserted positively that he was the nephew of tim bolton while he was positive that there was no relationship between them
in that case curtis must have been an early acquaintance of tim's
at any rate he seemed to know about his past life
dodger now comprehended his present situation fully
he was a passenger on the ship columbia and there was no chance of leaving it
he had ascertainel on inquiry that the vessel would not put in anywhere but would make the long voyage direct
it would be over four months at any rate before he could communicate with florence and in the meantime she and mrs o'keefe whom he recognized as a good friend would conclude that he was dead
it was very provoking to think that he could not even telegraph as that would relieve all anxiety and he felt sure that florence was enough his friend to feel anxious about him
he had just closed up his valise when a young man of dark complexion and of an attractive intellectual expression entered the cabin
he nodded pleasantly to dodger and said i suppose this is arthur grant
yes sir answered dodger for he had decided to adopt the name
we ought to become close friends for we are i believe the only passengers
then you are a passenger too
said dodger deciding after a brief scrutiny that he should like his new acquaintance
yes
my name is randolph leslie
i have been for the last five years a reporter on leading new york daily papers and worked so closely that my health has become somewhat affected
my doctor recommended a sea voyage and i have arranged for a pretty long one
what papers have you worked for
oh all the leading ones tribune world herald and sun sometimes one and sometimes another
your reason for taking this trip can hardly be the same as mine
you don't look as if your health required you to travel
no answered dodger smiling but i understand that the gentleman who engaged my passage said i was going to sea for my health
if i were as robust as you i shouldn't give much thought to my health
do you intend to remain in california
i don't know what i do intend replied dodger
i didn't know i was going to california at all until i woke up in my stateroom
the young man looked surprised
didn't you know the destination of the vessel when you came on board
he asked
i was brought aboard in my sleep
this is curious
it looks to me as if you had a story to tell
of course i don't want to be curious but if there is anyway in which i can help you by advice or in any other way i am quite ready to do so
dodger paused but only briefly
this young man looked friendly and might help him to penetrate the mystery which at present baffled him
at any rate his experience qualified him to give friendly advice and of this dodger felt that he stood in need
i ought to tell you to begin with he said that i am a poor boy and made my living as best i could by carrying baggage selling papers etc
i don't think any the worse of you for that
did you live at the lodging houses
no until lately i lived with a man who keeps a saloon on the bowery and tended bar for him
what was his name
as a reporter i know the bowery pretty well
tim bolton
tim bolton
i know his place well
i think i must have seen you there
your face looked familiar to me as soon as i set eyes on you
very likely
a good many people came into tim's
i couldn't pretend to remember them all
was tim a relative of yours
i don't believe he was
i always thought that he got hold of me when i was a kid
i don't remember the time when i wasn't with him
i suppose you have always lived in new york
no i lived for several years in australia
tim was in the same business there
i came on with him a year or more since
do you think you ever lived in new york before
yes tim has told me that i was born in new york
i understand that you have left tim now
yes
why may i ask
because i didn't like the business he was in
but i liked it better than the one he wanted me to go into
what was that
burglary
the young reporter started in surprise
well he said this is a new tack for tim
however i never looked upon him as a man who would shrink from any violation of the laws except murder
i don't think he would do that
no tim isn't quite so bad
he isn't the worst man alive though he is a rather hard customer
it was his wanting me to enter a house on madison avenue and open a desk that led to me going on this trip
tell me about it if you don't mind
thus invited dodger told his story to randolph leslie keeping nothing back
he finished by showing him the letter he had found in the valise
chapter xxiii
through the golden gate
well this is certainly a remarkable letter said the reporter as he handed it back to dodger
i am at a loss to understand the interest which this man appears to feel in you
i look upon him as my enemy said dodger
but an enemy doesn't spend so much money upon another as he has
unless he has object in it amended leslie shrewdly
do you know of any connection this man has with you
no i never heard of him until i entered his house and dodger flushed as he thought that his entrance into the mansion on madison avenue had been as a burglar
it seems to me that he knows more about you than you do about him
it also seems to me that he is anxious to get you out of new york the farther the better
but what harm could i do him in new york
asked dodger puzzled
that is the question which i cannot answer
you say he was instrumental in getting his cousin florence out of the house
yes he wanted to marry her
and she would not consent
no i think she hates him
how old is she
seventeen
and he
he looks about thirty five
the difference in years isn't great enough to constitute an obstacle provided she loved him
i am thirty years old
i am sure florence would prefer you to curtis waring
don't flatter me
i am vain enough already
the time may come when i may ask your good offices with miss linden
what i was about to ask was is miss linden also entitled to a share in her uncle's estate
she is just as nearly related to him as mr
waring
then i can understand his wishing to get rid of her
i don't know why he should want to send you to a distance
i suppose there can't be any relationship
is it likely that i a poor street boy should be related to a rich man like mr
linden
it doesn't seem likely i admit said leslie musingly
well i suppose he continued after a pause there is no use in speculating about the matter now
the important point is what are we to do with ourselves during the four or five months we must spend on shipboard
i don't know what i can do said dodger
i can't sell papers and i can't smash baggage
and there appears to be no need of your doing either as you are provided with board and lodging till we reach shore
that seems strange to me for i've always had to hustle for a living
i was about to make a proposal to you
but first let me ask you about your education
i suppose you are not an accomplished scholar
i'm about as ignorant as they make 'em answered dodger drolly
tim was afraid to send me to college for fear i'd get to know too much for my business
tending bar does not require an acquaintance with latin and greek
would you like to know more
i wish i did
florence was teaching me nights when i was in new york
now i've got to give up all that
not necessarily
listen to me arthur
before i came to new york to go into journalism i taught school for two years and i believe i may say that i was tolerably successful
suppose i take you as a scholar
i should like it very much mr leslie but i'm afraid i haven't got money enough to pay you
that is true
you will need all the money you have when you land in california
twenty five dollars won't go far still you have all the money that is necessary for i do not intend to charge you anything
you are very kind to me mr leslie considerin' you don't know me said dodger gratefully
on the contrary i think i know you very well
but about the kindness my motives are somewhat mixed
i should like to do you a service but i should also like to find employment for myself that will make the days less monotonous
i have a collection of books in my trunk enough for our needs and if you will agree we will commence our studies to morrow
i should like it very much
i'd like to show florence when i see her that i have improved
till i saw her i didn't care much but when i talk with her i feel awfully ignorant
in four months a great deal can be accomplished
i don't know how quick you are to learn
after we have had one or two lessons i can judge better
two days later mr leslie pronounced his opinion and a favorable one
you have not exaggerated your ignorance he said to dodger
you have a great deal to learn but on the other hand you are quick have a retentive memory and are very anxious to learn
i shall make something of you
i learn faster with you than with florence said dodger
probably she would succeed better with girls but i hold that a male teacher is better for boys
how long are you willing to study every day
as long as you think best
then we will say from two to three hours
i think you have talent for arithmetic
i don't expect to make you fit for a bookkeeper but i hope to make you equal to most office boys by the time we reach san francisco
what do you intend to do in california
i don't know
i should like to go back to new york but i shall not have money enough
no twenty five dollars would go but a little way toward the passage
evidently mr waring did not intend to have you return or he would have provided you with more
that is just why i should like to go back
i am afraid he will do some harm to florence
and you would like to be on hand to protect her
yes
randolph leslie smiled
you seem to take a great deal of interest in florence if i may make as free with her name as you do
yes i do mr
leslie
if you were only a little older i might suspect the nature of that interest
i am older than she is
in years yes
but a young lady of seventeen brought up as she has been is older by years than a boy of eighteen
i don't think you need apprehend any harm to miss linden except that mr waring may cheat her out of her rightful share of the inheritance
is her uncle in good health
no sir he is a very feeble man
is he an old man
not so very old
i don't believe he is over sixty
really mr linden was but fifty four but being a confirmed invalid he looked older
should you say that he was likely to live very long
no answered dodger
he looks as if you could knock him over with a feather
besides i've heard florence say that she was afraid her uncle could not live long
probably curtis waring is counting upon this
if he can keep florence and her uncle apart for a few months mr linden will die and he will inherit the whole estate
what is this will he speaks of in the letter you showed me
i don't know sir
whatever the provisions are it is evident that he thinks it important to get it into his possession
if favorable to him he will keep it carefully
if unfavorable i think a man like him would not hesitate to suppress it
no doubt you are right sir
i don't know much about wills said dodger
no i suppose not
you never made any i suppose remarked the reporter with a smile
i never had nothing to leave said dodger
anything would be a better expression
as your tutor i feel it incumbent upon me to correct your grammar
i wish you would mr leslie
what do you mean to do when you get to san francisco
i shall seek employment on one of the san farncisco daily papers
six months or a year so spent will restore my health and enable me to live without drawing upon my moderate savings
i expect i shall have to work too to get money to take me back to new york
and now we must ask the reader to imagine four months and one week passed
there had been favorable weather on the whole and the voyage was unusually short
dodger and the reporter stood on deck and with eager interest watched the passage through the golden gate
a little later and the queen city of the pacific came in sight crowning the hill on which a part of the city is built with the vast palace hotel a conspicuous object in the foreground
chapter xxiv
florence in suspense
we must now return to new york to dodger's old home
when he did not return at the usual hour neither florence nor mrs o'keefe was particularly disturbed
it was thought that he had gone on some errand of unusual length and would return an hour or two late
eight o'clock came the hour at which the boy was accustomed to repair to florence's room to study and still he didn't make his appearance
dodger's late this evening mrs o'keefe said florence going up to the room of her landlady
shure he is
it's likely he's gone to brooklyn or up to harlem wid a bundle
he'll be comin' in soon
i hope he will be well paid for the errand since it keeps him so long
i hope so too florence for he's a good boy is dodger
did i tell you how he served the rapscallion that tried to stale my apples the other day
no i would like to hear it
a big black bearded man came along and asked me for an apple
'you can have one for two pennies' says i
'but i haven't got them' says he
'then you must go widout it' says i
'we'll see about that' says he
and what do you think the fellow picked out one of my biggest apples and was walkin' away
that made me mad
'come back you thafe of the worruld'
says i
'silence you old hag'
says he
actilly he called me an old hag
i wanted to go after him but there was two hoodlums hangin' round and i knew they'd carry off some of my apples when just as i was at my wits' end dodger came round the corner
'dodger' i screamed 'go after that man
he's taken one of my apples widout lave or license'
upon that dodger brave as a lion walked up to the man and says he 'give back that apple or pay for it'
'what's that to you you impudent young rascal'
says the man raisin' the apple to his mouth
but he didn't get a chance to bite it for dodger with a flip of his hand knocked it on the sidewalk and picked it up
wasn't the man mad just
'i'll smash you boy' he growled
'i'm a baggage smasher myself' says dodger 'and i can smash as well as you'
wid that the man up with his fist and struck at dodger but he dodged the blow and gave him one for himself wid his right
just then up came a cop
'what's all this'
says he
'that man tried to run off wid one of my apples' says i
'come along' says the cop
'you're wanted at the station house'
'it's a lie' says the man
'i paid the woman for the apple and that young rascal knocked it out of my hand'
'i know the boy' says the cop 'and he ain't one of that kind
i'll let you go if you buy five apples from the lady and pay for 'em'
the man made up an ugly face but he didn't want to be locked up and so he paid me a dime for five apples
dodger is very brave said florence
sometimes i think he is too daring
he is liable to get into trouble
if he does he'll get himself out of it never you fear
dodger can take care of himself
nine o'clock came and florence became alarmed
she had not been aware how much she had depended upon the company of her faithful friend humble as his station was
again she went into mrs o'keefe's room
the apple woman had been out to buy some groceries and had just returned
i am getting anxious about dodger said florence
it is nine o'clock
and what's nine o'clock for a boy like him
shure he's used to bein' out at all hours of the night
i shall feel relieved when he comes home
what should i do without him
shure i'd miss him myself but it isn't the first time he has been out late
perhaps that terrible tim bolton has got hold of him suggested florence
tim isn't so bad florence
he isn't fit company for the likes of you but there's worse men nor tim
didn't he send out dodger to commit a burglary
and if he hadn't you'd never made dodger's acquaintance
that's true but it doesn't make burglary any more excusable
don't you really think tim bolton has got hold of him
if he has he won't keep him long i'll make oath of that
he might keep him over night but dodger would come back in the morning
florence was somewhat cheered by mrs o'keefe's refusal to believe that dodger was in any serious trouble but she could not wholly free herself from uneasiness
when eleven o'clock came she went to bed very unwillingly and got very little rest during the night
morning came and still dodger did not show up
as we know he was fairly started on his long voyage though he had not yet recovered consciousness
florence took a very light breakfast and at the usual time went to mrs leighton's to meet her pupil
when the study hour was over she did not remain to lunch but hurried back stopping at mrs o'keefe's apple stand just as that lady was preparing to go home to prepare dinner
have you seen anything of dodger mrs
o'keefe
asked florence breathlessly
no i haven't florence
i've had my eye out watchin' for him and he hasn't showed up
is there anything we can do
asked florence anxiously
well we might go around and see tim and find out whether he's got hold of him
let us go at once
shure i didn't know you cared so much for the boy said mrs o'keefe with a shrewd look at florence's anxious face
why shouldn't i care for him
he is my only friend
is he now
and what's the matter wid bridget o'keefe
asked the apple woman
excuse me mrs o'keefe
i know very well you are my friend and a kind friend too
i should not have forgotten you
it's all right florence
you're flustrated like and that's why you forget me
i have so few friends that i can't spare one continued florence
that's so
come along wid me and we'll see what tim has to tell us
a short walk brought the two strangely assorted companions to the entrance of tim bolton's saloon
i'm afraid to go in mrs o'keefe said florence
come along wid me my dear i won't let anything harm you
you ain't used to such a place but i've been here more than once to fill the growler
be careful as you go down the steps florence
tim bolton was standing behind the bar and as he heard steps he looked carelessly toward the entrance but when he saw florence his indifference vanished
he came from behind the bar and advanced to meet her
miss linden he said
florence shrank back and clung to her companion's arm
is there anything i can do for you
i am a rough man but i'm not so bad as you may think
that's what i told her tim said mrs o'keefe
i told florence there was worse men than you
thank you mrs o'keefe
can i offer you a glass of whiskey
the apple woman was about to accept but she felt an alarmed tug at her arm and saw that florence would be placed in an embarrassing position if she accepted
so by an exercise of self denial for mrs o'keefe was by no means insensible to the attractions of whiskey though she never drank to excess she said thank you kindly mr bolton
i won't take any just now but i'll remind you of your offer another day
have it your own way mrs o'keefe
and now what can i do for you and miss linden
oh mr bolton broke in florence unable to bear the suspense longer where is dodger
chapter xxv
finding the clew
tim bolton looked at florence in undisguised astonishment
dodger
he repeated
how should i know
i supposed that you had lured him away from me
he didn't like the business you were in
he preferred to make a living in some other way
then why do you ask me where he is
because he did not come home last night
shure he rooms at my house put in mrs o'keefe and he hasn't showed up since and you thought i might have got hold of him
said bolton inquiringly
then you are mistaken
i haven't seen the boy for weeks
tim bolton spoke so straightforwardly that there was no chance to doubt his word
when he was living with you mr bolton continued florence did he ever stay away like this
no answered bolton
dodger was always very regular about comin' home
then something must have happened to him said florence anxiously
he might have got run in suggested the apple woman
some of them cops is mighty officious
dodger would never do anything to deserve arrest florence said quickly
thrue for you florence but some innersent parties are nabbed
i know of one young man who was standin' on a strate corner waitin' for the cars when a cop came up and arristed him for disorderly conduct
but that is shameful
said florence indignantly
thrue for you my dear
we might go round to the police headquarters and inquire if the boy's been run in
what do you think mr
bolton
asked florence
tim bolton seemed busy thinking
finally he brought down his hand forcibly on the bar and said i begin to see through it
florence did not speak but she fixed an eager look of inquiry on the face of the saloon keeper
i believe curtis waring is at the bottom of this he said
my cousin
exclaimed florence in astonishment
yes your cousin miss linden
but what can he have against poor dodger
is it because the boy has taken my part and is a friend to me
he wouldn't like him any better on account of that but he has another and a more powerful reason
would you mind telling me what it is
i cannot conceive what it can be
at present answered bolton cautiously i prefer to say nothing on the subject
i will only say the boy's disappearance interferes with my plans and i will see if i can't find out what has become of him
if you only will mr bolton i shall be so grateful
i am afraid i have misjudged you
i thought you were an enemy of dodger's
then you were mistaken
i have had the boy with me since he was a kid and though i've been rough with him at times maybe i like him and i may some time have a chance to show him that old tim bolton is one of his best friends
i will believe it now mr bolton said florence impulsively holding out her hand to the burly saloon keeper
he was surprised but it was evident that he was pleased also and he took the little hand respectfully in his own ample palm and pressed it in a friendly manner
there's one thing more i want you to believe miss linden he said and that is that i am your friend also
thank you mr bolton
and now let us all work together to find dodger
you can count on me miss linden
if you'll tell me where you live i'll send or bring you any news i may hear
i live with mrs o'keefe my good friend here
i haven't my kyard with me tim said the apple woman but i'll give you my strate and number
you know my place of business
yes
if you come to me there i'll let florence know whatever you tell me
she is not always at home
the two went away relieved in mind for helpless and bewildered as they were they felt that tim bolton would make a valuable ally
when they had gone tim turned to hooker and briggs who were lounging at a table waiting for some generous customer to invite them to the bar
boys said tim has either of you seen anything of dodger lately
no answered the two in unison
have you heard anything of him
i heard that he was baggage smashin' down by the steamboat landings said hooker
go down there both of you and see if you can see or hear anything of him
all right tim
and the two left the saloon and took a westerly route toward the north river piers
three hours later they returned
have you heard anything
asked bolton
did you see dodger
no we didn't see him
but you heard something
yes we found a boy a friend of his that said the last he saw of dodger was last evenin'
where did he see him
near the pier of the albany boats
what was he doin'
carryin' a valise for a man
what kind of a man
how did he look
he had gray hair and gray whiskers
tim was puzzled by the description
if as he suspected curtis were concerned in the abduction this man could not have been he
the man was a passenger by the albany boat i suppose
no that was what looked queer
before the albany boat came in the man was lyin' round with his valise and the boy thought he was goin' off somewhere
but when the boat came in he just mixed in with the passengers and came up to the entrance of the pier
two boys asked to carry his valise but he shook his head till dodger came round and he engaged him right off
tim bolton nodded knowingly
it was a plan he said
the man wanted to get hold of dodger
what puzzles me is that you said he was an old man
his hair and beard were gray
and curtis has no beard and his hair is black
but the boy said he didn't look like an old man except the hair
he walked off like a young man
tim bolton's face lighted up with sudden intelligence
i'll bet a hat it was curtis in disguise he soliloquized
that's all we could find out mr bolton said briggs with another longing look at the bar
it is enough
you have earned your whiskey
walk up gentlemen
hooker and briggs needed no second invitation
will either of you take a note for me to mrs o'keefe
for another drink of course
i will tim said hooker eagerly
no take me mr bolton entreated briggs
you can both go said tim generously
wait a minute and i'll have it ready for you
he found a half sheet of note paper and scribbled on it this message chapter xxvi
bolton makes a discovery
i see it all bolton said to himself thoughtfully
curtis waring is afraid of the boy and of me
he's circumvented me neatly and the game is his so far my little plan is dished
i must find out for certain whether he's had anything to do with gettin' dodger out of the way and then tim bolton you must set your wits to work to spoil his little game
bolton succeeded in securing the services of a young man who had experience at tending bar and about eight o'clock after donning his best attire he hailed a fourth avenue surface car and got aboard
getting out at the proper street he made his way to madison avenue and ascended the steps of john linden's residence
the door was opened by jane who eyed the visitor with no friendly glance
what do you want
she asked in a hostile tone
is mr waring at home
i don't know
is miss florence at home
do you know her
she asked
yes i am a friend of hers
jane evidently thought that florence must have made some queer friends
have you seen her lately
she asked eagerly
i saw her to day
is she well
yes she is well but she is in trouble
is she does she need any money
no it isn't that
the boy dodger has disappeared and she is afraid something has happened to him
oh i am so sorry
he was a good friend of miss florence
i see you know him
i am trying to help him and her
but you asked for mr
waring
said jane suspiciously
so i did
shall i tell you why
i wish you would
i think he has something to do with gettin' dodger out of the way and i'm goin' to try to find out
he won't tell you
you don't understand
i shall make him think i am on his side
was he at home last night
he went away at dinner time and he didn't come home till after twelve
i ought to know for he forgot his latchkey and i had to get up and let him in
i won't do it again
i'll let him stay out first
i see he was with dodger no doubt
did you say he was in
no sir but he will be in directly
won't you step into the library
shall i meet the old gentleman there
asked bolton in a tone of hesitation
no
he goes up to his chamber directly after dinner
how is he
i think he's failing
i hope there is no immediate danger said bolton anxiously
no but he's worrying about miss florence
it's my belief that if she were at home he'd live a good while
doesn't he ask for her
mr curtis tells him she'll come round soon if he'll only be firm
i don't see for my part why mr linden wants her to marry such a disagreeable man
there's plenty better husbands she could get
come in sir and i'll tell him as soon as he comes in
shall you see miss florence soon
i think so
then tell her not to give up
things will come right some time
i'll tell her
bolton was ushered into the library where amid the fashionable furniture he looked quite out of place
he did not feel so however for he drew a cigar out of his pocket and lighting it nonchalantly leaned back in a luxurious armchair and began to smoke
curtis waring is well fixed that's a fact
he soliloquized
i suppose he is the master here for the old man isn't likely to interfere
still he will like it better when his uncle is out of the way
he had to wait but fifteen minutes in solitude for at the end of that time curtis waring appeared
he paused on the threshold and frowned when he saw who it was that awaited him
jane told me that a gentleman was waiting to see me he said
well she was right
and you i suppose are the gentleman
said curtis in a sneering tone
yes i am the gentleman remarked bolton coolly
i am not in the habit of receiving visits from gentlemen of your class
however i suppose you have an object in calling
it shall go hard with me if i don't pay you for your sneers some day thought bolton but he remained outwardly unruffled
well he answered i can't say that i have any particular business to see you about
i saw your cousin recently
florence
asked curtis eagerly
yes
what did she say
did you speak with her
yes
she doesn't seem any more willin' to marry you
curtis waring frowned
she is a foolish girl he said
she doesn't know her own mind
she looks to me like a gal that knows her own mind particularly well
pshaw
what can you know about it
then you really expect to marry her some time mr
waring
certainly i do
and to inherit your uncle's fortune
of course
why not
i was thinkin' of the boy
the boy is dead what
exclaimed bolton jumping to his feet in irresistible excitement
don't be a fool
wait till i finish my sentence
he is dead so far as his prospects are concerned
who is there that can identify him with the lost child of john linden
i can
yes if any one would believe you
however it is for your interest to keep silent
that is just what i want to know
i suppose you can make it for my interest
yes and will after i get the property
i don't believe in counting my chickens before they are hatched
of course you know that the boy has left me
said bolton
yes answered curtis indifferently
he is with my cousin i believe
yes and through her i can learn where he is and get hold of him if i desire
a cynical smile played over the face of curtis waring
do you propose to get him back
he asked shrugging his shoulders
i am right thought bolton shrewdly
from his manner it is easy to see that curtis is quite at ease as regards dodger
he knows where he is
you asked me what business i came about mr waring he said after a pause
yes
of course i am devoted to your interests but is it quite fair to make me wait till you come into your fortune before allowing me anything
i think so
you don't seem to consider that i can bring the boy here and make him known to your uncle as the son he lost so long ago
you are quite sure you can bring the boy here
asked curtis
why not
i have only to go to florence and ask her to send the boy to me
you are quite at liberty to do so if you like tim bolton said curtis with a mocking smile
i am glad at any rate that you have shown me what is in your mind
you are very sharp but you are not quite so sharp as i am
i don't understand you
then i will be more explicit
it's out of your power to make use of the boy against me because well
because he is not in the city
where is he then
where you are not likely to find him
if you have killed him bolton began but curtis interrupted him
the boy is safe i will tell you that much he said but for reasons which you can guess i think it better that he should be out of new york
when the proper time comes and all is safe he may come back but not in time to help you in your cunning plans mr tim bolton
then i suppose said bolton assuming an air of mortification and discomfiture it is no use for me to remain here any longer
you are quite right
i wish you a pleasant journey home
give my love to florence when you see her
that man is a fiend
soliloquized bolton as he walked back leisurely to his place of business
let me get hold of dodger and i will foil him yet
chapter xxvii
dodger strikes luck
when dodger landed in san francisco in spite of the fact that he had made the journey against his will he felt a natural exhilaration and pleasure in the new and striking circumstances and scenes in which he found himself placed
it was in the year and the city was by no means what it is now
yet it probably contained not far from two hundred thousand people lively earnest enterprising
all seemed busy and hopeful and dodger caught the contagion
as he walked with the reporter to a modest hotel where the rates were a dollar and a half a day not far from montgomery street randolph leslie asked how do you like san francisco thus far arthur
it will be remembered that dodger feeling that the name by which he had hitherto been known was hardly likely to recommend him adopted the one given him by curtis waring
i think i shall like it ever so much answered dodger
everybody seems to be wideawake
do you think you will like it better than new york
i think a poor boy will have more of a chance of making a living here
in new york i was too well known
if i got a place anywhere some one would recognize me as tim bolton's boy accustomed to tend bar or some gentleman would remember that he had bought papers of me
here nobody knows me and i can start fair
there is a great deal in what you say returned leslie
what do you think of trying to do
first of all i will write a letter to florence and tell her i am all right
how long does it take a letter to go from here to new york
about seven days
and it took us over four months
that seems wonderful
yes there is a great difference between coming by sea around cape horn and speeding across the country on an express train
if i could only know how florence is getting along dodger said anxiously
i suppose she thinks i am dead
you forget the letter you gave to the vessel we spoke off the coast of brazil
yes but do you think it went straight
the chances are in favor of it
however your idea is a good one
write by all means and then we will discuss future plans
what are your plans mr
leslie
i shall try to secure a reporter's berth on one of the daily papers the call or chronicle
i will wait a few days however as i have a few hundred dollars by me and can afford to take a little time to look around
i wish i were as well provided but i have less than twenty five dollars
don't worry about that arthur said randolph laying his hand affectionately on the boy's shoulder
i shall not allow you to want
thank you mr leslie said dodger gratefully
it's something new to me to have a friend like you
but i don't want to be any expense to you
i am large enough and strong enough to earn my own living
true and i feel sure you will have a chance in this enterprising city
they bought copies of the day's papers and dodger looked eagerly over the advertising columns
at length he saw an advertisement that read as follows do you think i would answer for such a place
he asked
i don't see why not
at any rate 'nothing venture nothing gain'
you may as well go around and inquire
and by the way as your suit is rather shabby let me lend you one of mine
we are of nearly the same size
thank you mr
leslie
fine feathers make fine birds you know and a neat dress always increases the chances of an applicant for employment though when it is carried too far it is apt to excite suspicion
i remember a friend of mine advertised for a bookkeeper
among the applicants was a young man wearing a sixty dollar suit a ruffled shirt a handsome gold watch and a diamond pin
he was a man of taste and he was strongly impressed with the young man's elegant appearance
so largely upon the strength of these he engaged him and in less than six months discovered that he had been swindled to the extent of eight hundred dollars by his aesthetic bookkeeper
then i will leave my diamond pin at home said dodger smiling
suppose they ask me for recommendations
i will go with you and indorse you
i happen to know one or two prominent gentlemen in san francisco among them the president of a bank and i presume my indorsement will be sufficient
dodger went back to the hotel put on a suit of mr leslie's got his boots blacked and then in company with the young reporter went to the express office
i am afraid some one will have been engaged already said the reporter but if not your chances will be good
they entered a good sized office on a prominent street and dodger inquired for mr tucker
a small man of about forty keen eyed and alert eyed him attentively
i am mr tucker he said
i saw your advertisement for an assistant mr tucker said dodger modestly have you filled the place
let me see said tucker reflectively you are the ninth young man who has applied but the place is still open
then i am afraid you won't want me as you have rejected so many
i don't know
how long have you been in the city
i only just arrived
where from
from new york
have you any idea of going to the mines when you get money enough
i think i would prefer to remain in the city
good
how is your education
i have never been to college answered dodger with a smile
good
i don't care for your college men
i am a practical man myself
i am a poor scholar but mr leslie tells me i write a fair hand
let me see a specimen of your writing
now dodger had taken special pains on the voyage to improve his penmanship with excellent results
so it happened that the specimen which he furnished had the good fortune to please mr tucker
good
he said
you will a part of the time be taking orders
your handwriting is plain and will do
never mind about latin and greek
you won't need it
chinese would be more serviceable to you here
when can you go to work
to morrow morning
to day if necessary answered dodger promptly
mr tucker seemed pleased with his answer
to morrow morning let it be then
hours are from eight in the morning till six at night
very well sir
your wages will be fifteen dollars a week
how will that suit you
dodger wanted to indulge in a loud whoop of exultation for fifteen dollars was beyond his wildest hopes but he was too politic to express his delight
so he contented himself with saying i shall be quite satisfied with that
oh by the way i suppose i ought to have some reference said mr tucker though as a general thing i judge a good deal by outward appearance
i can refer you to my friend mr leslie here
and who will indorse him
asked the expressman shrewdly
leslie smiled
i see mr tucker you are a thorough man of business
i can refer you to mr president of the bank in this city
that is sufficient sir
i am sure you would not refer me to him unless you felt satisfied that he would speak favorably of you
i won't therefore take the trouble to inquire
where are you staying
at the pacific hotel but we shall take a private apartment within a day or two
as they passed out of the office randolph leslie said you've done splendidly arthur
haven't i
i feel like a millionaire
as you are to go to work to morrow we may as well take up a room at once
it will be cheaper
in a short time they had engaged a neat suite of rooms two in number not far from the palace hotel at twenty dollars per month
the next day leslie procured a position on the san francisco chronicle at twenty five dollars per week
chapter xxviii
florence receives a letter
the discovery through tim bolton that curtis waring had a hand in the disappearance of dodger partially relieved the anxiety of florence but only partially
he might be detained in captivity but even that was far better than an accident to life or limb
she knew that he would try to get word to her at the earliest opportunity in order to relieve her fears
but week after week passed and no tidings came
at length at the end of ten weeks a note came to her written on a rough sheet of paper the envelope marked by a foreign stamp
it ran thus florence's face was radiant when she had read the letter
dodger was alive well and in good spirits
the letter arrived during the afternoon and she put on her street dress at once and went over to the apple stand and read the letter to mrs o'keefe
well well
ejaculated the apple woman
so it's that ould thafe of the worruld curtis waring that has got hold of poor dodger just as tim told us
it seems mighty quare to me that he should want to stale poor dodger
if it was you now i could understand it
it seems strange to me mrs o'keefe said florence thoughtfully
i thought it might be because dodger was my friend but that doesn't seem to be sufficient explanation
don't you think we ought to show this letter to mr
bolton
i was going to suggest that same
if you'll give it to me florence i'll get mattie to tend my stand and slip round wid it to tim's right off
i will go with you mrs
o'keefe
mattie who was playing around the corner was summoned
now mattie just mind the stand and don't be runnin' away or them boys will get away wid my whole mornin's profits
do you hear
yes mum
and don't you be eatin' all the while you are here
here's one apple you can have and the apple woman carefully picked out one that she considered unsalable
that's specked mrs o'keefe objected mattie
and what if it is
can't you bite out the specks
the rest of the apple is good
you're gettin' mighty particular
mattie bit a piece out of the sound part of the apple and when mrs o'keefe was at a safe distance gave the rest to a lame bootblack and picked out one of the best apples for her own eating
bridget o'keefe is awful mane wid her apples
soliloquized mattie but i'm too smart for her
tryin' to pass off one of her old specked apples on me
if i don't take three good one i'm a sinner
arrived at the front of the saloon mrs o'keefe penetrated the interior and met tim near the door
have you come in for some whiskey old lady
asked tim in a jesting tone
i'll take that by and by
florence is outside and we've got some news for you
won't she come in
no she don't like to be seen in a place like this
she's got a letter from dodger
you don't mean it
ejaculated tim with sudden interest
where is he
come out and see
good afternoon miss linden said tim gallantly
so you've news from dodger
yes here is the letter
bolton read it through attentively
curtis is smart he said as he handed it back
he couldn't have thought of a better plan for getting rid of the boy
it will take several months for him to reach 'frisco and after that he can't get back for he won't have any money
dodger says he will try to save money enough to pay his way back
it will take him a good while
it doesn't take long to come back by cars does it
no but it costs a great deal of money
why it may take dodger a year to earn enough to pay his way back on the railroad
a year
exclaimed florence in genuine dismay a year in addition to the time it takes to go out there
where will we all be at the end of that time
not in jail i hope answered bolton jocularly
i am afraid your uncle will no longer be in the land of the living
a shadow came over florence's face
poor uncle john
she said sadly
it is terrible to think he may die thinking hardly of me
leavin' his whole fortune to curtis continued tim
that is the least thing that troubles me said florence
a woman's a queer thing said tim shrugging his shoulders
here's a fortune of maybe half a million and half of it rightfully yours and you don't give it a thought
not compared with the loss of my uncle's affections
money is a great deal more practical than affection
perhaps so from your standpoint mr bolton said florence with dignity
no offense miss
when you've lived as long as i you'll look at things different
well i'm glad to hear from the lad
if curtis had done him any harm i'd have got even with him if it sent me to jail
a quiet determined look replaced tim bolton's usual expression of easy good humor
he could not have said anything that would have ingratiated him more with florence
thank you mr bolton she said earnestly
i shall always count upon your help
i believe you are a true friend of dodger and of yours too miss i believe it she said with a smile that quite captivated tim
if it would be any satisfaction to you miss florence he continued i'll give curtis waring a lickin'
he deserves it for persecutin' you and gettin' you turned out of your uncle's house
thank you mr bolton it wouldn't be any satisfaction to me to see curtis injured in any way
you're too good a christian you are miss florence
i wish i deserved your praise but i can hardly lay claim to it
now mr bolton tell me what can i do to help dodger
i don't see that you can do anything now as it will be most three months before he reaches 'frisco
you might write to him toward the time he gets there
i will
direct to the post office
i think he'll have sense enough to ask for letters
i wish i could send him some money
i am afraid he will land penniless
if he lands in good health you can trust him for makin' a livin'
a new york boy brought up as he was isn't goin' to starve where there are papers to sell and errands to run
why he'll light on his feet in 'frisco take my word for it
florence felt a good deal encouraged by tim's words of assurance and she went home with her heart perceptibly lightened
but she was soon to have trials of her own which for the time being would make her forgetful of dodger
chapter xxix
mrs leighton's party
miss linden said mrs leighton one day in the fourth month of dodger's absence carrie has perhaps told you that i give a party next thursday evening
she told me answered the governess
i expected prof bouvier to furnish dancing music in fact i had engaged him but i have just received a note stating that he is unwell and i am left unprovided
it is very inconsiderate on his part added the lady in a tone of annoyance
florence did not reply
she took rather a different view of the professor's letter and did not care to offend mrs leighton
under the circumstances continued the lady it has occurred to me that as you are really quite a nice performer you might fill his place
i shall be willing to allow you a dollar for the evening
what do you say
florence felt embarrassed
she shrank from appearing in society in her present separation from her family yet could think of no good excuse
noticing her hesitation mrs leighton added patronizingly on second thought i will pay you a dollar and a half prof bouvier was to have charged ten dollars and you will be kind enough to come in your best attire
you seem to be well provided with dresses
yes madam there will be no difficulty on that score
nor on any other i hope
as governess in my family i think i have a right to command your services
i will come said florence meekly
she felt that it would not do to refuse after this
as she entered the handsomely decorated rooms on the night of the party she looked around her nervously fearing to see some one whom she had known in earlier days
she noticed one only percy de brabazon whose face lighted up when he saw her for he had been expecting to see her
she managed to convey a caution by a quiet movement as it would not be wise for mrs leighton to know of their previous acquaintance
but percy was determined to get an opportunity to speak to her
who is that young lady aunt mary
he asked
the one standing near the piano
that is carrie's governess answered mrs leighton carelessly
she seems quite a ladylike person
yes
i understand she has seen better days
she is to play for us in the absence of prof
bouvier
will you introduce me aunt
why
asked mrs leighton with a searching look
i should like to inquire about carrie's progress in her studies said the cunning percy
oh certainly answered the aunt quite deceived by his words
miss linden she said let me introduce my nephew mr de brabazon
he wishes to inquire about carrie's progress in her studies
and the lady sailed off to another part of the room
i can assure you mr de brabazon said florence that my young charge is making excellent progress
i can easily believe it under your instruction said percy
i am very glad you take such an interest in your cousin added florence with a smile
it does you great credit
it's only an excuse you know to get a chance to talk with you miss linden
may i say miss florence
no answered florence decidedly
it won't do
you must be very formal
then tell me how you like teaching
very well indeed
it must be an awful bore i think
i don't think so
carrie is a warm hearted affectionate girl
besides she is very bright and gives me very little trouble
don't you think you could take another pupil miss linden
a young girl
no a young man
in fact myself
what could i teach you mr de brabazon
lots of things
i am not very sound in in spelling and grammar
what a pity
answered florence with mock seriousness
i am afraid your aunt would hardly consent to have a boy of your size in the schoolroom
then perhaps you could give me some private lessons in the afternoon
that would not be possible
just then mrs leighton came up
well she said what does miss linden say of carrie
she has quite satisfied my mind about her answered percy with excusable duplicity
i think her methods are excellent
i was telling her that i might be able to procure her another pupil
i have no objection as long as it does not interfere with carrie's hours
miss linden there is a call for music
will you go to the piano and play a stauss waltz
florence inclined her head obediently
let me escort you to the piano miss linden said percy
thank you answered florence in a formal tone
for an hour florence was engaged in playing waltzes gallops and lanciers music
then a lady who was proud of her daughter's proficiency volunteered her services to relieve florence
now you can dance yourself said percy in a low tone
will you give me a waltz
not at once
wait till the second dance
percy de brabazon was prompt in presenting himself as soon as permitted and he led florence out for a dance
both were excellent dancers and attracted general attention
florence really enjoyed dancing and forgot for a time that she was only a guest on sufferance as she moved with rhythmic grace about the handsome rooms
percy was disposed to prolong the dance but florence was cautious
i think i will rest now mr de brabazon she said
you will favor me again later in the evening
he pleaded
i hardly think it will be wise
but when half an hour later he asked her again florence could not find it in her heart to say no
it would have been wise if she had done so
a pair of jealous eyes was fixed upon her
miss emily carter had for a considerable time tried to fascinate mr de brabazon whose wealth made him a very desirable match and she viewed his decided penchant for florence with alarm and indignation
to be thrown in the shade by a governess is really too humiliating
she murmured to herself in vexation
if it were a girl in my own station i should not care so much and she eyed florence with marked hostility
mamma she said do you see how mr de barbazon is carrying on with mrs leighton's governess
really i think it very discreditable
mrs carter looked through her gold eye glasses at the couple
is the girl really a governess
she added
she is very well dressed
i don't know where she got her dress but she is really a governess
she seems very bold
so she does
poor florence
she was far from deserving their unkindly remarks
i suppose she is trying to ensnare young de brabazon said emily spitefully
people of her class are very artful
don't you think it would be well to call mrs leighton's attention
percy de brabazon is her nephew you know
true
the suggestion is a good one emily
mrs carter was quite as desirous as her daughter of bringing about an alliance with percy and she readily agreed to second her plans
she looked about for mrs leighton and took a seat at her side
your nephew seems quite attentive to your governess she commenced
indeed
in what way
he has danced with her three or four times i believe
it looks rather marked
so it does said mrs leighton
he is quite inconsiderate
oh well it is of no great consequence
she is quite stylish for a governess and doubtless your nephew is taken with her
that will not suit my views at all said mrs leighton coldly
i shall speak to her to morrow
pray don't
it really is a matter of small consequence quite natural in fact
leave the matter with me
you have done quite right in mentioning it
at twelve o'clock the next day when florence had just completed her lessons with carrie mrs leighton entered the room
please remain a moment miss linden she said
i have a few words to say to you
mrs leighton's tone was cold and unfriendly and florence felt that something unpleasant was coming
chapter xxx
florence is followed home
i am listening madam said florence inclining her head
i wish to speak to you about last evening miss linden
i hope my playing was satisfactory mrs leighton
i did my best
i have no fault to find with your music
it came up to my expectations
i am glad of that madam
i referred rather to your behavior miss linden
i don't understand you mrs leighton florence responded in unaffected surprise
please explain
you danced several times with my nephew mr percy de brabazon
twice madam
i understood it was oftener
however that is immaterial
you hardly seemed conscious of your position
what was my position mrs
leighton
asked florence quietly looking her employer in the face
well ahem
answered mrs leighton a little ill at ease you were a hired musician
well
and you acted as if you were an invited guest
i am sorry you did not give me instructions as to my conduct said the governess coldly
i should not have danced if i had been aware that it was prohibited
i am sorry miss linden that you persist in misunderstanding me
mr de brabazon being in a different social position from yourself it looked hardly proper that he should have devoted himself to you more than to any other lady
did he
i was not aware of it
don't you think under the circumstances that he is the one whom you should take to task
i didn't invite his attentions
you seemed glad to receive them
i was
he is undoubtedly a gentleman
certainly he is
he is my nephew
it was not my part to instruct him as to what was proper surely
you are very plausible
miss linden i think it right to tell you that your conduct was commented upon by one of my lady guests as unbecoming
however i will remember in extenuation that you are unaccustomed to society and doubtless erred ignorantly
florence bowed but forbore to make any remark
do you wish to speak further to me mrs
leighton
no i think not
then i will bid you good morning
when the governess had left the house mrs leighton asked herself whether in her encounter with her governess the victory rested with her and she was forced to acknowledge that it was at least a matter of doubt
miss linden is a faithful teacher but she does not appear to appreciate the difference that exists between her and my guests
i think however that upon reflection she will see that i am right in my stricture upon her conduct
florence left the house indignant and mortified
it was something new to her to be regarded as a social inferior and she felt sure that there were many in mrs leighton's position who would have seen no harm in her behavior on the previous evening
four days afterward when florence entered the madison avenue car to ride downtown she had scarcely reached her seat when an eager voice addressed her miss linden how fortunate i am in meeting you
florence looked up and saw mr de brabazon sitting nearly opposite her
though she felt an esteem for him she was sorry to see him for with mrs leighton's rebuke fresh in her mind it could only be a source of embarrassment and if discovered subject her in all probability to a fresh reprimand
you are kind to say so mr de brabazon
not at all
i hoped i might meet you again soon
what a pleasant time we had at the party
i thought so at the time but the next day i changed my mind
why may i ask
because your aunt mrs leighton took me to task for dancing with you twice
was she so absurd
ejaculated percy
it is not necessarily absurd
she said our social positions were so different that it was unbecoming for me to receive attention from you
rubbish
exclaimed percy warmly
i am afraid i ought not to listen to such strictures upon the words of my employer
i wish you didn't have to teach
i can't join you in that wish
i enjoy my work
but you ought to be relieved from the necessity
we must accept things as we find them said florence gravely
there is a way out of it said percy quickly
you understand me do you not
i think i do mr de brabazon and i am grateful to you but i am afraid it can never be
percy remained silent
how far are you going
asked florence uneasily for she did not care to have her companion learn where she lived
i intend to get out at fourteenth street
then i must bid you good afternoon for we are already at fifteenth street
if i can be of any service to you i will ride farther
thank you said florence hastily but it is quite unnecessary
then good morning
and percy descended from the car
in another part of the car sat a young lady who listened with sensations far from pleasant to the conversation that had taken place between florence and mr de brabazon
it was emily carter whose jealousy had been excited on the evening of the party
she dropped her veil fearing to be recognized by mr de brabazon with whom she was well acquainted
she too had intended getting off at fourteenth street but decided to remain longer in the car
i will find out where that girl lives she resolved
her conduct with percy de brabazon is positively disgraceful
she is evidently doing her best to captivate him
i feel that it is due to mrs leighton who would be shocked at the thought of her nephew's making a low alliance to find out all i can and put her on her guard
she kept her seat still keeping her veil down for it was possible that florence might recognize her and the car moved steadily onward till it turned into the bowery
where on earth is she leading me
miss carter asked herself
i have never been in this neighborhood before
however it won't do to give up when i am perhaps on the verge of some important discoveries
still the car sped on
not far from grand street florence left the car followed though she was unconscious of it by her aristocratic fellow passenger
florence stopped a moment to speak to mrs o'keefe at her apple stand
so you're through wid your work florence
are you goin' home
yes mrs
o'keefe
then i'll go wid you for i've got a nasty headache and i'll lie down for an hour
they crossed the street not noticing the veiled young lady who followed within ear shot and listened to their conversation
at length they reached the tenement house florence's humble home and went in
i've learned more than i bargained for said emily carter in malicious exultation
i am well repaid for coming to this horrid part of the city
i wonder if mr de brabazon knows where his charmer lives
i will see that mrs leighton knows at any rate
chapter xxxi
florence is discharged
mrs leighton sat in her boudoir with a stern face and tightly compressed lips
miss carter had called the previous afternoon and informed her of the astounding discoveries she had made respecting the governess
she rang the bell
janet she said when the governess comes you may bring her up here to me
yes ma'am
she's going to catch it i wonder what for
thought janet as she noted the grim visage of her employer
so when florence entered the house she was told that mrs leighton wished to see her at once
i wonder what's the matter now
she asked herself
has she heard of my meeting her nephew in the car
when she entered the room she saw at once that something was wrong
you wished to see me mrs
leighton
she said
yes answered mrs leighton grimly
will you be seated
florence sat down a few feet from her employer and waited for an explanation
she certainly was not prepared for mrs leighton's first words miss linden where do you live
florence started and her face flushed
i live in the lower part of the city she answered with hesitation
that is not sufficiently definite
i live at no
street
i think that is east of the bowery
you are right madam
you lodge with an apple woman do you not
i do answered florence calmly
in a tenement house
yes madam
and you actually come from such a squalid home to instruct my daughter
exclaimed mrs leighton indignantly
it is a wonder you have not brought some terrible disease into the house
there has been no case of disease in the humble dwelling in which i make my home
i should be as sorry to expose your daughter to any danger of that kind as you would be to have me
it is a merciful dispensation of providence for which i ought to be truly thankful
but the idea of receiving in my house an inmate of a tenement house
i am truly shocked
is this apple woman your mother
i assure you that she is not answered florence with a smile which she could not repress
or your aunt
she is in no way related to me
she is an humble friend
miss linden your tastes must be low to select such a home and such a friend
the state of my purse had something to do with the selection and the kindness shown me by mrs o'keefe when i needed a friend will explain my location further
that is not all
you met in the madison avenue car yesterday my nephew mr percy de brabazon
it is coming thought florence
who could have seen us
then aloud yes madam
was it by appointment
do you mean to insult me mrs
leighton
demanded florence rising and looking at the lady with flashing eyes
i never insult anybody replied mrs leighton
pray resume your seat
florence did so
then i may assume that it was accidental
you talked together with the freedom of old friends
you are correctly informed
you seem to make acquaintances very readily miss linden
it seems singular to say the least that after meeting my nephew for a single evening you should become such intimate friends
you will be surprised mrs leighton when i say that mr de brabazon and i are old friends
we have met frequently
where in heaven's name
ejaculated mrs leighton
at my residence
good heavens
exclaimed the scandalized lady
does my nephew percy visit at the house of this apple woman
no madam
he does not know where i live
then you will explain your previous statement
said mrs leighton haughtily
i am at present suffering reversed circumstances
it is but a short time since i was very differently situated
i won't inquire into your change of circumstances
i feel compelled to perform an unpleasant duty
florence did not feel called upon to make any reply but waited for mrs leighton to finish speaking
i shall be obliged to dispense with your services as my daughter's governess
it is quite out of the question for me to employ a person who lives in a tenement house
florence bowed acquiescence but she felt very sad
she had become attached to her young charge and it cost her a pang to part from her
besides how was she to supply the income of which this would deprive her
i bow to your decision madam she said with proud humility
you will find here the sum that i owe you with payment for an extra week in lieu of notice
thank you
may i bid carrie good by mrs
leighton
it is better not to do so i think
the more quietly we dissolve our unfortunate connection the better
florence's heart swelled and the tears came to her eyes but she could not press her request
she was destined however to obtain the privilege which mrs leighton denied her
carrie who had become impatient came downstairs and burst into the room
what keeps you so long miss linden
she said
is mamma keeping you
florence was silent leaving the explanations to mrs leighton
miss linden has resigned her position as your governess carrie
miss linden going away
i won't have her go
what makes you go miss linden
your mamma thinks it best answered florence with moistened eyes
well i don't
exclaimed carrie stamping her foot angrily
i won't have any other governess but you
carrie you are behaving very unbecomingly said her mother
will you tell me mamma why you are sending miss linden away
i will tell you some other time
but i want to know now
i am very much displeased with you carrie
and i am very much displeased with you mamma
i do not pretend to defend carrie whose conduct was hardly respectful enough to her mother but with all her faults she had a warm heart while her mother had always been cold and selfish
i am getting tired of this said mrs leighton
miss linden as you are here to day you may give carrie the usual lessons
as i shall be out when you get through i bid you good by now
good by mrs
leighton
carrie and florence went to the schoolroom for the last time
florence gave her young pupil a partial explanation of the cause which had led to her discharge
what do i care if you live in a poor house miss linden
said carrie impetuously
i will make mamma take you back
florence smiled but she knew that there would be no return for her
when she reached her humble home she had a severe headache and lay down
mrs o'keefe came in later to see her
and what's the matter with you florence
she asked
i have a bad headache mrs
o'keefe
you work too hard florence wid your teacher
that is what gives you the headache
then i shan't have it again for i have got through with my teaching
what's that you say
i am discharged
and what's it all about
florence explained matters
mrs o'keefe became indignant
she's a mean trollop that mrs
leighton
she exclaimed and i'd like to tell her so to her face
where does she live
it will do no good to interfere my good friend
she is not willing to receive a governess from a tenement house
shure you used to live in as grand a house as herself
but i don't now
don't mind it too much mavoureen
you'll soon be gettin' another scholar
go to sleep now and you'll sleep the headache away
florence finally succeeded in following the advice of her humble friend
she resolved to leave till the morrow the cares of the morrow
she had twelve dollars and before that was spent she hoped to be in a position to earn some more
chapter xxxii
an exciting adventure
dodger soon became accustomed to his duties at tucker's express office in his new san francisco home
he found mr tucker an exacting but not an unreasonable man
he watched his new assistant closely for the first few days and was quietly taking his measure
at the end of the first week he paid the salary agreed upon fifteen dollars
you have been with me a week arthur he said
yes sir
and i have been making up my mind about you
yes sir said dodger looking up inquiringly
i hope you are satisfied with me
yes i think i may say that i am
you don't seem to be afraid of work
i have always been accustomed to work
that is well
i was once induced to take the son of a rich man in the place you now occupy
he had never done a stroke of work having always been at school
he didn't take kindly to work and seemed afraid that he would be called upon to do more than he had bargained for
one evening i was particularly busy and asked him to remain an hour overtime
'it will be very inconvenient mr tucker' said the young man 'as i have an engagement with a friend'
he left me to do all the extra work and i suppose you know what happened the next saturday evening
i can guess returned dodger with a smile
i told him that i thought the duties were too heavy for his constitution and he had better seek an easier place
let me see i kept you an hour and a half overtime last wednesday
yes sir
you made no objection but worked on just as if you liked it
yes sir i am always willing to stay when you need me
good
i shan't forget it
dodger felt proud of his success and put away the fifteen dollars with a feeling of satisfaction
he had never saved half that sum in the same time before
curtis waring did me a favor when he sent me out here he reflected but as he didn't mean it i have no occasion to feel grateful
dodger found that he could live for eight dollars a week and he began to lay by seven dollars a week with the view of securing funds sufficient to take him back to new york
he was in no hurry to leave san francisco but he felt that florence might need a friend
but he found that he was making progress slowly
at that time the price of a first class ticket to new york was one hundred and twenty eight dollars besides the expense of sleeping berths amounting then as now to twenty two dollars extra
so it looked as if dodger would be compelled to wait at least six months before he should be in a position to set out on the return journey
about this time dodger received a letter from florence in which she spoke of her discharge by mrs leighton
i shall try to obtain another position as teacher she said concealing her anxiety
i am sure in a large city i can find something to do
but dodger knew better than she the difficulties that beset the path of an applicant for work and he could not help feeling anxious for florence
if i were only in new york he said to himself i would see that florence didn't suffer
i will write her to let me know if she is in need and i will send her some money
about this time he met with an adventure which deserves to be noted
it was about seven o'clock one evening that he found himself in mission street
at a street corner his attention was drawn to a woman poorly dressed who held by the hand a child of three
her clothing was shabby and her attitude was one of despondency
it was clear that she was ill and in trouble
dodger possessed quick sympathies and his own experience made him quick to understand and feel for the troubles of others
though the woman made no appeal he felt instinctively that she needed help
i beg your pardon he said with as much deference as if he were addressing one favored by fortune but you seem to be in need of help
god knows i am
said the woman sadly
perhaps i can be of service to you
will you tell me how
neither i nor my child has tasted food since yesterday
well that can be easily remedied said dodger cheerfully
there is a restaurant close by
i was about to eat supper
will you come in with me
i am ashamed to impose upon the kindness of a stranger murmured the woman
don't mention it
i shall be very glad of company said dodger heartily
but you are a poor boy
you may be ill able to afford the expense
i am not a millionaire said dodger and i don't see any immediate prospect of my building a palace on nob hill where live some of san francisco's wealthiest citizens but i am very well supplied with money
then i will accept your kind invitation
it was a small restaurant but neat in its appointments and as in most san francisco restaurants the prices were remarkably moderate
at an expense of twenty five cents each the three obtained a satisfactory meal
the woman and child both seemed to enjoy it and dodger was glad to see that the former became more cheerful as time went on
there was something in the child's face that looked familiar to dodger
it was a resemblance to some one that he had seen but he could not for the life of him decide who it was
how can i ever thank you for your kindness
said the lady as she arose from the table
you don't know what it is to be famished don't i
asked dodger
i have been hungry more than once without money enough to buy a meal
you don't look it she said
no for now i have a good place and am earning a good salary
are you a native of san francisco
no madam
i can't tell you where i was born for i know little or nothing of my family
i have only been here a short time
i came from new york
so did i said the woman with a sigh
i wish i were back there again
how came you to be here
don't answer if you prefer not to dodger added hastily
i have no objection
my husband deserted me and left me to shift for myself and support my child
how have you done it
by taking in sewing
but that is a hard way of earning money
there are too many poor women who are ready to work for starvation wages and so we all suffer
i know that answered dodger
do you live near here
the woman mentioned a street near by
i have one poor back room on the third floor she explained but i should be glad if i were sure to stay there
is there any danger of your being ejected
i am owing for two weeks' rent and this is the middle of the third week
unless i can pay up at the end of this week i shall be forced to go out into the streets with my poor child
how much rent do you pay
a dollar a week
then three dollars will relieve you for the present
yes but it might as well be three hundred said the woman bitterly
not quite i can supply you with three dollars but three hundred would be rather beyond my means
you are too kind too generous
i ought not to accept such a liberal gift
mamma i am tired
take me up in your arms said the child
poor child
he has been on his feet all day sighed the mother
she tried to lift the child but her own strength had been undermined by privation and she was clearly unable to do so
let me take him
said dodger
here little one jump up
he raised the child easily and despite the mother's protest carried him in his arms
i will see you home madam he said
i fear the child will be too heavy for you
i hope not
why i could carry a child twice as heavy
they reached the room at last a poor one but a welcome repose from the streets
don't you ever expect to see your husband again
asked dodger
can't you compel him to support you
i don't know where he is answered the woman despondently
if you will tell me his name i may come across him some day
his name said the woman is curtis waring
dodger stared at her overwhelmed with surprise
chapter xxxiii
an important discovery
curtis waring
ejaculated dodger his face showing intense surprise
is that the name of your husband
yes
is it possible that you know him
asked the woman struck by dodger's tone
i know a man by that name
i will describe him and you can tell me whether it is he
he is rather tall dark hair sallow complexion black eyes and a long thin nose
it is like him in every particular
oh tell me where he is to be found
he lives in new york
he is the nephew of a rich man and is expecting to inherit his wealth
through his influence a cousin of his a young lady has been driven from home
was he afraid she would deprive him of the estate
that was partly the reason
but it was partly to revenge himself on her because she would not agree to marry him
but how could he marry her exclaimed the unfortunate woman when he is already married to me
neither she nor any one of his family or friends knew that he was already married
i don't think it would trouble him much
but it must be stopped
she exclaimed wildly
he is my husband
i shall not give him up to any one else
so far as florence is concerned she is the cousin she has no wish to deprive you of him
but is it possible that you are attached to a man who has treated you so meanly
asked dodger in surprise
there was a time when he treated me well when he appeared to love me was the murmured reply
i cannot forget that he is the father of my child
dodger did not understand the nature of women or the mysteries of the female heart and he evidently thought this poor woman very foolish to cling with such pertinacity to a man like curtis waring
do you mind telling me how you came to marry him
he asked
it was over four years ago that i met him in this city was the reply
i am a san francisco girl
i had never been out of california
i was considered pretty then she added with a remnant of pride faded as i am to day
looking closely in her face dodger was ready to believe this
grief and privation had changed her appearance but it had not altogether effaced the bloom and beauty of youth
at any rate he seemed to think so
he was living at the palace hotel and i made his acquaintance at a small social gathering at the house of my uncle
i am an orphan and was perhaps the more ready to marry on that account
did mr waring represent himself as wealthy
he said he had expectations from a wealthy relative but did not mention where he lived
he told the truth then
we married securing apartments on kearney street
we lived together till my child was born and for three months afterward
then mr waring claimed to be called away from san francisco on business
he said he might be absent six weeks
he left me a hundred dollars and urged me to be careful of it as he was short of money and needed considerable for the expenses of the journey
he left me and i have never seen or heard from him since
did he tell you where he was going mrs
waring
no he said he would be obliged to visit several places among others colorado where he claimed to have some mining property
he told me that he hoped to bring back considerable money
do you think he meant to stay away altogether
i don't know what to think
well i lived on patiently for i had perfect confidence in my husband
i made the money last me ten weeks instead of six but then i found myself penniless
did you receive any letters in that time
no and it was that that worried me
when at last the money gave out i began to pawn my things more than once i was tempted to pawn my wedding ring but i could not bring my mind to do that
i do not like to think ill of my husband and was forced as the only alternative to conclude that he had met with some accident perhaps had died
i have not felt certain that this was not so till you told me this evening that you know him
i can hardly say that i know him well yet i know him a good deal better than i wish i did
but for him i would not now be in san francisco
how is that
please explain
dodger told her briefly the story of his abduction
but what motive could he have in getting you out of new york
i cannot understand
i don't understand myself except that i am the friend of florence
his cousin
yes
but why should she be compelled to leave her uncle's home
because curtis waring made him set his heart upon the match
she had her choice to marry curtis or to leave the house and forfeit all chance of the estate
she chose to leave the house
she ought to know that he has no right to marry said the poor woman who not understanding the dislike of florence for the man whom she herself loved feared that she might yet be induced to marry him
she ought to know and her uncle ought to know said dodger
mrs waring i can't see my way clear yet
if i were in new york i would know just what to do
will you agree to stand by me and help me
yes i will answered the woman earnestly
i will see you again to morrow evening
here is some money to help you along for the present
good night
dodger as he walked away pondered over the remarkable discovery he had made
it was likely to prove of the utmost importance to florence
her uncle's displeasure was wholly based upon her refusal to marry curtis waring but if it should be proved to him that curtis was already a married man there would seem no bar to reconciliation
moreover and thas was particularly satisfactory it would bring curtis himself into disfavor
florence would be reinstated in her rightful place in her uncle's family and once more be recognized as heiress to at least a portion of his large fortune
this last consideration might not weigh so much with florence but dodger was more practical and he wished to restore her to the social position which she had lost through the knavery of her cousin
but in san francisco at a distance of over three thousand miles dodger felt at a loss how to act
even if mr linden was informed that his nephew had a wife living in san francisco the statement would no doubt be denied by curtis who would brand the woman as an impudent adventuress
the absent are always in the wrong says a french proverb
at all events they are very much at a disadvantage and therefore it seemed imperatively necessary not only that dodger but that curtis waring's wife should go to new york to confront the unprincipled man whose schemes had brought sorrow to so many
it was easy to decide what plan was best but how to carry it out presented a difficulty which seemed insurmountable
the expenses of a journey to new york for dodger mrs waring and her child would not be very far from five hundred dollars and where to obtain this money was a problem
randolph leslie probably had that sum but dodger could not in conscience ask him to lend it being unable to furnish adequate security or to insure repayment
if i could only find a nugget thought dodger knitting his brows everything would be easy
but nuggets are rare enough in the gold fields and still rarer in city streets
he who trusts wholly to luck trusts to a will o' the wisp and is about as sure of success as one who owns a castle in spain
the time might come when dodger by his own efforts could accumulate the needed sum but it would require a year at least and in that time mr linden would probably be dead
absorbed and disturbed by these reflections dodger walked slowly through the darkened streets till he heard a stifled cry and looking up beheld a sight that startled him
on the sidewalk lay the prostrate figure of a man
over him bludgeon in hand bent a ruffian whose purpose was only too clearly evident
chapter xxxiv
just in time
dodger who was a strong stout boy gathered himself up and dashed against the ruffian with such impetuosity that he fell over his intended victim and his bludgeon fell from his hand
it was the work of an instant to lift it and raise it in a menacing position
the discomfited villain broke into a volley of oaths and proceeded to pick himself up
he was a brutal looking fellow but was no larger than dodger who was as tall as the majority of men
give me that stick he exclaimed furiously
come and take it returned dodger undaunted
the fellow took him at his word and made a rush at our hero but a vigorous blow from the bludgeon made him cautious about repeating the attack
curse you
he cried between his teeth
i'd like to chaw you up
i have no doubt you would answered dodger but i don't think you will
were you going to rob this man
none of your business
i shall make it my business
you'd better go or you may be locked up
give me that stick then
you'll have to do without it
he made another rush and dodger struck him such a blow on his arm that he winced with pain
now i shall summon the police and you can do as you please about going
dodger struck the stick sharply on the sidewalk three times and the ruffian apprehensive of arrest ran around the corner just in time to rush into the arms of a policeman
what has this man been doing
asked the city guardian turning to dodger
he was about to rob this man
is the man hurt
where am i
asked the prostrate man in a bewildered tone
i will take care of him if you will take charge of that fellow
can you get up sir
asked dodger bending over the fallen man
the latter answered by struggling to his feet and looking about him in a confused way
where am i
he asked
what has happened
you were attacked by a ruffian
i found you on the sidewalk with him bending over you with this club in his hand
he must have followed me
i was imprudent enough to show a well filled pocketbook in a saloon where i stopped to take a drink
no doubt he planned to relieve me of it
you have had a narrow escape sir
i have no doubt of it
i presume the fellow was ready to take my life if he found it necessary
i will leave you now sir if you think you can manage
no stay with me
i feel rather upset
where are you staying sir
at the palace hotel
of course you know where that is
certainly
will you take my arm
thank you
little was said till they found themselves in the sumptuous hotel which hardly has an equal in america
come to my room young man i want to speak to you
it was still early in the evening and dodger's time was his own
he had no hesitation therefore in accepting the stranger's invitation
on the third floor the stranger produced a key and opened the door of a large handsomely furnished room
if you have a match please light the gas
dodger proceeded to do so and now for the first time obtained a good view of the man he had rescued
he was a man of about the average height probably not far from fifty dressed in a neat business suit and looked like a substantial merchant
please be seated
dodger sat down in an easy chair conveniently near him
young man said the stranger impressively you have done me a great favor
dodger felt that this was true and did not disclaim it
i am very glad i came up just as i did he said
how large a sum of money do you think i had about me
asked his companion
five hundred dollars
five hundred dollars
why that would be a mere trifle
it wouldn't be a trifle to me sir said dodger
are you poor
asked the man earnestly
i have a good situation that pays me fifteen dollars a week so i ought not to consider myself poor
suppose you had a considerable sum of money given you what would you do with it
if i had five hundred dollars i should be able to defeat the schemes of a villain and restore a young lady to her rights
that seems interesting
tell me the circumstances
dodger told the story as briefly as he could
he was encouraged to find that the stranger listened to him with attention
do you know he said reflectively you have done for me what i once did for another a rich man
the case was very similar
i was a poor boy at the time
do you know what he gave me
what was it sir
a dollar
what do you think of that for generosity
well sir it wasn't exactly liberal
did you accept it
no
i told him that i didn't wish to inconvenience him
but i asked you how much money you supposed i had
i will tell you
in a wallet i have eleven thousand dollars in bank notes and securities
that is a fortune said dodger dazzled at the mention of such a sum
if i had lost it i have plenty more but the most serious peril was to my life
through your opportune assistance i have escaped without loss
i fully appreciate the magnitude of the service you have done me
as an evidence of it please accept these bills
he drew from the roll two bills and handed them to dodger
the boy glancing at them mechanically started in amazement
each bill was for five hundred dollars
you have given me a thousand dollars
he gasped
i am aware of it
i consider my life worth that at least
james swinton never fails to pay his debts
but sir a thousand dollars it's no more than you deserve
when i tell my wife on my return to chicago about this affair she will blame me for not giving you more
you seem to belong to a liberal family sir
i detest meanness and would rather err on the side of liberality
now if agreeable to you i will order a bottle of champagne and solace ourselves for this little incident
thank you mr swinton but i have made up my mind not to drink anything stronger than water
i have tended bar in new york and what i have seen has given me a dislike for liquor of any kind
you are a sensible young man
you are right and i won't urge you
there is my card and if you ever come to chicago call upon me
i will sir
when dodger left the palace hotel he felt that he was a favorite of fortune
it is not always that the money we need is so quickly supplied
he resolved to return to new york as soon as he could manage it and take with him the wife and child of curtis waring
this would cost him about five hundred dollars and he would have the same amount left
mr tucker was reluctant to part with dodger
you are the best assistant i ever had he said
i will pay you twenty dollars a week if that will induce you to stay
i would stay if it were not very important for me to return to new york mr tucker
i do not expect to get a place in new york as good
if you come back to san francisco at any time i will make a place for you
thank you sir
mrs waring was overjoyed when dodger called upon her and offered to take her back to new york
i shall see curtis again she said
how can i ever thank you
but dodger though unwilling to disturb her dreams of happiness thought it exceedingly doubtful if her husband would be equally glad to see her
chapter xxxv
the darkest day
when florence left the employ of mrs leighton she had a few dollars as a reserve fund
as this would not last long she at once made an effort to obtain employment
she desired another position as governess and made application in answer to an advertisement
her ladylike manner evidently impressed the lady to whom she applied
i suppose you have taught before
she said
yes madam
in whose family
i taught the daughter of mrs leighton of west street
i have heard of the lady
of course you are at liberty to refer to her
yes madam but there was a hesitation in her tone that excited suspicion
very well i will call upon her and make inquiries
if you will call to morrow morning i can give you a decisive answer
florence fervently hoped that this might prove favorable but was apprehensive and with good reason it appeared
when she presented herself the next day mrs cole said i am afraid miss linden you will not suit me
may i ask why
florence inquired schooling herself to calmness
i called on mrs leighton was the answer
she speaks well of you as a teacher but she told me some things which make it seem inexpedient to engage you
what did she say of me
that perhaps you had better not inquire
i prefer to know the worst
she said you encouraged the attentions of her nephew forgetting the difference in social position and also that your connections were not of a sort to recommend you
i admit miss linden that you are very ladylike in appearance but i can hardly be expected to admit into my house in the important position of governess to my child the daughter or niece of an apple woman
did mrs leighton say that i was related to an apple woman
yes miss linden
i own i was surprised
it is not true mrs
cole
you live in the house of such a person do you not
yes she is an humble friend of mine and has been kind to me
you cannot be very fastidious
however that is your own affair
i am sorry to disappoint you miss linden but it will be quite impossible for me to employ you
then i will bid you good morning mrs cole said florence sore at heart
good morning
you will i think understand my position
if you applied for a position in one of the public schools i don't think that your residence would be an objection
florence left the house sad and despondent
she saw that mrs leighton by her unfriendly representations would prevent her from getting any opportunity to teach
she must seek some more humble employment
well florence did you get a place
asked mrs o'keefe as she passed that lady's stand
no mrs o'keefe answered florence wearily
and why not
did the woman think you didn't know enough
she objected to me because i was not living in a fashionable quarter at least that was one of her objections
i'm sure you've got a nate clane home and it looks as nate as wax all the time
it isn't exactly stylish said florence with a faint smile
you are at any rate
what does the woman want i'd like to know
she doesn't want me
it seems mrs leighton did not speak very highly of me
the trollop
i'd like to give her a box on the ear drat her impudence
said the irate apple woman
and what will you be doin' now
do you think i can get some sewing to do mrs
o'keefe
yes miss florence i'll get you some vests to make but it's hard work and poor pay
i must take what i can get sighed florence
i cannot choose
if you'd only tend an apple stand miss florence
there's mrs brady wants to sell out on account of the rheumatics and i've got a trifle in the savings bank enough to buy it
you'd make a dollar a day easy
it isn't to be thought of mrs o'keefe
if you will kindly see about getting me some sewing i will see how i can get along
the result was that mrs o'keefe brought florence in the course of the day half a dozen vests for which she was to be paid the munificent sum of twenty five cents each
florence had very little idea of what she was undertaking
she was an expert needlewoman and proved adequate to the work but with her utmust industry she could only make one vest in a day and that would barely pay her rent
true she had some money laid aside on which she could draw but that would soon be expended and then what was to become of her
shure i won't let you starve florence said the warm hearted apple woman
but mrs o'keefe i can't consent to live on you
and why not
i'm well and strong and i'm makin' more money than i nade
i couldn't think of it though i thank you for your kindness
shure you might write a letter to your uncle florence
he would expect me in that case to consent to a marriage with curtis
you wouldn't advise me to do that
no he's a mane blackguard and i'd say it to his face
weeks rolled by and florence began to show the effects of hard work and confinement
she grew pale and thin and her face was habitually sad
she had husbanded her savings as a governess as closely as she could but in spite of all her economy it dwindled till she had none left
henceforth she must depend on twenty five cents a day and this seemed well nigh impossible
in this emergency the pawnbroker occurred to her
she had a variety of nice dresses and she had also a handsome ring given her by her uncle on her last birthday
this she felt sure must have cost fifty dollars
it was a trial to part with it but there seemed to be no alternative
if my uncle has withdrawn his affection from me she said to herself why should i scruple to pawn the ring
it is the symbol of a love that no longer exists
so she entered the pawnbrowker's the first that attracted her attention and held out the ring
how much will you lend me on this
she asked half frightened at finding herself in such a place
the pawnbroker examined it carefully
his practiced eye at once detected its value but it was not professional to admit this
rings is a drug in the market young lady he said
i've got more than i know what to do with
i'll give you four four dollars
four dollars
repeated florence in dismay
why it must have cost fifty
it was bought in tiffany's
you are mistaken my dear
did you buy it yourself there
no my uncle gave it to me
he may have said he paid fifty dollars for it said the pawnbroker wagging his head but we know better
but what will you give
asked florence desperately
i'll give you five dollars and not a penny more said the broker surveying her distressed face shrewdly
you can take it or not
what could florence do
she must have money and feared that no other pawnbroker would give her more
make out the ticket then she said wearily with a sigh
this was done and she left the place half timid half ashamed and wholly discouraged
but the darkest hour is sometimes nearest the dawn
a great overwhelming surprise awaited her
she had scarcely left the shop when a glad voice cried i have found you at last florence
she looked up and saw dodger
but not the old dodger
she saw a nicely dressed young gentleman larger than the friend she had parted with six months before with a brighter more intelligent and manly look
dodger
she faltered
yes it is dodger
where did you come from
from san francisco
but what have you been doing there
and dodger pointed in the direction of the pawnbroker's shop
i pawned my ring
then i shall get it back at once
how much did you get on it
five dollars
give me the ticket and go in with me
the pawnbroker was very reluctant to part with the ring which he made sure would not be reclaimed but there was no help for it
as they emerged into the street dodger said i've come back to restore you to your rights and give curtis waring the most disagreeable surprise he ever had
come home and i'll tell you all about it
i've struck luck florence and you're going to share it
chapter xxxvi
mrs o'keefe in a new role
no time was lost in seeing bolton and arranging a plan of campaign
curtis waring nearing the accomplishment of his plans was far from anticipating impending disaster
his uncle's health had become so poor and his strength had been so far undermined that it was thought desirable to employ a sick nurse
an advertisement was inserted in a morning paper which luckily attracted the attention of bolton
you must go mrs o'keefe he said to the apple woman
it is important that we have some one in the house some friend of florence and the boy to watch what is going on
bridget o'keefe is no fool
leave her to manage
the result was that among a large number of applicants mrs o'keefe was selected by curtis as mr linden's nurse as she expressed herself willing to work for four dollars a week while the lowest outside demand was seven
we will now enter the house in which the last scenes of our story are to take place
mr linden weak and emaciated was sitting in an easy chair in his library
how do you feel this morning uncle
asked curtis entering the room
i am very weak curtis
i don't think i shall ever be any better
i have engaged a nurse uncle as you desired and i expect her this morning
that is well curtis
i do not wish to confine you to my bedside
the nurse is below said jane the servant entering
send her up
mrs o'keefe entered in the sober attire of a nurse
she dropped a curtsey
are you the nurse i engaged
said curtis
yes sir
your name please
mrs barnes sir
have you experience as a nurse
plenty sir
uncle this is mrs barnes your new nurse
i hope you will find her satisfactory
she looks like a good woman said mr linden feebly
i think she will suit me
indade sir i'll try
uncle said curtis i have to go downtown
i have some business to attend to
i leave you in the care of mrs
barnes
shure i'll take care of him sir
is there anything i can do for you mr
linden
asked the new nurse in a tone of sympathy
can you minister to a mind diseased
i'll take the best care of you mr linden but it isn't as if you had a wife or daughter
ah that is a sore thought
i have no wife or daughter but i have a niece
and where is she sir
i don't know
i drove her from me by my unkindness
i repent bitterly but it's now too late
and why don't you send for her to come home
i would gladly do so but i don't know where she is
curtis has tried to find her but in vain
he says she is in chicago
and what should take her to chicago
he says she is there as a governess in a family
by the brow of st
patrick
thought mrs o'keefe if that curtis isn't a natural born liar
i'm sure she'd come back if you'd send for her sir said she aloud
do you think so
asked linden eagerly
i'm sure of it
but i don't know where to send
i know of a party that would be sure to find her
who is it
it's a young man
they call him dodger
if any one can find miss florence he can
you know my niece's name
i have heard it somewhere
from mr waring i think
and you think this young man would agree to go to chicago and find her
yes sir i make bold to say he will
tell him to go at once
he will need money
in yonder desk you will find a picture of my niece and a roll of bills
give them to him and send him at once
yes sir i will
but if you'll take my advice you won't say anything to mr curtis
he might think it foolish
true
if your friend succeeds we'll give curtis a surprise
and a mighty disagreeable one i'll be bound soliloquized mrs o'keefe
i think mrs barnes i will retire to my chamber if you will assist me
she assisted mr linden to his room and then returned to the library
mrs barnes there's a young man inquiring for you said jane entering
send him in jane
the visitor was dodger neatly dressed
how are things going mrs
o'keefe
he asked
splendid dodger
here's some money for you
what for
you're to go to chicago and bring back florence
but she isn't there
nivir mind
you're to pretend to go
but that won't take money
give it to florence then
it's hers by rights
won't we give curtis a surprise
where's his wife
i have found a comfortable boarding house for her
when had we better carry out this programme
she's very anxious to see her husband
the more fool she
kape her at home and out of his sight or there's no knowin' what he'll do
and dodger dear kape an eye on the apple stand
i mistrust mrs burke that's runnin' it
i will
does the old gentleman seem to be very sick
he's wake as a rat
curtis would kill him soon if we didn't interfere
but we'll soon circumvent him the snake in the grass
miss florence will soon come to her own and curtis waring will be out in the cold
the most i have against him is that he tried to marry florence when he had a wife already
he's as bad as they make 'em dodger
it won't be my fault if mr linden's eyes are not opened to his wickedness
chapter xxxvii
the diplomacy of mrs o'keefe
mrs o'keefe was a warm hearted woman and the sad drawn face of mr linden appealed to her pity
why should i let the poor man suffer when i can relieve him
she asked herself
so the next morning after curtis had according to his custom gone downtown being in the invalid's sick chamber she began to act in a mysterious manner
she tiptoed to the door closed it and approached mr linden's bedside with the air of one about to unfold a strange story
whist now she said with her finger on her lips
what is the matter
asked the invalid rather alarmed
can you bear a surprise sir
have you any bad news for me
no it's good news but you must promise not to tell curtis
is it about florence
your messenger can hardly have reached chicago
he isn't going there sir
but you promised that he should said mr linden disturbed
i'll tell you why sir
florence is not in chicago
i i don't understand
you said she was there
begging your pardon sir it was curtis that said so though he knew she was in new york
but what motive could he have had for thus misrepresenting matters
he doesn't want you to take her back
i can't believe you mrs barnes
he loves her and wants to marry her
he couldn't marry her if she consented to take him
why not
mrs barnes you confuse me
i won't deceive you as he has done
there's rason in plinty
he's married already
is this true
demanded mr linden in excitement
it's true enough more by token to morrow whin he's out his wife will come here and tell you so herself
but who are you who seem to know so much about my family
i'm a friend of the pore girl you've driven from the house because she would not marry a rascally spalpeen that's been schemin' to get your property into his hands
you're a friend of florence
where is she
she's in my house and has been there ever since she left her home
is she well
as well as she can be whin she's been workin' her fingers to the bone wid sewin' to keep from starvin'
my god
what have i done
you've let curtis waring wind you around his little finger that's what you've done mr
linden
how soon can i see florence
how soon can you bear it
the sooner the better
then it'll be to morrow i'm thinkin' that is if you won't tell curtis
no no i promise
i'll manage everything sir
don't worry now
mr linden's face lost its anxious look so that when later in the day curtis looked into the room he was surprised
my uncle looks better he said
yes sir answered the nurse
i've soothed him like
indeed
you seem to be a very accomplished nurse
faith that i am sir though it isn't i that should say it
may i ask how you soothed him
inquired curtis anxiously
i told him that miss florence would soon be home
i do not think it right to hold out hopes that may prove ill founded
i know what i am about mr
curtis
i dare say you understand your business mrs barnes but if my uncle should be disappointed i am afraid the consequences will be lamentable
do you think he'll live long sir
curtis shrugged his shoulders
it is very hard to tell
my uncle is a very feeble man
and if he dies i suppose the property goes to you
i suppose so
but where does florence come in
it seems to me mrs barnes that you take a good deal of interest in our family affairs said curtis suspiciously
that's true sir
why shouldn't i take an interest in a nice gentleman like you
curtis smiled
i am doing my best to find florence
then our marriage will take place and it matters little to whom the property is left
but i thought miss florence didn't care to marry you
it is only because she thinks cousins ought not to marry
it's a foolish fancy and she'll get over it
thrue for you sir
my first husband was my cousin and we always agreed barrin' an occasional fight i don't think florence and i will ever fight mrs
barnes
what surprises me mr curtis is that a nice lookin' gentleman like you hasn't been married before
curtis eyed her keenly but her face told him nothing
i never saw one i wanted to marry till my cousin grew up he said
i belave in marryin' meself
i was first married at sivinteen
how long ago was that mrs
barnes
it's long ago mr curtis
i'm an old woman now
i was thirty five last birthday
curtis came near laughing outright for he suspected what was true that the nurse would never see her fiftieth birthday again
then you are just my age he said
if i make him laugh he won't suspect nothing soliloquized the wily nurse
that's a pretty big lie even for me
shure i look older mr curtis she said aloud
what wid the worry of losin' two fond husbands i look much older than you
oh your are very well preserved mrs
barnes
curtis went into his uncle's chamber
how are you feeling uncle
he asked
i think i am better answered mr linden coldly for he had not forgotten mrs barnes' revelations
that is right
only make an effort and you will soon be strong again
i think i may
i may live ten years to annoy you
i fervently hope so said curtis but there was a false ring in his voice that his uncle detected
how do you like the new nurse
she is helping me wonderfully
you made a good selection
i will see that she is soon discharged curtis inwardly resolved
if her being here is to prolong my uncle's life and keep me still waiting for the estate i must clear the house of her
you must not allow her to buoy you up with unfounded hopes
she has been telling you that florence will soon return
yes she seems convinced of it
of course she knows nothing of it
she may return but i doubt whether she is in chicago now
i think the family she was with has gone to europe
where did you hear that curtis
asked mr linden with unwonted sharpness
i have sources of information which at present i do not care to impart
rest assured that i am doing all i can to get her back
you still want to marry her curtis
i do most certainly
i shall not insist upon it
i should not have done so before
have you changed your mind uncle
yes i have made a mistake and i have decided to correct it
what has come over him
curtis asked himself
some influence hostile to me has been brought to bear
it must be that nurse
i will quietly dismiss her to morrow paying her a week's wages in lieu of warning
she's evidently a meddler
chapter xxxviii
the closing scene
the next day tim bolton dressed in a jaunty style walked up the steps of the linden mansion
is mr waring at home
he asked
no sir he has gone downtown
i'll step in and wait for him
please show me to the library
jane who had been taken into confidence by the nurse showed him at once into the room mentioned
half an hour later curtis entered
how long have you been here bolton
but a short time
you sent for me
i did
on business
well yes
is there anything new
yes my uncle is failing fast
is he likely to die soon
i shouldn't be surprised if he died within a week
i suspect curtis means to help him
well what has that to do with me
he asked
you will step into the property of course
there is a little difficulty in the way which i can overcome with your help
what is it
i can't get him to give up the foolish notion that the boy he lost is still alive
it happens to be true
yes but he must not know it
before he dies i want him to make a new will revoking all others leaving all the property to me
will he do it
i don't know
as long as he thinks the boy is living i don't believe he will
you see what a drawback that is
i see
what can i do to improve the situation
i want you to sign a paper confessing that you abducted the boy at your instigation
that must not be mentioned
you will go on to say that a year or two later the time is not material he died of typhoid fever
you can say that you did not dare to reveal this before but do so now impelled by remorse
have you got it written out
i can't remember all them words
yes here it is
all right said bolton taking the paper and tucking it into an inside pocket
i'll copy it out in my own handwriting
how much are you going to give me for doing this
a thousand dollars
cash
i can't do that
i have met with losses at the gaming table and i don't dare ask money from my uncle at this time
he thinks i am thoroughly steady
at how much do you value the estate
at four hundred thousand dollars
i wormed it out of my uncle's lawyer the other day
and you expect me to help you to that amount for only a thousand dollars
a thousand dollars is a good deal of money
and so is four hundred thousand
after all your uncle may not die
he is sure to
you seem very confident
and with good reason
leave that to me
i promise you on my honor to pay you two thousand dollars when i get the estate
but what is going to happen to poor dodger the rightful heir
well let it be three hundred dollars a year then
where is he now
i don't mind telling you as it can do no harm
he is in california
whew
that was smart
how did you get him there
i drugged him and had him sent on board a ship bound for san francisco around cape horn
the fact is i was getting a little suspicious of you and i wanted to put you beyond the reach of temptation
you are a clever rascal curtis
after all suppose the prize should slip through your fingers
it won't
i have taken every precaution
when do you want this document
bring it back to me this afternoon copied and signed
that is all you have to do i will attend to the rest
while this conversation was going on there were unseen listeners
behind a portiere mrs barnes the nurse and john linden heard every word that was said
and what do you think now sir
whispered mrs o'keefe to give her real name
it is terrible
i would not have believed curtis capable of such a crime
but is it really true mrs barnes
is my lost boy alive
to be sure he is
have you seen him
i know him as well as i know you sir and better too
is he tell me is he a good boy
curtis told me that he might be a criminal
he might but he isn't
he's as dacent and honest a boy as iver trod shoe leather
you'll be proud of him sir
but he's in california
he was but he's got back
you shall see him to day and florence too
hark
i hear the door bell
they're here now
i think you had better go in and confront curtis
i feel weak mrs barnes
let me lean on you
you can do that and welcome sir
the nurse pushed aside the portiere and the two entered the library mrs barnes rotund and smiling mr linden gaunt and spectral looking like one risen from the grave
curtis eyed the pair with a startled look
mrs barnes he said angrily what do you mean by taking my uncle from his bed and bringing him down here
it is as much as his life is worth
you seem unfit for your duties as nurse
you will leave the house to morrow and i will engage a substitute
i shall lave whin i git ready mr curtis waring said the nurse her arms akimbo
maybe somebody else will lave the house
me and mr linden have been behind the curtain for twenty minutes and he has heard every word you said
curtis turned livid and his heart sank
it's true curtis said john linden's hollow voice
i have heard all
it was you who abducted my boy and have made my life a lonely one all these years
oh man
man
how could you have the heart to do it
curtis stared at him with parched lips unable to speak
not content with this you drove from the house my dear niece florence
you made me act cruelly toward her
i fear she will not forgive me
but just then the door opened and florence rushing into the room sank at her uncle's feet
oh uncle she said will you take me back
yes florence never again to leave me
and who is this
he asked fixing his eyes on dodger who stood shyly in the doorway
i'll tell you sir said tim bolton
that is your own son whom i stole away from you when he was a kid being hired to do it by curtis waring
it's a lie said curtis hoarsely
come to me my boy said mr linden with a glad light in his eyes
at last heaven has heard my prayers he ejaculated
we will never be separated
i was ready to die but now i hope to live for many years
i feel that i have a new lease of life
with a baffled growl curtis waring darted a furious look at the three
that boy is an impostor he said
they are deceiving you
he is my son
i see his mother's look in his face
as for you curtis waring my eyes are open at last to your villainy
you deserve nothing at my hands but i will make some provision for you
there was another surprise
curtis waring's deserted wife brought from california by dodger entered the room leading by the hand a young child
oh curtis she said reproachfully
how could you leave me
i have come to you my husband with our little child
begone
woman
said curtis furiously
i will never receive or recognize you
oh sir
she said turning to mr linden what shall i do
curtis waring said mr linden sternly unless you receive this woman and treat her properly you shall receive nothing from me
and if i do
you will receive an income of two thousand dollars a year payable quarterly
mrs waring you will remain here with your child till your husband provides another home for you
curtis slunk out of the room but he was too wise to refuse his uncle's offer
he and his wife are living in chicago and he treats her fairly well fearing that otherwise he will lose his income
mr linden looks ten years younger than he did at the opening of the story
florence and dodger now known as harvey linden live with him
dodger under a competent private tutor is making up the deficiencies in his education
it is early yet to speak of marriage but it is possible that florence may marry a cousin after all
tim bolton has turned over a new leaf given up his saloon and is carrying on a country hotel within fifty miles of new york
he has five thousand dollars in the bank presented by dodger with his father's sanction and is considered quite a reputable citizen
as for mrs o'keefe she still keeps the apple stand being unwilling to give it up but she too has a handsome sum in the bank and calls often upon her two children as she calls them
in the midst of their prosperity florence and dodger will never forget the time when they were adrift in new york
